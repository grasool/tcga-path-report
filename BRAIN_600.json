Right insular tumor: astrocytoma with mitotic activity. see \ncomment. \nComment:  TCGA-CS-4942 \nThe tumor in specimens #1 and #2 contains fibrillary astrocytoma \ncomposed of moderately pleomorphic fibrillary astrocytes. Rare but \nmultiple mitoses are present in both specimens #1 and #2. Two mitotic \nf; \u00b71res are identified in specimen #1 (slide 18) and two mitotic \ntol:1ures are identified in specimen #2 (slide 28). The proliferation \nindex as determined by Ki67 (MI8-1) staining is greater than 5% in \nsmall foci of specimen #2 (slide 2A). The identification of rare \nmitoses and a focally elevated proliferation index suggest that this \nastrocytic tumor is an astrocytoma (WHO grade II) in the process of \ntransformation to a higher grade tumor or that these tumor biopsies are \nfrom a higher grade tumor.

Epidermal growth factor receptor variant \nIII \n(EGFRvIII) is an oncogenic, constitutively active mutant form of EGFR \nthat is \ncommonly expressed in glioblastoma. Cell culture and in vivo models of \nglioblastoma have demonstrated EGFRvIII as defining prognostically \ndistinct \nsub~roups of \u00b7\"glioblastomas. Additionally I the presence of EGFRvIII has \nbeen \nshown to sensitize tumors to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors when the \ntumor \nsuppressor protein PTEN is intact. RNA is extracted from formalin \nfixed, \nparaffin embedded tissue samples and reverse transcribed to cDNA. The \ncDNA is \nthen amplified using standard PCR technique for DNA templates.

All markers are microsatellites \n(2 or 4 \nnt repeats) except PLA2G4C which is a minisatellite (26 nt repeat) \npolymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score, \namplicon size, and ease of interpretation.

Though in many areas the\ncells assume an oligodendroglial profile, in other areas more pleomorphic\nelements with astrocytic appearance are present.

Cells with no signals or with signals of\nonly one color are disregarded. References ranges for our laboratory for\nallelic loss versus no allelic loss were established by evaluating both\nprobe sets in a series of 40 normal cases from 10 different organs.

The 3 \nmarkers \non Ip are D1S548, D1S1592, and D1S552 (with D1S468, D1S1612, and \nD1S496 as \nbackup markers) and the 3 markers on 19q are D19S219, D19S412, and \nPLA2G4C \n(with D19S606 and D19S1182 as backup). All markers are microsatellites \n(2 or 4 \nnt repeats) except PLA2G4C which is a minisatellite (26 nt repeat) \npolymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score, \namplicon size, and ease of interpretation. The backup markers are used \nif the \nfirst line markers at that chromosome arm are uninformative or \notherwise \nambiguous in their interpretation. LOR at all informative loci on each \nchromosomal arm represents the typical finding in oligodendrogliomas \nwith Ip \nand 19q deletion. \nFDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results \nfrom a \nstand-alone diagnostic test.

Epidermal growth factor receptor variant\nIII\n(EGFRvIII) is an oncogenic, constitutively active mutant form of EGFR that is commonly expressed in\nglioblastoma. Cell culture and in vivo models of glioblastoma have demonstrated EGFRvIII as defining prognostically\ndistinct\nsubgroups of glioblastomas .Additionally ,the presence of EGFRvIII has been shown to sensitize tumors\nto EGFR\ntyrosine kinase inhibitors when the tumor suppressor protein PTEN is intact. RNA is extracted from\nformalin fixed,\nparaffin embedded tissue samples and reverse transcribed to cDNA. The cDNA is then amplified using\nstandard PCR\ntechnique for DNA templates. PCR products are detected by gel electrophoresis. The limit of detection of\nthis assay\nhas been determined to be approximately 5 mutant cells in 100 normal cells.\nFDA Comment :The above data are not to be construed as the results from a stand alone diagnostic test.\nThis test\nwas developed and its performance characteristics determined by the\nas required\nby CLIA '88 regulations.

DNA extracted from a\ncorresponding\nblood specimen was used as a normal reference control.\nH and E slide was examined and no microdissection was needed.\nTEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA (baseline)/ Tumor DNA\npairs using 3\nmarkers at both 1 p and 19q. The 3 markers on 1 p are D1 S548, D1 S1592, and D1 S552 (with D1 S468,\nD1 S1612, and\nD1S496 as backup markers) and the 3 markers on 19q are D19S219, D19S412, and PLA2G4C (with\nD19S606 and\nD19S1182 as backup). All markers are microsatellites (2 or 4 nt repeats) except PLA2G4C which is a\nminisatellite (26\nnt repeat) polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score, amplicon size, and\nease of\ninterpretation. The backup markers are used if the first line markers at that chromosome arm are\nuninformative or\notherwise ambiguous in their interpretation.

Assessment of MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite\ntreatment of\nDNA followed by real-time PCR amplification of methylated and unmethylated DNA\nsequences. The\nanalytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by serial dilution of methylated positive control DNA into\nunmethylated DNA, and was assessed to be 1% of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated\nDNA.

There is no evidence of allelic loss on the short arm of chromosome 1 (1p).  19q intact: A majority of nuclei showed similar numbers of 19q13 and 19p13 signals. THere is no evidence of allelic loss of 19q.  Allelic loss at one locus does not necessarily predict the presence of alterations at other loci on the same chromosome, i.e. FISH may not detect partial allelic loss. FISH may not detect allelic losses if there is loss of one allele and replication on the allele.  \nComment:  \nSeveral days after unstained slides from block A2 were received, additional unstained slides from \nblock B1 were received. This was discussed with Dr. Mark Cohen on 2011. The unstained slides from \nblock B1 will not be stained and will be returned.  \n Allelic loss on chromosome 1p has been shown to correlate with with chemoresponsiveness and long progression-free surival in some gliomas. This correlation is stronger when there is concomitant allelic loss on 19q. An association of chemoresponsiveness and/or long progression-free survivl with allelic loss on 19q in the absence of loss on 1p has not been established. In patients with 1p/19q loss,\n \nMethod:   \nThe integrity of the short arm of chromosome 1 (1p) and long arm of chromosome 19 (19q) was \nevaluated with interphase florescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using locus-specific probes target (1p36, 19q13) and reference probes (1q25,19p13) (Abbott Meloecular/Vysis, des Plaines, IL). The analysis was performed on areas of glial neoplasm and only atypical nuclei with two or more reference probe signals were counted. Reported quantitavtive data represents an average of 40 nuclei. Loss is defined as a ratio of less than or eugual to 0.7./ Aneusomy is defined as a mean of greater that or equal to 3.0 for the reference probe signals (1q25, 19p13).  \n \nANALYTE SPECIFIC REAGENT (ASR) DISCLAIMER \nNOTE:  One or more of the reagents used to perform assays on this specimen MAY have contained \ncomponents considered to be analyte specific reagents (ASRs).

Deep to cyst wall: White matter with cyst wall lined by moderately cellular, viable tumor.\nComment :This astrocytoma diffusely infiltrates white and gray matter. In some areas, especially the cyst\nwall, the cells are as^ocjated with prominent microcystic change. Tumor cells have moderately\npleomorphic astrocytic nuclei, some naked and others with gemistocytic cytoplasm; other areas have a\nmore round, monotonous pattern suggestive of an oligodendroglioma component. Immunostain for p53 is\ndiffusely positive, however, arguing against an oligodendroglioma. Perineuronal satellitosis is seen. No\nevidence of an underlying grade 1 tumor is seen (i.e. no EGBs, Rosethal fibers or noninfiltrative areas).\nNo mitoses are present. Though the cellularity and pleomorphism are in some areas pronounced, no\nmitoses, vascular endothelial proliferation or necrosis are present. Immunostain for MIB-1 (slide C3)\nshows a nuclear labeling rate of up to 6% (rates of greater than 3% are considered likely to represent\nanaplastic change by Burger et al., Surgical Pathology of the Nervous System and its Coverings, 4th ed.).\nThus the tumor is WHO grade 2, but is likely to represent early anaplastic change .Molecular testing for\nMGMT, 1 p 19q are in progress.\nBRAIN :Resection\nMACROSCOPIC\nSpecimen Type\nX Resection\nSpecimen Size\nGreatest dimension : 4.3 x 4 x up to 2.7 cm\nTumor Site\nX Cerebrum: right frontal\nTumor Size\nX Cannot be determined\nMICROSCOPIC\nHistologic Type\nX Astrocytoma, diffuse\nHistologic Grade\nX WHO Grade 2\ngaged o 7 Margins\nX Cannot be assessed\n*Additional Studies , .\n*-X-Molecular testing (specify): See above\nFrozen Section Diagnosis:\nA.

The differential diagnosis is between lymphoma and a \nglioma. \n,u>'~\"~rIVE CONSULTATION: Astrocytoma, anaplastic \nGROSS PATHOLOGY: Specimen received in a container labeled with the \npatient's name and MRN. A portion of this specimen is used for the \nintraoperative consultation and for fixation in glutaraldehyde for \neventual electron microscopy. The total amount of tissue removed \nequals \napproximately 5.0 9 and all remaining fragments are submitted in six \ntissue cassettes. \nMICROSCOPIC: Fragments of cerebral cortex and underlying white matter \nshowing multiple, focal and diffuse infiltrates by small neoplastic \ncells that in general lack differentiation. In many areas the cells \nsurrund individual neurons and in small sites they show some degree of \ncytoplasmic differentiation which appears similar to that of an \nastrocyte. There are mUltiple perivascular nests of neoplastic cells. \nAreas of coagUlation necrosis or atypical mitosis are not readily \nidentified, however the general impression is that this pattern of \ntissue infiltrate may represent distant extension of a rather \naggressive type of undifferentiated neoplasm. \nIn summary, the impression formed at the time of the intraoperative \nconsultation that this represents a small cell glioma with very \nanaplastic features is sustained by the evidence available at this  time. In an attempt to further identify the genetic derivation of \nthese cells additional sections will be cut and reacted with various \nantisera as follows: GFAP, LCA, EMA, CK-6, Synaptophysin and MIB-1. \nIn addition one of the samples taken for electron microscopy will be \nevaluated. \nAn addendum will be issued when all of these are completed. \nCOMMENT: Additional sections were cut from several blocks and reacted \nwith the following antisera: LCA, EMA, CK-6, and Synaptophysin; these \nare negative in all the neoplastic cells. These results are \ninterpreted as confirming the initial impression that the derivation \nof \nthese cells is not from lymphocytes, neuronal elements, or epithelial \ncells. GFAP is expressed by approximately 20% of the neoplastic \ncells. \nMIB-1: This protein is expressed by diverse percentages of cells in \nvarious locations; however! the mean percentage of cells expressing \nthis protein is estimated to be about 10%. \nSections evaluated with the electron microscope confirm the impression \nthat the cytoplasmic features as well as the nuclei of most neoplastic \ncells are compatible with those characteristic of a neoplastic \nastrocyte. \nA letter from Dr. \nin agreement with \ninvoluntary delay in the issuance of this final report represents a \ncombination of simultaneous events including my absence from the \ndepartment for over two weeks, and the fact that the slides were is \nmailed \nto Dr. IIIIIIIfor consultation before dictating the addendum, and his \nreply was not opportunely delivered to the pathologist on call during \nmy absence . .... \nTISSUE COMMITTEE CODE: II1II \nBILLING CODESIIIIIIIII ",

There is no evidence of allelic loss on the short arm of chromosome 1 (1p).  19q intact: A majority of nuclei showed similar numbers of 19q13 and 19p13 signals. There is no evidence of allelic loss of 19q.  Allelic loss at one locus does not necessarily predict the presence of alterations at other loci on the same chromosome, i.e. FISH may not detect partial allelic loss. FISH may not detect allelic losses if there is loss of one allele and replication on the allele.  \nComment:  \nAllelic loss on chromosome 1p has been shown to correlate with with chemoresponsiveness and long \nprogression-free survival in some gliomas. This correlation is stronger when there is concomitant \nallelic loss on 19q. An association of chemoresponsiveness and/or long progression-free survival with allelic loss on 19q in the absence of loss on 1p has not been established. In patients with 1p/19q loss,\n \nMethod:   \nThe integrity of the short arm of chromosome 1 (1p) and long arm of chromosome 19 (19q) was \nevaluated with interphase florescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using locus-specific probes target (1p36, 19q13) and reference probes (1q25,19p13) (Abbott Melecular/Vysis, des Plaines, IL). The analysis was performed on areas of glial neoplasm and only atypical nuclei with two or more reference probe signals were counted. Reported quantitative data represents an average of 40 nuclei. Loss is defined as a ratio of less than or equal to 0.7./ Aneusomy is defined as a mean of greater that or equal to 3.0 for the reference probe signals (1q25, 19p13).  \n \nANALYTE SPECIFIC REAGENT (ASR) DISCLAIMER  \nThis test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the Pathology and \nLaboratory Medicine Institute at the Cleveland Clinic. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not approved or cleared this test; however, FDA clearance or approval is not currently required for clinical use. \n \nNOTE:  One or more of the reagents used to perform assays on this specimen MAY have contained \ncomponents considered to be analyte specific reagents (ASRs).

Malignant glioma, pleomorphic, superficial (WHO III). \n2. MIB-l proliferation index: 35%. \nSee Microscopy Description and Comment. \nCOMMENT \nThe neoplasm is a malignant proliferation of spindle/epithelioid cells that \nhave prominent pleomorphism, focally brisk mitotic activity, and a high MIB-l \nproliferation index of about 35% throughout. The tumor is superficial, is \ngrowing focally in the leptomeningeal space, and has a prominent reticulin \nnetwork. The tumor heavily infiltrates the brain, at its margins has \nastrocytic differentiation, and contains numerous eosinophilic granular \nbodies. Xanthomatous cells are found occasionally. \nOverall, the histological features are more consistent with an anaplastic \npleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (PXA) , in spite of the paucity of GFAP \nexpression, a feature that has been observed in some PXAs, particularly when \ntransformed into anaplastic tumors. The possibility of this tumor being a \ngliosarcorna has been considered; however the absence of a clear sarcomatous \npattern, microvascular cellular proliferation, and tumor necrosis does not \nsupport that diagnosis at this point. \nThe features in the biopsy may be correlated with clinical, imaging, and \n~oerative findings for their final interpretation and patient's follow up. \nPage 1  INTRA-OPERATIVE CONSULTATION \nA. \n\"Brain, right frontal lesion, biopsy\": \n1.

Brain, tight patietallobe, biopsy: Glioblastoma multiforme, grade IV (WHO); see \ncomment. \nCOM M ENT: This glioblastoma multiforme is composed of extremely pleomorphic, bizarre cells, which are \noften multinucleated. The cytoplasm is primarily densely eosinophilic, consistent with a gemistocytic \nphenotype. A high percentage of the cells stain strongly for GFAP. Focally, the tumor can be seen \ninfiltrating adjacent cortex. Mitoses, including abnormal mitotic figures, are easily identified. Microvascular \nproliferation is seen and focal necrosis is present. These features are diagnostic for glioblastoma \nmultiforme by the criteria. It is also a glioblastoma multiforme by the  criteria, and it is a grade \n4 astrocytoma by the  criteria. \nThe results of MIB-I staining will be reported by addendum. \nFSI parietal lobe, biopsy: Glioblastoma multiforme, grade IV . \nGross Description \nThe specimen is received in three parts, labeled with the patient's name and medical record number. \nPart A, received fresh and labeled \"right parietal brain tumor,\" consists of a piece of tan, soft tissue \nmeasuring 0.8 x 0.3 x 0.2 em in aggregate.

To cuts, there is loss of distinction between\ncortex and subcortical white matter due to irregular lesion, ill-defined, localized\npredominantly in the white matter, composed of brown tissue, something firm, with\nmultiple small cavities, sometimes blackened, giving a spongy.\nMicroscopy:\nHistological sections stained with H & E show infiltrative glial neoplasm, moderately\ncellular, affecting the cortex and white matter, and composed of a mixed population of\nglial cells. Most of these have round nuclei, dispersed chromatin and occasional\nperinuclear halos and is located in the middle of areas with loose fibrillar matrix, forming\nmicrocysts. Occasionally, we can observe some cells with eosinophilic and dense\ncytoplasm, with eccentric nuclei (\"minigemistocysts\"). Another type of cell is\ncharacterized by possessing more elongated nuclei with irregular outlines and dense\nchromatin arranged in a dense fibrillar matrix.

The malignant cells are characterized by \npleomorphic, anaplastic nuclei with dense, hyperchromatic chromatin \nand occasionally discernable nucleoli and variable amounts of eosinophilic, often spindled, cytoplasm. Many bizarre forms are present which appear as giant, multinucleated cells. In cytologic preparations, scattered cells show poorly-formed cells processes. \nNumerous abnormal mitotic figures are present. Although broad areas of necrosis are seen, significant endothelial changes are not identified. Many malignant cells display eosinophilic proteinaceous cyto~lasmic globules. Brown pigment deposition is also present.

Epidermal growth factor receptor variant III \n(EGFRvIII) is an oncogenic, constitutively active mutant form of EGFR that is \ncommonly expressed in glioblastoma. Cell culture and in vivo models of \nglioblastoma have demonstrated EGFRvIII as defining prognostically distinct \nsubgroups of glioblastomas. Additionally, the presence of EGFRvIII has been \nshown to sensitize tumors to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors when the tumor \nsuppressor protein PTEN is intact. RNA is extracted from formalin fixed, \nparaffin embedded tissue samples and reverse transcribed to cDNA. The cDNA is \nthen amplified using standard PCR technique for DNA templates. PCR products \nare detected by gel electrophoresis. The limit of detection of this assay has \nbeen determined to be approximately 5 mutant cells in 100 normal cells. \nFDA Comment: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a \nstand alone diagnostic test.

To~r~_ng performed on RNA extracted from paraffin tissue \nblock' \nThe epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an attractive molecular target \nin glioblastoma because it is amplified, overexpressed, and/or mutated in up \nto 40% to 50% of patients. Epidermal growth factor receptor variant III \n(EGFRvIII) is an oncogenic, constitutively active mutant form of EGFR that is \ncommonly expressed in glioblastoma. Cell culture and in vivo models of \nglioblastoma have demonstrated EGFRvIII as defining prognostically distinct \nsubgroups'of glioblastomas. Additionally, the presence of EGFRvIII has been \nshown to sensitize tumors to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors when the tumor \nsuppressor protein PTEN is intact. RNA is extracted from formalin fixed, \nparaffin embedded tissue samples and reverse transcribed to cDNA. The cDNA is \nthen amplified using standard PCR technique for DNA templates. PCR products \nare detected by gel electrophoresis. The limit of detection of this assay has \nbeen determined to be approximately 5 mutant cells in 100 normal cells. \nFDA Comment: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a \nstand alone diagnostic test.

The FISH interpretation summary indicates abnormalities in EGFR, 7 CEP, and 1p36 markers, suggesting a phenotypic appearance of oligoastrocytoma. However, the overall diagnosis remains Anaplastic Astrocytoma (WHO Grade III). The IHC antibody results support this diagnosis, with MGMT being positive in 40% of tumor cells and EGFR WT being positive in 80% of tumor cells. Additionally, IDH1 mutation testing revealed a nucleotide variant p.Arg49His (c.146G>A), but its significance is unclear. The MGMT promoter methylation test did not identify any methylation."

Brain, left frontal tumor, excision: Glioblastoma (WHO Grade IV) \n(see comment). \nCOMMENT Sections show a densely cellular tumor demonstrating vascular proliferation \nand necrosis. The tumor cells are diffusely positive for GFAP and p53. The \nKi-67 labeling index is variable, but is focally up to 60% in several areas. \nResults of MGMT promoter methylation and EGFRvIII mutation assays will be \nreported below in procedure addenda. \nPROCEDURES/ADDENDA \nPCR for EGFR \nDate Ordered: \nInterpretation Date Reported: \nPOSITIVE -EGFRvIII mutation is detected \nResults-Comments  TEST DESCRIPTION: Testing performed on RNA extracted from tumor paraffin \nblock \nThe epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an attractive molecular \ntarget \nin glioblastoma because it is amplified, overexpressed, and/or mutated in up \nto 40% to 50% of patients. Epidermal growth factor receptor variant III \n(EGFRvIII) is an oncogenic, constitutively active mutant form of EGFR that \nis \ncommonly expressed in glioblastoma. Cell culture and in vivo models of \nglioblastoma have demonstrated EGFRvIII as defining prognostically distinct \nsubgroups of glioblastomas. Additionally, the presence of EGFRvIII has been \nshown to sensitize tUmors to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors when the tumor \nsuppressor protein PTEN is intact. RNA is extracted from formalin fixed{ \nparaffin embedded tissue samples and reverse transcribed to cDNA. The cDNA \nis \nthen amplified using standard peR technique for DNA templates. peR products \nare detected by gel electrophoresis. The limit of detection of this assay \nhas \nbeen determined to be approximately 5 mutant cells in 100 normal cells. \nFDA Comment: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a \nstand alone diagnostic test.

The FDA has \ndetermined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These results \nare \nprovided for informational purposes only, and should be interpreted only in \nthe context of established procedures and/or diagnostic criteria. \nInterpretation \nNEGATIVE: No evidence of methylated MGMT promoter is detected. \nResults-Comments \nTesting performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block. \nTEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT promoter \nhave been shown to benefit from therapy with alkylating agents. Assessment \nof \nMGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite treatment of DNA \nfollov16d \nby real-time peR amplification (MethyLight) of methylated and unmethylated \nDNA \nsequences.  The analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by serial dilution of \nmethylated positive control DNA into unmethylated DNA, and was assessed to \nbe \n1% of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated DNA. Factors such as \nthe presence of >50% non-neoplastic cells in the sample, or extensive tissue \nnecrosis, may preclude the detection of methylated MGMT promoter sequences. \nFDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a \nstand alone diagnostic test.

Increased methylation of the MGMT gene promotor\nregion causes diminished or silenced expression of the gene, making cells\u2022more\nsensitive to DNA damage. This relationship has been shown for glioblastomas and\nalkylating agents such as temozolomide. Approximately 40-50% of glioblastomas\nexhibit MGMT gene methylation. Retrospective studies have shown that detection of\nMGMT promotor methylation in tumor samples is associated with an increased\nlikelihood of a favorable response to temozolomide.\nMethodology':\nDNA is isolated from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens.\nMolecular analysis of the MGMT gene is performed by methylation-specific PCR and\ndetected on AB17900. The MGMT and beta-Actin copy numbers are used to calculate\nthe ratio of MGMT/beta-Actin x1000. Molecular-based testing is highly accurate,\nbut as in any laboratory test, rare diagnostic errors may occur. Results of this\ntest are for Investigational Purposes Only.

Factors\nsuch as the presence of >50% non-neoplastic cells in the sample ,or extensive tissue necrosis, may\npreclude the\ndetection of methylated MGMT promoter sequences.\nFDA COMMENT :The above data are not to be construed as the results from a stand alone diagnostic\ntest. This test\nwas developed and its performance characteristics determined by the\nas required\nby CLIA '88 regulations. It has not been cleared or approved for specific uses by the U.S. Food and Drug\nAdministration (FDA). The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These\nresults are\nprovided for informational purposes only, and should be interpreted only in the context of established\nprocedures\nand/or diagnostic criteria.\n***Electronically Signed Out''\nLoss of Heterozygosity 1p, 19q Assay (LOH)\nDate Ordered: Date Reported:\nInterpretation\nNEGATIVE: Allelic loss on chromosome arm 1 p and chromosome arm 19q is NOT detected.\nInformative loci are: D1 S1592, D1 S552, D1 S1612, D19S219, D19S412 and PLA2G4C\nResults-Comments\nTesting performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block DNA extracted from a\ncorresponding blood specimen was used as a normal reference control.\nH and E slide was examined and no microdissection was needed.\nTEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA (baseline)/ Tumor DNA\npairs using 3\nmarkers at both 1 p and 19q. The 3 markers on 1 p are D1 S548, D1 S1592, and D1 S552 (with D1 S468,\nDl 51612, and\nD1 S496 as backup markers) and the 3 markers on 19q are D19S219, DI 95412, and PLA2G4C (with\nD19S606 and\nDI 9S1 182 as backup). All markers are microsatellites (2 or 4 nt repeats) except PLA2G4C which is a\nminisatellite (26\nnt repeat) polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score, amplicon size, and\nease of\ninterpretation. The backup markers are used if the first line markers at that chromosome arm are\nuninformative or\notherwise ambiguous in their interpretation. LOH at all informative loci on each chromosomal arm\nrepresents the\ntypical finding in oligodendrogliomas with I p and 1 9q deletion.\nFDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a stand-alone diagnostic\ntest.

MI between 4 and 16 is considered as\nlow level methylation and should be interpreted with caution since the\nsignificance of low level methylation in gliomas is not well understood. MI\ngreater than 16 is considered as methylated.\nBackground:\nMGMT (O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase) is a DNA repair enzyme\nthat is involved in the repair of damage caused by a variety of DNA\ncrosslinking compounds, including alkylating agents. Increased\nmethylation of the MGMT gene promoter region causes diminished or\nsilenced expression of the gene, making cells more sensitive to DNA\ndamage. This relationship has been shown for glioblastomas and\nalkylating agents such as Temodar(R)(temozolomide).\nApproximately 40% to 45% of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tumors\nexbi hi t MGMT gene methyl ati on - ^c hnrrn } t\ndetection of MGMT promoter methylation in tumor samples is associated\nwith an increased likelihood of a favorable response to temozolomide.\nMethodology:\nDNA is isolated from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE)\nspecimen. Molecular analysis of the MGMT gene is performed by\nmethylation-specific PCR. Molecular-based testing is highly accurate but\nas in any laboratory test, rare diagnostic errors may occur.\nResults of this test are for Investigational Purposes Only. The\nperformance characteristic of this assay have been determined by\nThe result should not be used as a diagnostic procedure\nwithout confirmation of the diagnosis by another medically\nestablished diagnostic product or procedure.\nReferences:\n1.Vlassenbroeck I. et al.

The \nneoplastic cells have anaplastic elongated nuclei disposed in a heavy \nfibrillary background. There are occasional mitotic figures. There is \ncapillary-type microvasculature with interanastomosing vessels, and \nfocally there is microvascular cellular proliferation. There is no \nnecrosis. \nSPECIAL STAINS: Immunoperoxidase methods for GFAP and MIB-1 were \nperformed on sections from blocks #2 and x3. \nThe GFAP demonstrates the glial fibrillary background of the \ntumor.

In here, microvascular calcification and a \nmicrovascular network of vessels is more prominent. In a couple of \nmicroscopic areas there is tumor necrosis associated with \nmicrovascular \ncellular proliferation. \nThe presence of microscopic zones of necrosis would justify the \ndesignation of this tumor as glioblastoma multiforme.

MIB-1 LABELLING INDEX 37%.\nSEE MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION AND COMMENT.\n------------------------------------------------------------\nOperation/Specimen: Craniotomy, temporal lobe.\nClinical History and Pre-Op Dx:year old man with right temporal\nlobe tumor.\nGROSS PATHOLOGY: Received fresh, two fragments, 1.1 cm. across, in\naggregate. Soft, focally hemorrhagic and glistening. In total #1 and\n2.\nINTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION: Brain, right temporal: Glioma, high\nhistological grade.\nAskB.\nSPECIMEN: Right temporal tumor - permanent.\nFIXATIVE: Saline.\nGENERAL: A 2.0 x 1.8 x 0.2 cm. aggregate of numerous, fragmented\ntan-red soft tissue fragments and scanty blood clot.\nSECTIONS: Xl,X2 - all submitted.\nMICROSCOPIC: A. Portions of cerebrum effaced by a neoplastic\nproliferation of glial cells. The neoplasm is very cellular and made\nup of round or ovoid neoplastic nuclei with anaplastic features. The\nbackground is fibrillary and has prominent microvascular cellular\nproliferation. Mitotic figures are very frequent. There is individual\ncell necrosis and areas of geographic tumor necrosis. At the periphery\nof the tumor, neoplastic cells have perinuclear halos suggestive of an\noligodendroglial nature.\nB. Portions of brain with a neoplasm similar to that one described for\npart A. However, in this specimen there are zones of clearly\nidentifiable anaplastic oligodendroglioma, and extensive areas of\nnecrosis.\nSPECIAL STAINS: Immunoperoxidase methods for GFAP and MIB-1 were\nperformed on block #2. The GFAP demonstrates a moderately fibrillary\nbackground, and highlights the prominent microvascular cellular\nproliferation. With the MIB-1 a labelling index of 37% is determined.\nCOMMENT: In this material there is a high histological grade glioma\nthat in less anaplastic areas has an oligodendroglial phenotype . The\nneoplasm has prominent nuclear anaplasia, mitotic activity,\nmicrovascular cellular proliferation, and areas of tumor necrosis,\nnamely a WHO grade IV/IV glioma. This tumor may also be diagnosed as a\nglioblastoma multiforme with an oligodendroglial component. The\nproliferation index is 37%.

Although \nthere is \nnot overt microvascular cellular proliferation and/or tumor necrosis1 \nthe \nneoplasm's high cellularity1 brisk mitotic activity and elevated MIB-1 \nproliferation index portend an aggressive behavior1 probably more akin \nto a \nglioblastoma than to an anaplastic astrocytoma. \n The morphological features may be correlated with clinical1 imaging \nand \nOperative fi~dings and molecular testing results for their final \ninterpretation and patient's follow up. \nPROCEDURES/ADDENDA \nPCR f.or EGFR variant III \nDate Ordered\u2022  \nInterpretation \nNEGATIVE -No evidence of \nResults-Comments mutation \nDate Reported:  \nEGFRviii mutati.on is detected \nTEST DESCRIPTION: Testing performed on RNA extracted from tumor \nparaffin block \nThe epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR} is an attractive molecular \ntarget \nin glioblastoma because it is amplified1 overexpressed1 and/or mutated \nin up \nto 40% to 50~ of patients.

The FDA has \ndetermined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These results are \nprovided for informational purposes only! and should be interpreted only in \nthe context of established procedures and/or diagnostic criteria. \nInterpretation \nNEGATIVE: Allelic loss on chromosome arm 1p is NOT detected. \nThere is loss of heterozygosity in only one of the markers (PLA2G4C) on \nchromosome arm 19q suggestive of partial deletion. \nInformative loci are: \n0181592, 018468, 018496 \n0198412, PLA2G4C, 0198606, 01981182 \nResults-Comments \nTE8T DE8CRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA \n(baseline)/ Tumor DNA pairs using 3 markers at both 1p and 19q. The 3 markers \non 1p are 018548, D181592, and 018552 (with 018468, 0181612, and D18496 as \nbackup markers) and the 3 markers on 19q are D198219, D198412, and PLA2G4C \n(with 0198606 and 01981182 as backup). All markers are microsatellites (2 or 4 \nnt repeats) except PLA2G4C which is a minisatellite (26 nt repeat) \npolymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score, \namplicon size, and ease of interpretation. The backup markers are used if the \nfirst line markers at that chromosome arm are uninformative or otherwise \nambiguous in their interpretation. LOR at all informative loci on each \nchromosomal arm represents the typical finding in oligodendrogliomas with 1p and 19q deletion. \nFDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a \nstand-alone diagnostic test.

Approximately 10% of neoplastic cells overexpress p53 protein, which is associated with more aggressive behavior. Additionally, the MIB-1 proliferation index ranges between 6% and 30%, indicating high cellular turnover in some areas. Although stage information is not provided, these features suggest a high-grade astrocytic tumor that exhibits malignant behavior by invading surrounding tissue."

The presence of subarachnoid accumulations of tumor cells in part B supports this diagnosis. Additionally, FISH analysis showed 2 out of 4 abnormal markers and 9p21 loss, which are associated with a lower hazard of short survival. Immunohistochemical labeling confirmed the diagnosis, with high proliferation index and PTEN loss being consistent with anaplastic astrocytoma."

Focally there is an arciform \ncapillary-type vascular network and very sparse microcalcification. \nThe neoplasm has histological features of glioblastoma.

Epidermal growth factor receptor variant III \n(EGFRvIII) is an oncogenic, constitutively active mutant form of EGFR that is \ncommonly expressed in glioblastoma. Cell culture and in vivo models of \nglioblastoma have demonstrated EGFRvIII as defining prognostically distinct \nsubgroups of glioblastomas. Additionally, the presence of EGFRvIll has been \nsh0\\1n to sensitize tumors to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors when the tumor \nsuppressor protein PTEN is intact. RNA is extracted from formalin fixed, \nparaffin embedded tissue samples and reverse transcribed to cDNA. The cDNA is \nthen amplified using standard PCR technique for DNA templates. PCR products \n~re detected by gel electrophoresis. The limit of detection of this assay has \nlen determined to be approximately 5 mutant cells in 100 normal cells. \nFDA Comment: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a \nstand alone diagnostic test.

B. Brain, right frontal tumor, excision biopsy: Anaplastic \noligoastrocytoma (WHO Grade III) (see cormnent). \nCOMMENT \nPermanent sections confirm the frozen section diagnosis, with the \nexception of \nthe tumor grade. The sections show a moderately cellular infiltrative \nneoplasm. Mucin-filled microcystic spaces are seen focally. The tumor \ncells \nmostly show oval to round nuclei, however some irregular and angulated \nforms \nare present. Numerous mini-gemistocytes and some astrocytic \ngemistocytes ~re \npre~ent. Mild to moderate nuclear pleomorphism is seen, \\\u2022lith a mitotic \ncount \nof up to 2 to 3 per ten HPFs in areas of dense cellularity. Frequent \napoptotic \nbodies are noted. No definite microvascular proliferation or areas of \nnecrosis \nare seen. p53 shows moderate positivity in 50% of the tumor cells, \n\\<Ihereas EMA \nis mostly negative. The Ki-67 labeling index is focally increased to \napproximately 15~. \nPositive and negative controls show appropriate immunoreactivity. \nMGMT promoter methylation is detected, and complete LOH for 1p/19q is \nnot \ndetected (see procedure addenda beloc1) . \n The tumor shows mixed oligodendroglial/astrocytic cytology, but \nappears \nprimarily ol~godendroglial. \n======================================================================= \nPRO~EDURES/ADDENDA \nMGMT Promoter Methylation \nDate Ordered,.  Date Reported: \nPOSITIVE: Methylated MGMT promoter is detected. \nResults-Comments  \nTesting performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block \nH stained slide was examined by a pathologist for \nsubsequent tumor \ndissection. Sufficient tumor cells were present in the tissue block \nand .-no \nmicrodissection was needed. \nTEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT \npromoter \nhave been shown to benefit from therapy with alkylating agents. \nAssessment of \nMGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite treatment of DNA \nfollowed \nby real-time PCR amplification (MethyLight) of methylated and \nunmethylated DNA \nsequences. The analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by \nserial \ndilution of methylated positive control DNA into unmethylated DNA, and \nwas \nassessed to be 1~ of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated \nDNA. \nFactors such~\u00b7as. the presence of >50% non-neoplastic cells in the \nsample1 or \n~xtensive tissue necrosis1 may preclude the detection of methylated \nMGMT \npromoter sequences. \nFDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results \nfrom a \nstand alone diagnostic test.

Mitotic figures are\nfound with\ngreat difficulty, and there is not microvascular proliferation or tumor necrosis. The MIB-1 proliferation\nindex is greater\nthan 9% (as normal native cells are entered in the total nuclear count; the index is probably no more than\n15%).\nThe findings are interpreted as those of a low histological grade glial neoplasm that has molecular\nfeatures of\nastrocytoma. The elevated cycling activity may portend a heightened aggressive potential.\nPart B.\nSurgical PathologyPage 2 of 4\nThis specimen is three small fragments of cerebral cortex in which, because of the small size and\norientation of the\nfragments, it is difficult to evaluate the cortical architectural features. Furthermore, the IDH1 stain\ndemonstrates a9goc13 somewhat sparse sprinkling of the cortex by neoplastic glial cells, which interferes even more with\nevaluation of the\ndistribution of normal cells. There is not obvious architectural distortion, dysmorphic neuronal element, or\nballoon\ncells.\nThe findings are interpreted as a glial neoplasm sparsely infiltrating the cerebral cortex; and non\nconclusive of cortical\ndysplasia\nThe features in both specimens may be correlated with clinical, imaging, electrophysiological, and\noperative findings\nfor their interpretation and patient's follow up.\n***Electronically Signed Out***\nSenior Staff Pathologist\nConsultant: Senior Staff Pathologist\nProcedures /Addenda\nLoss of Heterozygosity 1 p, 19q Assay (LOH)\nDate Ordered: Date Reported:\nInterpretation\nNEGATIVE: Allelic loss on chromosome arm 1 p and chromosome arm 19q is NOT detected.\nInformative loci are: D1S1592, D1S552, D19S412, D19S606, D19S1182 and PLA2G4C\nResults -Comments\nTesting performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block (Al). DNA extracted from a\ncorresponding blood specimen was used as a normal reference control.\nH and E slide was examined and no microdissection was needed.\nTEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA (baseline )/ Tumor DNA\npairs using 3\nmarkers at both 1 p and 19q. The 3 markers on 1 p are DI S548, D1 S1592, and D1 S552 (with D1 S468,\nD1S1612, and\nD1 S496 as backup markers) and the 3 markers on 19q are D19S219, D19S412, and PLA2G4C (with\nD19S606 and\nD19S1182 as backup). All markers are microsatellites (2 or 4 nt repeats )except PLA2G4C which is a\nminisatellite (26\nnt repeat) polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score, amplicon size, and\nease of\ninterpretation. The backup markers are used if the first line markers at that chromosome arm are\nuninformative or\notherwise ambiguous in their interpretation.

Portions of cerebral and subjacent white matter extensively \ninfiltrated by glial neoplasm with predominantly round, but also \nelongated nuclei in a fine fibrillary background. \nC. Portions of white matter infiltrated by predominantly naked, \nelongated neoplastic nuclei. \nD. Portions of a moderate-to-highly cellular glial neoplasm with \nprominent nuclear pleomorphism and made up of cells with gemistocytic \nfeatures in a prominent fibrillary background. Interspersed between \nthe gemistocytics, there are numerous anaplastic looking naked nuclei. \nMitotic figures and occasional individual cells necrosis are observed. \nThere are no areas of necrosis or vascular endothelial proliferation. \nE. Portions of glial neoplasm with cellular features similar to those \ndescribed for part D.

There are \nno areas of necrosis and vascular endothelial microcellular \nproliferation are not observed. \nSPECIAL STAINS: Immunoperoxidase stain for GFAP and MIB-1 antigens \nwere performed on block #5. The GFAP demonstrates the macro and mini \ngemistocytic phenotype of the tumor cells. With the MIB-1a labelling \nindex of about 2% is determined. \nCOMMENT: The neoplasm is a glioma with features of anaplasia. There \nare focal areas of anaplastic gernistocytic astrocytoma; in other \nsmaller focal areas, the neoplasm has features of anaplastic \noligodendroglioma interspersed with neoplastic astrocytes (hybrid \ntumor).

Tumors with IDH1 or\nIDH2 mutations\nhave distinctive genetic and clinical characteristics, and patients with such tumors have a better outcome\nthan those\nwith wild type IDH genes.\nMutations in IDH1/ 2 are detected by DNA sequencing procedures. The limit of detection of standard\nbidirectional\nsequencing is approximately 20-25%. In order to increase assay sensitivity tumor enrichment must be\nperformed by\nmanual microdissection when tumor cells in the block constitute less than 50 % of nucleated cells.\nFDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a stand alone diagnostic\ntest.

Epidermal growth factor receptor variant \nIII\u00b7 \n(EGFRvIII) is an oncogenic, constitutively active mutant form of EGFR \nthat is \ncommonly expressed in glioblastoma. Cell culture and in vivo models of \nglioblastoma have demonstrated EGFRvIII as defining prognostically \ndistinct \nsubgroups of glioblastomas. Additionally, the presence of EGFRvIII has \nbeen \nshown to sensitize tumors to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors when the \ntumor \nsuppressor protein PTEN is intact. RNA is extracted from formalin \nfixed, \nparaffin embedded tissue samples and reverse transcribed to cDNA. The \ncDNA is \nthen amplified using standard PCR technique for DNA templates. PCR \nproducts \nare detected by gel electrophoresis. The limit of detection of this \nassay has \nbeen determined to be approximately 5 mutant cells in 100 normal \ncells.

On imaging there is a left frontal lobe-centered \nenhancing mass \nthat extends into the corpus callosum. There are also several \nenhancing \nsatellite lesions. MRS demonstrates increased levels of choline, \ndecreased \nNAA, and no lipid or lactate spikes. \nOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES \nLeft brain tumor \nOperation/Specimen: A: Brain tumor, biopsy \nPATHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS: \nA. Brain, site not specified, excisional biopsies: \n1. Glioblastoma \n2. MIB-l proliferation index: 20%. \nSee Microscopy Description and Comment. \nCOMMENT \nThe sections contain portions of an astrocytic neoplastic \nproliferation that \nhas nuclear anaplasia, mitotic activity, and sparse microvascular \ncellular \nproliferation with necrosis and rnicrothrombosis. There are frequent \ngiant \ncells, several of them multinucleated and bizarre. Some of the giant \ncells \nand smaller cells are immunoreactive with neuronal markers. The MIB-l \nproliferation index is high at about 20% in the more active areas. \nThe findings are interpreted as those of a glioblastoma (WHO IV) with \nprobably \na neuronal component, which may portend a less grave prognosis.  PROCEDURES/ADDENDA \nPCR for EGFR variant III \nDate Ordered: 1IIIIIIII \nInterpretation mutation \nDate Reported: \nNEGATIVE -No evidence of EGFRvIII mutation is detected \nResults-Comments \nTEST DESCRIPTION: Testing performed on RNA extracted from paraffin \nblock \nH slide was examined and no microdissection was \nneeded. \nThe epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an attractive molecular \ntarget \nin glioblastoma because it is amplified, overexpressed t and/or mutated \nin up \nto 40% to 50% of patients. Epidermal growth factor receptor variant \nIII \n(EGFRvIII) is an oncogenic, constitutively active mutant form of EGFR \nthat is \ncommonly expressed in glioblastoma. Cell culture and in vivo models of \nglioblastoma have demonstrated EGFRvIII as defining prognostically \ndistinct \nsubgroups of glioblastomas. Additionally, the presence of EGFRvIII has \nbeen \nshown to sensitize tumors to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors when the \ntumor \nsuppressor protein PTEN is intact. RNA is extracted from formalin \nfixed, \nparaffin embedded tissue samples and reverse transcribed to eDNA. The \ncDNA is \nthen amplified using standard PCR technique for DNA templates. PCR \nproducts \nare detected by gel electrophoresis. The limit of detection of this \nassay has \nbeen determined to be approximately 5 mutant cells in 100 normal \ncells. \nFDA Comment: The above data are not to be construed as the results \nfrom a \nstand alone diagnostic test. This test was dev~loped and its \nperformance \ncharacteristics d~mined by the \nrequired by CLIA 'III regulations. \nfor laboratory as \nor approved  specific uses by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA \nhas \ndetermined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These \nresults are \nprovided for informational purposes only, and should be interpreted \nonly in \nthe context of established procedures and/or diagnostic criteria. \nInterpretation \nNEGATIVE: No evidence of methylated MGMT promoter is detected. \nResults-Comments \nTesting performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block \nH slide was examined and no microdissection was \nneeded. \nTEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT \npromoter \nhave been shown to benefit from therapy with alkylating agents. \nAssessment of \nMGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite treatment of DNA \nfollowed \nby real-time PCR amplification (MethyLight) of methylated and \nunmethylated DNA \nsequences. The analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by \nserial \ndilution of methylated positive control DNA into unmethylated DNA, and \nwas \nassessed to be 1% of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated \nDNA. \nFactors such as the presence of >50% non-neoplastic cells in the \nsample, or \nextensive tissue necrosis, may preclude the detection of methylated \nMGMT \npromoter sequences. \nFDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results \nfrom a \nstand alone diagnostic test.

Right parietal primary tumor: GLIAL NEOPLASM WITH OLIGODENDROCYTIC \nFEATURES AND ELEVATED PROLIFERATION INDEX, SEE MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION, \nSEE NOTE \n2. Right parietal: GLIAL NEOPLASM WITH OLIGODENDROCYTIC FEATURES AND \nELEVATED PROLIFERATION INDEX, SEE MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION, SEE NOTE \nComment: \nWhile many of areas of this tumor demonstrate features of an \noligodendroglioma, there is no area demonstrating the classic tightly \npacked, honeycomb-like architecture of an oligodendroglioma with \nnumerous perinuclear halos. In addition, perinuclear halos are \nrelatively rare in this tumor. This may be due to the fact that all of \nthe tissue was frozen and therefore the classic morphology may have \nbeen disrupted. As a result, a definitive diagnosis of \noligodendroglioma cannot be made reliably. If this tumor were an \nastrocytoma, the presence of mitoses would require a diagnosis of an \nanaplastic astrocytoma, grade Ill (WHO scale). However, if this were \nan oligodendroglioma, the presence of mitoses would lead to a diagnosis \nof oligodendroglioma, grade II (WHO scale). In any case, the \nproliferation index is relatively high for a grade II \noligodendroglioma. In fact, oligodendrogliomas with proliferation \nindices of greater than 5% are associated with a significantly poorer \nprognosis than those with proliferation indices less than 5% (1 ). \nTherefore, regardless of lineage, this tumor is likely to behave more \naggressively than a typical grade II oligodendroglioma. Genetic \nanalysis for the 1 p, 1 9q deletion seen in many prognostically favorable \noligodendroglia! tumors is pending and when completed, a separate \nreport will be issued. \n1.  \n \n   \n  \nThis diagnostic report has been personally interpreted by the signatory \nof record. \nMicroscopic Description: \nThe tumor consists of an infiltrative and moderately pleomorphic \nproliferation of glial cells with relatively round nuclei. In some \nareas, there are perinuclear halos. There is a fine capillary network \nthat in some areas displays a chicken-wire pattern. Scattered mitoses \nare present, however, there is no endothelial proliferation or \nnecrosis. Immunohistochemistry for the proliferation antigen Ki67 was \nperformed as follows: Nine 250 x 250 micron fields were counted and the \npercentage of labeled nuclei determined. More than 1 ,000 cells were \n\":ounted. The proliferation index ranged from 1 0.5% to 18.4% with an \noverall average of 13.6%. \nFrozen Section Diagnosis: \n1.

GFAP is positive in neoplastic cells with astrocytic morphology. p53 protein is overexpressed in the \nmajority of tumor cells. MIB-llabeling index is moderate. The findings support the above diagnosis. \nADDENDA: \n1 p and 19q FISH studies were performed on cells within paraffin sections from tumor. Two hybridizations were \nperformed: one with a 19q probe/control 19p pair and one with a 1p probe/control1q pair. The 19q and 1p probes \nmapped to the regions that are commonly deleted in gliomas. The 19q to 19p probe ratio was 1.00. The 1p to lq \nprobe ratio was 1.02. For both probes, the normal ratio is approximately 1. Any ratio less than 0.80 is consistent \nwith deletion of the chromosomal region of interest. \nThere was no evidence of deletion of lp or 19q.

Epidermal growth factor receptor variant \nIII \n(EGFRvIII) is an oncogenic, constitutively active mutant form of EGFR \nthat is \ncommonly expressed in glioblastoma. Cell culture and in vivo models of \nglioblastoma have demonstrated EGFRvIII as defining p'rognostically \ndistinct \nsubgroups of glioblastomas. Additionally, the presence of EGFRvIII has \nbeen \nshown to sensitize tumors to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors when the \ntumor \nsuppressor protein PTEN is intact. RNA is extracted from formalin \nfixed, \nparaffin embedded tissue samples and reverse transcribed to eDNA. The \ncDNA is \nthen amplified using standard PCR technique for DNA templates.

In addition, the GFAP and\nneurofilament immunohistochemistry stain demonstrates in addition to relatively solid\nareas, the tumor does diffusely infiltrate the gray and white matter. The neoplastic cells\nare immunoreactive for P53. In most areas, the tumor is infiltrative with NeuN positivity\namong the tumor cells is not specific. In the most solid area of the tumor, there is a\nsuggestion of weak NeuN positivity within the tumor cells but this positivity is much\nweaker than the surrounding neurons. The reticulin stain does not demonstrate\ninvestment of individual cells. Overall, the findings are suggestive of a diffusely\ninfiltrative glioma. In the solid areas of tumor, scattered MIB-1 reactive cells are present\nwith an estimated labeling index of 3-5%, consistent with a low grade process.\nAddendum Diagnosis:\nDiffuse well-differentiated Astrocytoma (WHO grade II).\nMicroscopic Description:\nSections demonstrate fragments of gray and white brain matter. A focus of markedly\nincreased cellularity is identified. Cells within this areaappear to be glial in origin. They\nare mainly small with round to ovoid nuclei .Few of the cells are larger and demonstrate\nprominent nucleoli .Mitotic figures are not seen.

MI between 4 and 16 is considered as\nlow level methylation and should be interpreted with caution since the\nsignificance of low level methylation in gliomas is not well understood. MI\ngreater than 16 is considered as methylated.\nBackground:\nMGMT (0 (6) -methyl guanine -DNA methyltransferase) is a DNA repair enzyme\nthat is involved in the repair of damage caused by a variety of DNA\ncrosslinking compounds, including alkylating agents. Increased\nmethylation of the MGMT gene promoter region causes diminished or\nsilenced expression of the gene, making cells more sensitive to DNA\ndamage. This relationship has been shown for glioblastomas and\nalkylating agents such as Temodar(R)(temozolomide).\nApproximately 40% to 45% of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tumors\nexhibit MGMT gene methylation. Retrospective studies have shown that\ndetection of MGMT promoter methylation in tumor samples is associated\nwith an increased likelihood of a favorable response to temozolomide.\nMethodology:\nDNA is isolated from formalin-'fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE)\nspecimen. Molecular analysis of the MGMT gene is performed by\nmethylation-specific PCR. Molecular-based testing is highly accurate but\nas in any laboratory test, rare diagnostic errors may occur.\nResults of this test are for Investigational Purposes Only.

Representative sections submitted in \ncassettes 7-10. \n   \nMICROSCOPIC: \nA and B. Both specimens reveal an aplastic proliferation of \noligodendrocytes with different degrees of cellularity and cytological \n atypia. In some areas, the tumor is well differentiated and the \nneoplastic cells display well defined cell borders and typical peri\u00ad\nnuclear halos. In these areas, the cellularity is low and there is no \nsignificant mitotic activity. However, most of the tumor consists of \nareas of higher cellularity, with more pronounced nuclear pleomorphism \nand readily identified mitotic figures. The stromal vessels in these \nareas display endothelial hyperplasia. Except for one area present in \nthe frozen section control slide, there are no extensive foci of \nnecrosis. The tumor infiltrates the cortex in many areas and reveals \nneoplastic satellitosis around non-neoplastic cortical neurons. There \nis also evidence of previous hemorrhage within the tumor and numerous \ninterstitial calcifications are also present. In some areas, the \ntumor \ncompletely replaces the entire gyri and produces subpial aggregates on \nadjacent gyri. \nIn summary, the findings are those of an anaplastic oligodendroglioma. \nThe grade in the tumor is anaplastic as based on the high degree of \ncellularity, nuclear pleomorphism and mitotic activity in several \nareas \nof the tumor. In the Smith Grading System for oligodendrogliomas, \nthese areas of anaplasia would received a Grade C-D.

The tumor has focal microvascular\nproliferation,\nbut is devoid of tumor necrosis. There are also zones of sparse cellularity with microcalcifications.\nThe neoplasm is a cellular oligodendroglioma with 1 p, 19q LOH codeletion, positive IDH 1, a modest\nmitotic rate,\npositive MGMT, and a high proliferation index. The biopsy is somewhat small, contains tumor at the low\nend of\nanaplastic transformation, and is probably not representative of the anaplastic regions depicted on the\nimaging\nstudies\nThe morphological features in this sample may be correlated with clinical, imaging, and operative findings\nfor their\ninterpretation and patient's follow up.\n***Electronically Signed Out***\nM.D., Senior Staff Pathologist\nSurgical Pathology\nPage 2 of 3\nConsultant:.\nProcedures /Addenda\nMGMT Promoter MethylationMD, Senior Staff Pathologist Date Ordered : Date Reported:\nInterpretation\nPOSITIVE: Methylated MGMT promoter is detected.\nResults-Comments\nTesting performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block (Al).\nH and E slide was examined and no microdissection was needed.\nTEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT promoter have been shown to\nbenefit\nfrom therapy with alkylating agents. Assessment of MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite\ntreatment of\nDNA followed by real-time PCR amplification of methylated and unmethylated DNA\nsequences. The\nanalytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by serial dilution of methylated positive control DNA into\nunmethylated DNA, and was assessed to be 1 % of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated\nDNA. Factors\nsuch as the presence of >50% non-neoplastic cells in the sample, or extensive tissue necrosis, may\npreclude the\ndetection of methylated MGMT promoter sequences.\nFDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a stand alone diagnostic\ntest. This test\nwas developed and its performance characteristics determined by the\nas required\nby CLIA '88 regulations.

Histologic correlation is necessary.\nH and E slide was examined and no microdissection was needed.\nTEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA ( baseline )/ Tumor DNA\npairs using 3\nmarkers at both 1 p and 19q. The 3 markers on 1 p are D1 S548, D1 S1592, and D1 S552 (with D1 S468,\nD1S1612, and\nD1S496 as backup markers) and the 3 markers on 19q are D19S219, D19S412, and PLA2G4C (with\nD19S606 and\nD19S1182 as backup). All markers are microsatellites (2 or 4 nt repeats) except PLA2G4C which is a\nminisatellite (26\nSurgical Pathology\nPage 3 of 3\nnt repeat) polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score, amplicon size, and\nease of\ninterpretation. The backup markers are used if the first line markers at that chromosome arm are\nuninformative or otherwise ambiguous in their interpretation. LOH at all informative loci on each chromosomal arm\nrepresents the\ntypical finding in oligodendrogliomas with 1 p and 19q deletion.\nFDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a stand-alone diagnostic\ntest.

It was recently shown that the co-deletion of 1 p and 19q is mediated by an\nunbalanced translocation t(1;19)(gl 0;p10) 2. Loss of 1 p and 19q has been used as a diagnostic as well as prognostic\nmarker of oligodendroglial tumors. Recent literature 2,3 suggests that oligodendrogliomas with loss of 1 p and 19q are\nlikely more responsive to chemotherapeutic drugs/ radiation therapy, and such tumors may represent a \"favorable\"\nform of oligodendrogliomas.\nMethod :The 1 p36/ 1 q25 and 19q / 19p13 were applied to the provided paraff in-embedded tissue\nsections. This probe set contains 1 p36 and 1 q25 in one vial. The other\nset/vial contains 19q13 and 19pl3 The probe sets were applied\nindividually to treated tissue sections and then sections were viewed and interphase nuclei were examined for\ncorresponding signals.\nPage 2of3 Surgical Pathology Report\nDisclaimer :This test was develooed and its performance characteristics determined by the\nIthas not been cleared or approved by the US Food and Drug\nAdministration.

TP53 mutations are more often found in astrocytic tumors and\ncorrelate with a worse prognosis. Additional information can be found in\nMcLendon et al. Cancer. 2005; 104:1693-9 and references within. Clinicians\nshould correlate these results with clinical and other laboratory findings.\nThe sensitivity of DNA sequencing is 99% for the detection of nucleotide base\nchanges, small deletions, and insertions in the regions analyzed. However,\nthis assay may not detect an acquired mutation which is present below the 25%\ndetection limit (i.e., mutant cell population of < 25%). Only the coding\nregions of the TP53 gene and immediate flanking intronic sequences were\nexamined. Changes in the promoter region, farther into the introns, or in\nother non-coding regions of the gene would not be detected. Mutations in genes\nother than TP53 would not be identified. Large deletions, duplications,\nmultiple exon insertions, sequence alterations adversely affecting primer\nbinding, and complete deletion of one allele may not be identified using these\nmethods.

Pale white, oval brain tissue fragment, 5 x 4 em in size. \nThe meningeal surface has tan-brown, sulci and gyri, the \nresected surface has varigated papillary appearance. Serial \nsectioning reveals relatively normal appearing cortex, the \ncerebral white matter shows fine punctate markings. \n2-5,\u00b7 representative. \nBrain tumor. \nFormalin. Four irregular, tan-white, soft tissue fragments, 3-5 rom in \ndimension. \nMICROSCOPIC: A. Portions of cerebral cortex with moderately increased \ncellularity due to the presence of small round and elongated \nhyperchromatic nuclei. Around vessels there are accumUlations of these \nnuclei cuffing the vessels. In these zones the neoplastic cells have a \ndefinite astrocytic phenotype. There are no mitoses, microvascular \nPage 1  cellular proliferation or necrosis. \nB. Portions of cerebral cortex and adjacent white matter\u00b7~ and \nleptomeninges. The white matter contains a neoplastic proliferation of \nglial cells similar to the ones described for part A. The neoplastic \nnuclei are round or elongated, have moderate pleomorphism, and \ninfiltrate the cerebral cortex. Around vessels, the neoplastic cells \nform nests of prominently fibrillary astrocytes. In the cerebral \ncortex at the pial-glial interface they accumulate focally. A couple \nof nests of neoplastic cells are observed in the leptomeningeal space. \nThere are no mitoses, microvascular cellular proliferation, or areas of \nnecrosis. The neoplasm is present in the deeper margin of the white \nmatter throughout the specimen. \nC. Portions of cerebral cortex and adjacent white matter. The tissue \nis infiltrated by a glial neoplasm similar to that one described for \nparts A and B. In this specimen, however, there is a focal area of \nsolid neoplasm, which is more cellular and contains proliferative \nmdcrovessels. A couple of these microvessels have microvascular \ncellular proliferation, and one microvessel has undergone necrosis and \nthrombosis, and the immediately surrounding tumor tissue is undergoing \nnecrosis with pseudopalading. One mitotic figure is identified. \nSPECIAL STAINS: Immunoperoxidase stains for GFAP and MIBI are \nperformed on blocks 2 and 6. \nThe IIIIIdemonstrates the strong fibrillary component of the tumor \ncells around vessels (#2), and in solid tumor (#6). With the MIB-l \nproliferation indices of 1.5% and 9% are determined in specimen Band \nC, respectively. \nCOMMENT: In parts A and B (right temporal lobe) there is a diffusely \ninfiltrating glioma involving white and gray matter. The neoplasm has \nmoderate. nuclear atypia, is devoid of mitotic figures, microvascular \ncellular proliferation, and/or necrosis, and particularly in \nperivascular areas has a well defined astrocytic phenotype. This \nneoplasm has a MIB-l proliferation index of 1.5%. A couple \nof small fragments of similar neoplasm is observed in the \nleptomeningeal space. These are features of a histologically low grade \n(WHO grade II/IV) astrocytoma. In specimen C there is a similar \nneoplasm. However, in here there is a zone of solid tumor in which \ncellularity ;.s prominent, a couple of microvessels have microvasculnr \nuellular proiiferation, one microvessel has undergone necrosis and lS \nsurrounded by a microscopic zone of tumor necrosis, and one mitotic \nfigure is observed. The MIB-1 proliferation index in this specimen is \n9%. These morphological findings are those of a high \nhistological grade glioma, possibly a glioblastoma multiforme. The \nspecimen is small, and may not be representative of the entire lesion. \nThe morphological findings may be correlated with clinical, imaging, \nand intraoperative findings for final determination. \nPage 2 ",

Tumor DNA\npairs using 3 markers at both 1 p and 19q. The 3 markers on 1 p are D1 S548, DI S1592, and D1 S552 (with D1 S468,\nD1 S1612, and\nD1 S496 as backup markers) and the 3 markers on 19q are D19S219, D19S412, and PLA2G4C (with\nD1 9S606 and\nD19S1182 as backup). All markers are microsatellites (2 or 4 nt repeats) except PLA2G4C which is a\nminisatellite (26\nnt repeat) polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score, amplicon size, and\nease of\ninterpretation. The backup markers are used if the first line markers at that chromosome arm are\nuninformative or\notherwise ambiguous in their interpretation. LOH at all informative loci on each chromosomal arm\nrepresents the\ntypical finding in oligodendrogliomas with 1 p and 19q deletion.\nFDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a stand-alone diagnostic\ntest.

All markers are microsatellites \n(2 or 4 \nnt repeats) except PLA2G4C which is a minisatellite (26 nt repeat) \npolymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score, \namplicon size, and ease of interpretation.

Right frontal tumor, resection: High-grade mixed glioma (see \ncomment) . \nB. Corpus callosum, resection: Cerebral cortex, no evidence of \ntumor. \nCOMMENT \nSections show a classic appearing oligodendroglial neoplasm centered \nin the \ndeep white matter. Mitotic figures are readily identified. The deeper, \npossibly intraventricular portions of the tumor show a papillary \nstructure \nwith astroblastoma type cells forming perivascular rosettes, best seen \nby GFAP \nimmunostain. There are also areas of astrogliosis, vascular \nproliferation and \nhyalinized necrosis however these show features suggesting that they \nare \nreactive to prior treatment, e.g., radiation. \nThe tumor is diffusely weak to moderately p53 positive and the Ki-67 \nlabeling \nindex is focally up to approximately 30%. \nGiven the presence of the astroblastoma-like component, and that the \nprevious \nresection from this patient was interpreted as an astrocytoma, the \ntumor may \nperhaps best be considered a high-grade mixed glioma.

The 3 \nmarkers \non 1p are D1S548, D1S1592, and D1S552 (with D1S468, 0181612, and \n018496 as \nbackup markers) and the 3 markers on 19q are D19S219, D19S412, and \nPLA2G4C \n(with D19S606 and D19S1182 as backup). All markers are microsatellites \n(2 or 4 \nnt repeats) except PLA2G4C which is a minisatellite (26 nt repeat) \npolymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score, \namplicon size, and ease of interpretation. The backup markers are used \nif the \nfirst line markers at that chromosome arm are uninformative or \nother\\'llse \nambiguous in their interpretation. LOR at all informative loci on each \nchromosomal arm represents the typical finding in oligodendrogliomas \nwith 1p \nand 19q deletion. \nFDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results \nfrom a \nstand-alone diagnostic test.

Large portions of cerebral cortex and white matter partially or \ntotally effaced by a glial neoplastic proliferation with features \nsimilar to those ones described for parts B and C. In here, however, \nthere are focal areas with greater cellularity (\"proliferation \ncenters11), in which mitotic activity is readily identified.

Epidermal growth factor receptor variant \nIII \n(EGFRvIII) is an oncogenic, constitutively active mutant form of EGFR \nthat is \ncommonly expressed in glioblastoma. Cell culture and in vivo models of \nglioblastoma have demonstrated EGFRvIII as defining prognostically \ndistinct \nsubgroups of glioblastomas. Additionally, the presence of EGFRvIII has \nbeen \nshown to sensitize tumors to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors when the \ntumor \nsuppressor protein PTEN is intact. RNA is extracted from formalin \nfixed, \nparaffin embedded tissue samples and reverse transcribed to eDNA. The \ncDNA is \nthen amplified using standard PCR technique for DNA templates. PCR \nproducts \nare detected by gel electrophoresis. The limit of detection of this \nassay has \nbeen determined to be approximately 5 mutant cells in 100 normal \ncells. \nFDA Comment: The above data are not to be construed as the results \nfrom a \nstand alone diagnostic test.

The analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by \nserial \ndilution of methylated positive control DNA into unmethylated DNA, and \nwas \nassessed to be 1% of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated \nDNA. \nFactors such as the presence of >50% non-neoplastic cells in the \nsample, or \nextensive tissue necrosis, may preclude the detection of methylated \nMGMT \npromoter sequences. \nFDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results \nfrom a \nstand alone diagnostic test.

Variable cytoarchitectural patterns are evident, ranging from sparsely\ncellular microcystic, through to microscopic nodular areas where the neoplastic\ncells aggregate closely, and have a variably pleomorphic and hyperchromatic\nnuclei, minimal cytoplasm, and demonstrates some nuclear angulation and\n.irregularity.

Low-grade and sometimes mierocystic\nareas typically have low MTS .1 indices, with relatively rare nuclear labelling,\nbut the small hypercellular foci. demonstrate elevated labelling.\nImmunohistdchemical staining for p5.3 protein demonstrates no convincing nuclear\npositivity. Synaptophysin staining is evident in many of the neopl..astic cells,\nparticularly in hypercellular foci, and takes the form of granular Cytoplasmic\npositivity, sometimes with perinuclea.r dot like exenteration. There is no\nconvincing positivity for\u00b0NeuN., which highlights scattered mononuclear neuronal\ncells, which do not demonstrate abnormal clustering or cytologic ,features such\nas bi.nucleation..

There is no specific grading scheme for ohigoastrocytoma in the\nmost recent WHO Classification of Tumors of the CNS. In grading\noligcastrocytoma, many authorities now adopt the same grading scheme as used for\nof igodendrogl iorma. The minimum criteria for a diagnosis of WHO Grade III\nanaplastic gli.oma in this setting are not well defined. Many authorities regard\nmitotic activity (greater than 5 mitotic figures per 10 high power fields) as a valuable parameter of anaplasia in the absence of endothelial proliferation,\npalisading necrosis, or frankly an.aplastic cytology and hypercellularity.. In\nthis case, overt features of anaplasia are not evident, but the maximal mitotic\ncount exceeds 5 mitotic figures per 10 high power fields, and in hypercellular\nfoci the MIB I determined proliferation index is relatively high.. As such, the\nfindings areamount to a WHO grade III oligoast.rocytoxna.\nPAT HOLO\" * - --\nDATED:\nELECTRONICALLY VALIDATED:\n-------------------- END OF REPORT FOR-------------------\nPage 2\nDOCT OR\nDOC.

The 3 markers\non 1p are D1S548, D1S1592, and D1S552 (with D1S468, D1S1612, and D1S496 as\nbackup markers) and the 3 markers on 19q are D19S219, D19S412, and PLA2G4C\n(with D19S606 and D19S1182 as backup). All markers are microsatellites (2 or\n4\nnt repeats) except PLA2G4C which is a minisatellite (26 nt repeat)\npolymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score,\namplicon size,and ease of interpretation. The backup markers are used if the\nfirst line markers at that chromosome arm are uninformative or otherwise\nambiguous in their interpretation.

Assessment of \nMGMT promoter methylation \u00b7status involves bisulfite treatment of DNA followed \nby real-time PCR amplification (MethyLight) of methylated and unmethylated DNA \nsequences. The analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by serial \ndilution of methylated positive control DNA into unrnethylated DNA, and viaS \nassessed to be 1% of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated DNA. \nFactors such as the presence of >50% non-neoplastic cells in the sample, or \nextensive tissue necrosis, may preclude the detection of methylated MGMT \npromoter sequences. \nFDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a \nstand alone diagnostic test.

Cell culture and in vivo models of \nglioblastoma have demonstrated EGFRvIII as defining prognostically distinct \nsubgroups of glioblastomas. Additionally, the presence of EGFRvIII has been \nshown to sensitize tumors to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors when the tumor \nsuppressor protein PTEN is intact.

The analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by \nserial \ndilution of methylated positive control DNA into unmethylated DNA, and \nwas \nassessed to be l~ of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated \nDNA. \nFactors such as. the presence of >50~ non-neoplastic cells in the \nsample, or \nextensive tissue necrosis, may preclude the detection of methylated \nMGMT \npromoter sequences. \nFDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results \nfrom a \nstand alone diagnostic test.

Intermixed amongst these cells and seen separately i n small clusters, are neoplastic cells with \npredominantly round nuclei and an apparent paucity of fibrillary processes. Overall, cytologic atypia appears moderate with scattered cells showing more significant atypia. The tumor cells are embedded in a variably fibrillary and myxoid background. In areas, the cells are arranged in distinct cellular nests with foci of prominent clustering around blood vessels. Neither necrosis nor microvascular proliferation are seen. Up to four mitotic figures per 10 high powe r fields are counted.  \n Addendum Discussion:  \nThe tumor cells are negative for expression of synaptophysin. They demonstrate strong positivity for GFAP. The calculated MIB-1 Labeling Index is 10.7%. Overall, the histologic features in conjunction with the M IB-1 Labeling index are consistent with a \nhigh grade glioma.   \nAddendum Diagnosis:  \nRight Frontal Brain Tumor, Biopsy and Resection: \nAnaplastic Oligoastrocytoma, Oligodendroglial predominant (Who Grade III) MIB -1 Labeling Index = 10.7%  \n  \n",

PROCEDURES/ADDENDA \nMGMT Promoter Methylation \nDate Ordered: \nInterpretation Date Reported: \nNEGATIVE: No evidence of methylated MGMT promoter is detected. \nResults-Comments \nTesting performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block \nTEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT promoter \nhave been shown to benefit from therapy with alkylating agents. Assessment \nof \nMGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite treatment of DNA \nfollowed by real-time PCR amplification (MethyLight) of methylated and unmethylated \nDNA sequences. The analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by serial \ndilution of methylated positive control DNA into unmethylated DNA, and was \nassessed to be 1% of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated DNA. \nFactors such as the presence of >50% non-neoplastic cells in the sample, or \nextensive tissue necrosis, may preclude the detection of methylated MGMT \npromoter sequences. \nFDA COMMENT: The above data are not be construed as the results from a \nstand alone diagnostic test.

Epidermal growth factor receptor variant III \n(EGFRvIII) is an oncogenic, constitutively active mutant form of EGFR that \nis \ncommonly expressed in glioblastoma. Cell culture and in vivo models of \nglioblastoma have demonstrated EGFRvIII as defining prognostically distinct \nsubgroups of glioblastomas. Additionally, the presence of EGFRvIII has been \nshown to sensitize tumors to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors when the tumor \nsuppressor protein PTEN is intact. RNA is extracted from formalin fixed, \nparaffin embedded tissue samples and reverse transcribed to eDNA. The cDNA \nis \nthen amplified using standard PCR technique for DNA templates. PCR products \nare detected by gel electrophoresis. The limit of detection of this assay \nhas \nbeen determined to be approximately 5 mutant cells in 100 normal cells. \nFDA Comment: The above data are not to be construed as the results from \nstand alone diagnostic test.

Indeed, surgical residua of this procedure are noted in specimen #7.\nMultiple biopsies from the frontal lobe, and tumor immediately adjacent to the\nsurgical cavity (specimen #7) shows astrocytoma with marked cytologic atypia,\nhypercellularity and scattered mitotic figures. The degree of atypia attains\nthat of high grade astrocytoma, WHO Grade III. The diagnostic features of\na glioblastoma multiforme, i.e. necrosis, endothelial proliferation, are not\nidentified. Diffusely involving the majority of the resected tissue in\nspecimens #7,#8 and #9 is astrocytoma with grade II features :moderate\nhypercellularity, inconspicuous mitotic figures, and mild to moderate nuclear\natypia. overall, we estimate that approximately 20% of the tumor resected shows\ngrade III features and approximately 80% shows grade II features. This is of\ncourse a somewhat arbitrary estimate, as the differentiating criteria\n(hypercellularity, atypia) exist on a spectrum and are not clearly delineated.\nDIAGNOSIS\n1.BRAIN,LEFT FRONTAL LOBE, BIOPSY:\nHIGHGRADE ASTROCYTOMA ( SEE SPECIMEN #7).\nPage 2 L.BRAIN,LEFT FRONTAL LOBE, BIU1'SY:\nHIGH GRADE ASTROCYTOMA (SEE SPECIMEN #7).\n3.BRAIN,LEFT FRONTAL LOBE, BIOPSY:\n-HIGH GRADE ASTROCYTOMA ( SEE SPECIMEN #7).\n4.BRAIN,LEFT TEMPORAL LOBE, BIOPSY:\nHIGH GRADE ASTROCYTOMA ( SEE SPECIMEN #7).\n5.BRAIN,LEFT TEMPORAL LOBE, BIOPSY:\n-HIGH GRADE ASTROCYTOMA (SEE SPECIMEN #7).\n6.BRAIN, DEEP LEFT FRONTAL LOBE,EXCISION:\nASTROCYTOMA, LOW GRADE, WHO GRADE II, 2.2 CM I\nSEE COMMENT AND SPECIMEN #7.NGREATEST DIMENSION.\n7.BRAIN,LEFT FRONTAL LOBE, EXCISION:\n-ASTROCYTOMA ,HIGH GRADE ,WHO GRADE III; ARISING IN THE BACKGROUND OF\nDIFFUSE ASTROCYTOMA ( I.E.

Semifirm, tanish-white. In total, 16-19. \nMICROSCOPIC: A. Portions of cerebral cortex and adjacent white \nmatter \nwhich are focally extensively infiltrated by a neoplastic \nproliferation \nof glial cells. The neoplastic cells have rather small nuclei with \nmoderate nuclear pleomorphism, and diffusely permeate the white matter \nand cortex with prominent perineuronal satellitosis and focal subpial \naccumulation. Mitotic figures are occasionally seen, however, \nmicrovascular cellular proliferation or necrosis is absent. \nB. Fragments of brain tissue extensively infiltrated by a neoplasm \nsimilar to that described for part A. The cellularity is higher and \nthe nuclear pleomorphism is more prominent in this specimen, and \nmitotic figures are also observed. Again, microvascular cellular \nproliferation and necrosis are absent. \nC. Portions of brain tissue extensively infiltrated by a neoplasm \nsimilar to that described for part A. \nD. Portions of hippocampus which are focally infiltrated by a \nneoplasia similar to that described for part B, which is effacing the \ndentate gyrus and pyramidal cell layer. \nSPECIAL STAINS: MIB-1 and factor VIII AA immunoperoxidase methods \nwere \npreformed on blocks 5 and 14. \nWith the MIB-l, a labelling index of about 15% was determined on \nsection 14 in areas of solid tumor. With the FVIII AA, no endothelial  microvascular proliferation was demonstrated. \nCOMMENT: In all the four specimens, there is extensive infiltration \nof \nthe gray and white matter by a fibrillary astrocytoma. The tumor \neffaces the normal cortical architecture with the presence of \nprominent \nsatellitosis and focal subpial accumulation. \nthroughout the specimens are considered to be \nneurons, The neurons present \nnative entrapped \nnot part of the neoplasm. The tumor is moderately cellular with \nmoderate nuclear pleomorphism, and is not difficult to find mitotic \nfigures. However, microvascular cellular proliferation and necrosis \nare absent. The cellularity, degree of nuclear atypia and presence of \nmitoses with a high MIB-1 labelling index of 15%, justify a diagnosis \nof anaplastic astrocytoma. The absence of endothelial proliferation, \nhowever, probably places this neoplasm at the low end of the spectrum \nof anaplastic astrocytomas. \nTISSUE \nBILLING CODES ",

Increased\nmethylation of the MGMT gene promoter region causes diminished or\nsilenced expression of the gene, making cells more sensitive to DNA\ndamage. This relationship has been shown for glioblastomas and\nalkylating agents such as Temodar(R)(temozolomide).\nApproximately 40% to 45% of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tumors\nexhibit MGMT gene methylation. Retrospective studies have shown that\ndetection of MGMT promoter methylation in tumor samples is associated\nwith an increased likelihood of a favorable response to temozolomide.\nMethodology:\nDNA is isolated from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE)\nspecimen. Molecular analysis of the MGMT gene is performed by\nmethylation-specific PCR and detected on Molecular-based\ntesting is highly accurate but as in any laboratory test, rare\ndiagnostic errors may occur.\nResults of this test are for Investigational Purposes Only.

The analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by \nserial \ndilution of methylated positive control DNA into unmethylated DNA, and \nwas \nassessed to be 1% of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated \nDNA. \nFactors such as the presence of >50% non-neoplastic cells in the \nsample{ or \nextensive tissue necrosis, may preclude the detection of methylated \nMGMT \npromoter sequences. \nFDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results \nfrom a \nstand alone diagnostic test.

TCGA-DB-5281 \nADDENDA: \nlp and 19q FISH studies were performed on cells within paraffin sections from tnmor. Two hybridizations were \nperformed: one with a 19qprobe/controll9p pair and one with alp probe/controllq pair. The 19q and lp probes \nmapped to the regions that are commonly deleted in gliomas. The 19q to 19p probe ratio was 1.02. The lp to lq \nprobe ratio was 0.87. For both probes, the normal ratio is approximately 1. Any ratio less than 0.80 is consistent \nwith deletion of the chromosomal region of interest. \nthere was no evidence of deletion of lp or 19q. However, approximately 70% of the cells had 3-4 copies of the lp, \nlq, 19p, and 19q probes. Similar results have been observed in other glioma specimens with gain of chromosomes \nI and 19.

Clinical and pathologic correlation is recommended.  \n    \n  \nThis diagnostic report has been personally interpreted by the signatory  \nof record.  \n      Data Analysis:  \n  DESC RIPTION OF THE ASSAY: 1p and 19q FISH studies were performed on  \nparaffin embedded tumor sections. Two hybridizations were performed:  \none with a 1p/1q probe/control pair and one with a 19q/19p  \nprobe/control pair.  The 19q and 1p probes map to regions that are  \ncommonly deleted in gliomas.  The nuclei are counterstained with DAPI  \nand the cells examined by epi -fluorescence microscopy.  The total  \n number \nof counts for each probe is determined in 200 cells and the  \nratios of 1p/1q and 19q/19p are calculated.  \n  \nNorm al range: The normal ratio is approximately 1. Any ratio > 0.80 is  \nconsidered normal.  \n  LIMITATIONS: Low levels of malignant cells in the specimen can result  \nin a false negative result. As with all laboratory tests, sampling  \nerror and other factors may aff ect the outcome of the assay.  \nCorrelation of results with other clinical and laboratory data should  \nbe obtained.  \n  COMMENT: This test was developed and its performance characteristics  \ndetermined by the Molecular Pathology Laboratory at \n. It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S.  \nFood and Drug Administration.  \nThis test is not to be used as a diagnostic procedure without  \nconfirmation of the diagnosis by another medically established product  \nor procedure.  \n      Clinica l History and Diagnosis:  \nRight post central tumor consistent with Glioma: Oligoastrocytoma with  \nFocal anaplastic changes.  \n    Source of Specimen:  \n1: FISH -BRAIN  \n  Gross Description:  \n \nFormalin -fixed paraffin -embedded tissue  \n   Histology Laboratory  \n \n  \n \n",

ACCESSION .\nAddendum Discussion\nMGMT METHYLATION ASSAY : GENE METHYLATION NOT DETECTED.\nMGMT Methvlation Assay was performed on sections from block \"1B\" by in\nThe results of this assay are reported below:\nMGMT Methylation Assay:\nResult: Gene Methylation\u2022NOT detected.\nMethylation Score: 1.35\n--REFERENCE VALUE--\nunmethylated <2.00\nmethylated >=2.00\nBackground:\nMGMT [0(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase] is a DNA repair enzyme that is\ninvolved in the repair of damage caused by a variety of DNA crosslinking compounds,\nincluding alkylating agents. Increased methylation of the MGMT gene promotor\nregion causes diminished or silenced expression of the gene, making cells more\nsensitive to DNA damage. This relationship has been shown for glioblastomas and\nalkylating agents such as temozolomide. Approximately 40-50% of glioblastomas\nexhibit MGMT gene methylation. Retrospective studies have shown that detection of\nMGMT promotor methylation in tumor samples is associated with an increased\nlikelihood of a favorable response to.temozolomide.\nMethodology:\nDNA is isolated from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens.\nMolecular analysis of the MGMT gene is performed by methylation-specific PCR and\ndetected on AB17900. The MGMT and beta-Actin copy numbers are used to calculate\nthe ratio of MGMT/beta-Actin x1000. Molecular-based testing is highly accurate,\nbut as in any laboratory test, rare diagnostic errors may occur. Results of this\ntest are for Investigational Purposes Only. The performance characteristics of\nthis assay have been determined by The result should not be used as a\ndiagnostic procedure without confirmation of the diagnosis by another medically\nestablished diagnostic product or procedure.\nI certify that Ipersonally conducted the\ndiagnostic evaluation on the above specimen(s)\nand have rendered the above diagnosis(es):\nelectronic signature\n'rimary rdmo \u202251a Discr_ pa's.y\nIIPAA Disaepa\"cy\n,riot Malign ing History\nlu; I/Synch, or nus\"Prim a\n:&se is (ciclel:\nreviewer Initials",

However, focally the\nneoplasm appears fibrillary and somewhat astrocytic. In addition,\nmitotic figures are occasionally found, but microvascular cellular proliferation is absent ,and there are no areas of necrosis. Special\nstains are being requested to better characterize the neoplasm, and an\naddendum report will follow.\nADDENDUM REPORT\nSPECIAL STAINS :Bielschowsky stain was performed on section from block\n#4.\nThe stain demonstrates various densities of axons throughout the tumor.\nIMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY :Immunoperoxidase methods for GFAP, p53,\nsynaptophysin ,and MIB -1 were performed on sections from block #4.\nThe GFAP depicts reactive astrocytosis throughout the zones of the\nbrain parenchyma infiltrated by the tumor. In these zones there is\nbackground synaptophysin immunoreactivity ,and rarely a ganglion cell\nhas perikaryal positivity (interpreted as entrapped native neurons).\nwhere there is solid tumor, there is no synaptophysin or GFAP reaction,\nand with the MIB-1 a proliferation index of 7% is determined.

The \nneoplastic cells are medium-sized, have hyperchromatic pleomorphic \nnuclei, and the nuclear outline tends to be elongated or ovoid. In \nthe \nbackground there is a uniform finely fibrillary internuclear space. \nThroughout the neoplasm there are branching small vessels, frequently \narciform. There are frequent mitotic figures, and there are focal \nareas of tumor necrosis and prominent microvascular cellular \nproliferation. Rather iarely, ther~ are clear halos around neoplastic \nnuclei. In a couple of areas there is chunky microcalcification. \nSPECIAL STAINS: Irnrnunoperoxidase methods for GFAP and MIB-1 ~;ere \nperformed on sections from block #2. \nThe GFAP highlights the fine gliofibrillary background.

The \nproliferation index is high at about 22% The predominant cellular \n pattern and architecture are interpreted as oligodendroglial in \nnatu~e, \nhowever with some astrocytic component.

Recurrent /residual oligoastrocytoma.\n2. Radiation induced changes (see comment).\nComment\nScant viable tumor is present in specimen A. and definite viable tumor is present in specimen B. Tumor\ncells show\nmoderately pleomorphic round to oval to angulated nuclei. Mitotic figures are rare .Necrosis, astrogliosis,vascular\nchanges and chronic inflammation related to radiation therapy are noted. Immunohistochemicalstains areperformed\non specimen B. GFAP demonstrated reactive astrogliosis and highlights occasional tumor cells. The Ki-67 labeling\nindex is approximately 2 to 3% in the tumor areas of lower cellularity and approximately 5 to 10% in areasof higher\ncellularity, but this higher activity is often associated with chronic inflammation and/or vascular changes.\nWith the exception of the radiation induced changes, the remaining tumor appears histologically similar tothe patient's\nprevious specimen in terms of histopathological grade being. Some mild microvascular proliferation is\nnoted, but is not\ndefinitely associated with tumor, as it also appears in areas of reactive gliosis, and may be secondary toradiation.\nConvincing histopathological evidence for definite transformation from a WHO grade II to grade III lesion\nis lacking.\nThis could be due to sampling phenomenon. The fact that the lesion shows new enhancing fociradiologically however\nsuggeststhat it has progressed to a WHO grade I I I lesion.

The astrocytic component of the tumor consists perdominantly of cells w ith gemistocytic features, including eccentric moderately \nplemorphic nuclei and abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm. The oligodendrocytic component of the tumor is characterized by numerous neoplastic cells with round to oval nuclei and prominent perinuclear halos. The two populations of tumor cells in some areas are intermixed and in others areas appear separate. Overall, the ctyologic atypia appears moderate. There is a background of microcystic change. The tumor diffusely infiltrates adjacent brain parenchyma. Scattered mitotic figures are seen. Microvascular proliferation is prevalent. Foci of early micronecrosis are seen. The low mitotic activity of the tumor (up to 2 mitoses per 10 high power fields) and the moderate degree of pleomorphism would suggest a low grade glioma; however, the presence of prominent microvascular proliferation and foci of early necrosis are concerning for a high grade tumor. A final diagnosis will be issued pending review of MIB-1.    \nAddendum Discussion:  \nThe MIB -1 labeling index ranges up to 6.9% in the most proliferative regions of tumor. \nThe elevated MIB -1 labeling index, in conjunction with the immunohistochemical \nfeatures support an oligoastrocytoma with features concerning for early anaplastic \nprogression. The findings of early micronecrosis and microvascular proliferation are worrisome for anaplastic progression. The degree of necrosis is not felt to be substantial \nenough to classify this tumor as a glioblastoma with oligodendroglial differentiation; however, this neoplasm should be closely followed.   \nDiagnosis: \nOligoastrocytoma with early anaplastic progression.

The cells are tightly packed and demonstrate \nperinuclear clearing in some areas. Focal microvascular proliferation \nis also \nseen in some areas along with frequent calcospherites. Areas of \nnecrosis are \nalso noted. Mitoses range from 3 to 4 per ten 400x fields. \nThe tumor cells are diffusely highlighted by GFAP, while p53 stain \nshows \ndiffuse weak to moderate positivity of the tumor nuclei. CD163 stains \nrare \nphagocytic cells. The Ki-67 labeling index is approximately 25%. \nPositive and negative controls show appropriate immunoreactivity. \nMolecular studies showed LOH for 1p/19q (see procedure addenda below). \n======================================================================= \n PROCEDURES/ADDENDA \nPCR for Epidermal Growth \nDate Ordered:  \nMGMT Promoter Methylation \nDate Ordered:  \nInterpretation Factor Receptor \nDate Reported: \nDate Reported: \nPOSITIVE: Methylated MGMT promoter is detected. \nResults-Comments \nTesting performed on paraffin tissue block Pending \n \nH stained slide was examined for subsequent tumor \ndissection. \nSufficient tumor cells were present in the tissue block and no \nmicrodissection \nwas needed. \nTEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT \npromoter \nhave been shown to benefit from therapy with alkylating agents. \nAssessment of \nMGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite treatment of DNA \nfollowed \nby real-time PCR amplification (MethyLight) of methylated and \nunmethylated DNA \nsequences. The analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by \nserial \ndilution of methylated positive control DNA into unmethylated DNA, and \nwas \nassessed to be 1% of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated \nDNA. \nFactors such as the presence of >50% non-neoplastic cells in the \nsample1 or \nextensive tissue necrosis, may preclude the detection of methylated \nMGMT \npromoter sequences. \nFDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results \nfrom a \nstand alone diagnostic test.

All markers are microsatellites \n(2 or 4 \nnt repeats) except PLA2G4C which is a minisatellite (26 nt repeat) \npolymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score, \namplicon size, and ease of interpretation. The backup markers are used \nif the \nfirst line markers at that chromosome arm are uninformative or \notherwise \nambiguous in their interpretation.

Most of the tumor is composed of large \nepithelioid cells although some areas are composed of smaller cells with scant \ncytoplasm. Frequent mitotic figures, occasional apoptotic bodies and large \nareas of necrosis are present. Microvascular proliferation and \npseudopalisading necrosis are not prominent features. Immunohistochemical \nstains show that he tumor is GFAP, vimentin and SlOO positive. RMB-45 and \npan-keratin are negative. Occasional cells show diffuse EMA cytoplasmic \npositivity. The reticulin pattern is somewhat biphasic as are the GFAP and \nvimentin staining patterns.
