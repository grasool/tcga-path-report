Microsatellite instability is not detected in the carcinoma by immunohistochemistry ;therefore ,the likelihood that the
carcinoma is due to sporadic or hereditary (i.e.: Lynch syndrome -associated )defective DNA mismatch repair is very low.
However ,immunohistochemistry may not detect rare polymorphisms or missense mutations in DNA mismatch repair proteins
in up to 10% of cases .If strong clinical suspicion persists, additional testing is suggested.
Archived slides and paraffin blocks were reviewed for case block Al0 containing normal tissue and carcinoma was selected for MSI analysis.
Irnmamohistochemical studies were performed on formalin fixed ,paraffin -embedded tissue with adequate positive and negative control sections, including internal
positive control tissue.
The performance characteristics of these antibodies were determined by the _
They have not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration .The FDA has
determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary .These tests are used for clinical purposes .They should not be regarded as investigational or for research.

findings indicate an intact mismatch repair (MMR) gene function without evidence of significant microsatellite instability (MSI).
Although these findings make the diagnosis of hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer (HNPCC) or Lynch Syndrome very unlikely

SPECIMEN (S) SUBMITTED :GROSS DESCRIPTION
Right colon: In formalin labeled ""right colon"" is a 25 cm in length segment of cecum and right colon with an attached 20 cm of
terminal ileum and a 6 cm attached appendix. Within the right colon there is a 4.2 x 4 cm endophytic tumor with raised rolled
borders. This tumor is 9 cm from the distal margin and 24.5 cm from the proximal margin. The tumor invades into and through
the bowel wall into the pericolonic fat and is grossly 3 cm from the circumferential soft tissue margin. The tumor also appears to
near the serosa/peritonealized surface of the attached fat. There is an additional 4 x 3 cm polypoid mass 4.5 cm from the distal
margin and 29 cm from the proximal margin. The mucosa and wall adjacent to this mass is ragged, disrupted and hemorrhagic
with hemorrhage and necrosis in the surrounding pericoloic soft tissues. No gross invasion beyond the wall is noted and this
mass is 6 cm from the circumferential soft tissue margin. Within the cecum there is an additional 4.5 x 2.7 x 1.8 cm exophytic
polypoid mass. This mass is 17 cm from the distal margin and 22 cm from the proximal margin. Again, no invasion through the
wall is noted and the mass is 9 cm from the circumferential soft tissue margin. The remaining colonic mucosa is tan-pink with
several additional smaller, up to 0.6 cm, mucosal polyps and focal areas of congestion. The ileal mucosa is tan-pink with a few
polypoid projections and a 2.3 x 1.3 cm flat granular area 6 cm from the proximal margin and 27 cm from the distal margin. No
invasion into the mesenteric fat is noted and the lesion is 3.5 cm from the mesenteric resection margin. The cut surfaces of the
appendix display a lumen lined by congested mucosa. Multiple lymph nodes are identified in the attached fat. Representative
sections are submitted as labeled: A-C tumor in ascending colon to pericolonic fat and serosal/peritonealized surface; D-E distal
ascending colon polypoid mass with adjacent ragged hemorrhagic disrupted area; F-G cecal polypoid mass; H smaller colonic
mucosal polyps; I flat and granular irregular area in small bowel; J small bowel mucosa with small polypoid projections; K distal
margin and en face circumferential soft tissue margin; L proximal margin and appendix; M six lymph nodes; N six lymph nodes;
0 six lymph nodes; P six lymph nodes.

microscopic Exam ination
Microscopic examination is performed. Within part A, the fallopian tube
fimbria demonstrates a focal area of mild cytologic atypic.
Immunohistochemistry of this area (block Al) reveals weak/low cytokeratin 7,
p53 and Ki67 expression. Cytokeratin 20, Pax8 and CDX2 are negative. In
comparison, the tumor present in the colon demonstrates strong cytokeratin 20
and CDX2 expression and is negative for Pax8, p53, and cytokeratin 7. Ki6'7 is
moderately elevated. Overall, the findings in the fallopian tube are felt to
be secondary to cautery artifact. Dr. has reviewed parts of this case
and concurs with the interpretation.

GROSS DESCRIPTION 
Received fresh in a container labeled ""extended right 
hemicolectomy -subtotal colectomy"" is a segment of bowel 
consisting of 6 em. of terminal ileum \·lith 50 em of contiguous 
colon. There is a 30 x 11 x 1 em. portion of omentum which is 
adherent to the outer aspect of the colon wall over an area 6 x 5 
em, with induration of the omentum in that area. The serosal 
surface 
the of the bowel away from where the omentum is attached is glistening 
and tan-pink. No appendix is present with the specimen. The bm·1el 
is opened. The small bowel averages 4.5 em. in circumference and 
colon averages 8.5 em. in circumference. The mucosa of the small 
bowel is tan-pink, smooth, and glistening, with a normal pattern of 
folds. There are no focal lesions in the small bowel. The colon is 
notable for a circumferential mass, with the bowel 12 em. in 
circumference in this region, with this mass 9 em. long and 
maximally 1.2 em. thick. Sectioning through the mass reveals the 
tumor to invade through the bowel wall into fat in the region with 
adherent omentum noted above, appearing to involve the omentum. The 
tumor comes very near to1 but does not clearly reach1 the outer 
margin. The tumor is 24 ern. from the distal resection margin. The

colon"", and consists of a segment of large bovml, 
measuring 
20 em. in length and 2.8 em. in diameter. There is abundant 
pericolonic fat and the entire specimen is up to 10 em. in 
diameter. 
There is a suture at the open end of the specimen, the opposite end 
is stapled. There is an area of narrowing \Vhere an appendix 
epiploica is adherent to the serosal surface of the colon. This 
area is 6 em. from the open end. The bowel is opened with a 
single 
like 
X incision on the antimesenteric surface. There is a napkin ring-
fungating mucosal tumor, measuring 6 em. in length and 1.2 em. in 
depth. The tumor is circumferential. It is 6 em. from the distal 
margin of resection and approximately 11 em. from the proximal 
margin. Sections after fixation and clearing. A portion of the 
specimen is taken for research purposes. The fat is dissected off 
the colon and there is an area that probably represents pericolonic 
abscess immediately adjacent to the tumor. This area might be 
associated with diverticulum. MLM:men

 GROSS DESCRIPTION 
             A.  Received fresh subsequently fixed in formalin labeled              ""sigmoid, upper rectum with adherent posterior bladder 
wall 
    and small intestines"".  The specimen consists of a rectosigmoid 
    colon with adherent portions of small bowel and possible portion of 
    bladder.  A segment of small bowel was 12 cm long, stapled at both     ends, which are arbitrarily inked blue and black.  A portion of 
    colon is 46 cm long.  Both ends are stapled, inked blue and the 
    opposite is opened and is inked black.  There is also a small 
    portion of possible bladder, which is 7 x 5 cm.  This is smooth to 
    slightly velvety and the margin of this is inked blue.  Orientation     cannot be determined.  One end away from the tumor is inked blue. 
    The opposite end close to the tumor is inked black.  The specimen 
is     opened to show a large fungating mass, which is 12 x 11.5 x 3.5 cm. 
    This comes within 2.5 cm of the black inked margin.  This tumor is     centrally necrotic and goes through the wall of the colon, into the 
    surrounding fat and through the wall of the small bowel into the 
    mucosa of the small bowel.  The remainder of the mucosa of small 
    bowel is pink- tan smooth glistening with normal slightly dilated 
    poles having an average circumference of 6.5 cm and the mucosal 
    alteration of tumor is 3.5 x 3.5 cm.  This comes within equidistant 
    luminal margins of the small bowel.  The tumor also comes through 
    the wall into the fat and possibly involves the mucosa of the 
    portion of bladder.  This is velvety, coming within 0.5 cm of the 
    nearest peripheral margin.  The remainder of the mucosa of the     specimen is pink- tan smooth glistening with an average 
circumference                                        of 9.5 cm.  The tumor comes within 1.5 cm of being circumferential 
    and shows a markedly necrotic central focus.  Lymph nodes are 
    grossly identified.  Representative sections of the specimen are     submitted as follows: 
 
    BLOCK SUMMARY:  1 - Representative luminal margins of small bowel, 
2     - representative section of small bowel tumor, 3- 4 - representative

           B.  Received in formalin labelled ""appendix"" is a 6.3 x 0.7 
cm           appendix 
    which is partially covered with pink- tan smooth glistening serosa 
    and yellow 
    lobular fat.  The specimen is sectioned to show an intact wall with 
    an average thickness of 0.4 cm.  The lumen ranges from pinpoint to 
    0.4 cm and shows 
    possible diverticula present.  No other discrete gross lesions are 
    identified.  The entire specimen with the exception of the fat is     submitted in t settes.  AS- 2 (fat retained), proximal end 
    inked.  AS- 2.  
 
     
 
MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION 
    A. Microscopic exam of the resection shows: 
    Histologic type:  Adenocarcinoma, not otherwise specified 
     Histologic grade:  Moderately differentiated 
    Primary tumor(pT):  Tumor invades through the entire colonic wall     and through the entire adhesed small intestinal wall into the lumen 
     of the small intestine.  The tumor also invades into the 
muscularis 
     propria of the bladder wall (pT4b). 
     Proximal margin:  Negative for tumor.      Distal margin:  Negative for tumor. 
     Circumferential (radial) margin:  Negative for tumor although not 
     truly applicable given the resection of the adhered additional 
      organs. 
     Distance of tumor from closest margin:  2.5 from one of the colonic 
     margins 
     Vascular invasion:  Not identified. 
     Regional lymph nodes (pN): 30 lymph nodes are dissected from the 
     specimen and they are all negative for metastatic (pN0).      Non- lymph node pericolonic tumor:  Present in the soft tissue 
     adhesing the small intestine and the bladder to the upper       rectal/sigmoid colon resection.  No discrete additional nodules 
of 
      
 
 
   
  
 
  pericolonic tumor seen. 
     Distant metastasis (pM):  Cannot evaluate pMX. 
     Other findings:  There is significant necrosis of the tumor in the 
     central areas.              B. Microscopic examination of the appendix reveals a 
benign 
             mucocele at the tip.  No dysplasia or malignancy is 
    identified.  There is focal fibrous obliteration of the tip 
    including obliteration of the diverticulum. There is acute serositis 
    and ahdesions.

 GROSS DESCRIPTION 
             A.  Received in formalin labeled ""apical lymph node"" is a 
             0.8 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm yellow fatty tissue fragment which may     be possible lymphoid tissue. The tissue is entirely submitted in 
one 
    cassette.   
             B. eived fresh subsequently fixed in formalin labeled              ""sigmoid and upper rectum"".  The specimen grossly consists     of a 20- cm long portion of colon which is stapled at the distal end 
    (inked black) and opened at the proximal end (inked blue).  The     serosa of the specimen is pink- tan smooth and glistening partially 
    covered with abundant yellow lobular fat. Retroperitoneal reflection     is located 6 cm from the distal margin.  The specimen is opened to 
    show a pink- tan smooth glistening mucosa with an average 
    circumference of 5.5 cm.  There is a large exophytic tumor closer 
to 
    the distal end, measuring 5.3 x 6.0 x 1.0 cm.  This is located 3.5     cm from the distal end.  The distal end has a circumference of 7.5 
    cm and the tumor comes within 0.6 cm of being circumferential.  The 
    cut surface of the tumor shows invasion into the muscularis 
propria. 
    However, no discrete invasion is grossly identified into the fat.     This comes within 2.5 cm of the radial margin. A sample was taken 
    for tissure procurement.  The remainder of the mucosa is pink- tan 
    smooth and glistening with normal to slightly dilated folds.  No     other discrete gross lesions are identified in the mucosa. Multiple 
    lymph nodes are grossly identified in the fat which are firm and     somewhat enlarged up to 1.7 cm in greatest dimension. 
    Representative sections of the specimen are submitted as follows: 
    Block 1 - representative luminal margin; block 2- 4 - representative 
    section of tumor which includes tumor to normal and tumor into fat;     block 5 - representative radial margin; block 6 - one possible

             is a segment of bowel consisting of 6 cm of terminal ileum 
    with contiguous 23 cm of proximal colon.  The serosal surface is 
    glistening and tan- pink, and there is a moderate amount of attached 
    adipose tissue.  There is an unremarkable appendix present, 
    measuring 6.5 cm long x 0.7 cm in diameter.  On cut surface, it is 
    without focal lesion, without gross evidence of inflammation. The 
    bowel measures 3.6 cm and 8 cm in circumference at the proximal and 
    distal resection margins respectively.  The bowel is opened, and 
    there is a circumscribed 5.3 x 5 cm rubbery white- pink mass located 
    11 cm proximal to the distal margin.  A portion of tumor and of 
    normal tissue are submitted for tissue procurement per the clinical 
    requested.  On sectioning, the tumor has a maximum thickness of 1.6 
    cm, and grossly extends through the musuclaris propria and into 
    surrounding adipose tissue.  It is 1 cm from the outer surface of 
    the specimen.  The remainder of the bowel wall averages 0.5 cm thick 
    and has a tan- pink glistening mucosa with a normal pattern and 
    folds. The adipose tissue is dissected, and soft tan lymph nodes are 
    identified up to 1.8 cm in greatest dimension.  RS- 17, following

GROSS DESCRIPTION 
             Received fresh for tissue procurement labeled ""right 
             hemicolectomy with en bloc"" is a previously unopened, 24 cm 
    segment of proximal right colon with attached 17 cm of distal ileum 
    surfaced by smooth to scabrous tan- pink serosa with a moderate 
    amount of attached mesocolon, mesentery and unremarkable omentum. 
    An irregular 5 x 5 x 2.5 cm fragment of red- brown skeletal muscle is 
    present in the vicinity of the cecal pouch.  The cauterized surface 
    of the portion of abdominal wall is inked blue (representing true 
    surgical resection margin in that area).  A scant amount of adherent 
    omentum and retracted serosal surface are also present in the 
    vicinity of the attached portion of abdominal wall (subsequently 
    inked orange and representing the free radial serosal surface).  An 
    unremarkable 7.2 cm in length, 0.9 cm in diameter appendix is 
    present.  The proximal and distal margins measure 4 and 8 cm in 
    circumference respectively.  On opening, there is a nearly 
    circumferential rubbery tan- white tumor mass at the ileocecal valve 
    measuring 11.0 x 5.7 cm.  On sectioning, the tumor has a maximal 
    thickness of 2.8 cm, grossly extending into the muscularis to within 
    0.5 cm of the inked cauterized resection margin (abdominal wall) 
    (see paired contiguous sections blocks 2&3 and 4&5) and within 0.6 
    cm of the inked free radial serosal surface (see bisected contiguous 
    sections block 6 and 7).  The ileal and remaining colonic mucosa is 
    unremarkable glistening tan- pink with regular folds and the walls 
    average 0.4 cm in thickness.  Two palpable rubbery tan- pink-red 
    apical lymph nodes averaging 1.3 cm in greatest dimension are 
    recovered from the attached mesocolon.  Numerous additional rubbery 
    pale tan lymph nodes, 2.8 cm in greatest dimension, are recovered 
    from the remainder of the mesocolon and mesentery.  A portion of 
    tumor and a portion of normal mucosa are submitted for tissue 
    procurement as requeste  presentative sections are submitted in 
    25 blocks as labeled.  -

    respectively.  On opening, there is a moderately well circumscribed, 
    4.5 x 3.8 cm. rubbery tan white- pink tumor mass located 9 cm. distal 
    to the ileocecal valve.  A portion of tumor and a portion of normal 
    mucosa are submitted for tissue procurement as requested.  On 
    sectioning, the tumor has a maximal thickness of 1.8 cm., grossly 
    extending into the muscularis to within 0.6 cm. of the inked free 
    radial serosal surface. A few soft tan ink polypoid lesions 
    measuring up to 0.6 cm. in greatest dimension are present throughout 
    the remainder of the colon.  The ileal and remaining colonic mucosa 
    is unremarkable, glistening tan pink with regular folds and the 
    walls average 0.5 cm. in thickness.  Multiple soft to slightly 
    rubbery pale tan to tan- red tissues in keeping with lymph nodes 
    measuring up to 1.2 cm. in greatest dimension are recovered from the 
    attached mesocolon and mesentery.  Representative sections are 
    submitted in 15 blocks as labeled.  RS- 15.

GROSS DESCRIPTION 
             A. Received fresh in a container labeled ""colon"" is a 
             segment of colon 23 cm long.  The specimen is received open 
    at both ends, which are arbitrarily inked blue and black.  The 
    serosal surface is tan- pink and glistening.  There is abundant 
    attached yellow adipose tissue.  There is also abundant omentum 
    present, 42 x 5 x 3 cm in greatest dimensions.  The omentum is 
    serially sectioned, and there are no focal lesions.  The segment of 
    bowel is opened.  It averages 6.5 cm in circumference.  5.5 cm from 
    the black- inked end of the specimen, there is a 5.5 x 5 x 3.8 cm 
    tumor mass.  On cut surface, this tumor grossly invades into, and 
    apparently through, the muscularis propria, into surrounding soft 
    tissues.  Although extending near to the serosal surface, tumor does 
    not appear to reach the serosal surface, and is not near the radial 
    margin.  The surface deep to the tumor is inked.  3.5 cm from the 
    blue- inked margin is a separate 3.5 x 3.3 x 2.7 cm polypoid lesion. 
    There is some black tattooing in this region.  On cut surface, the 
    polypoid lesion is exophytic, without definite gross invasion into 
    the bowel wall.  The specimen away from the lesions has a tan- pink 
    glistening mucosa and tan wall.  The adipose tissue is dissected, 
    and multiple tan lymph nodes are identified. RS- 22, following 
    fixation. 
 
    BLOCK SUMMARY:  A1,A2 - omentum; A3 - proximal and distal resection 
    margins; A4- A7 - invasive tumor mass, with one lymph node also 
    included in block A7; A8- A16 - entire polypoid lesion; A17- A22 - 
    lymph nodes. 
 
             B.  Received fresh in a container labeled ""B - small bowel 
             mass"" is a portion of tan tissue with mucosa along one 
    surface, 3 x 2 cm, and 0.3 cm deep, compatible with small bowel.  On 
    the serosal surface there is a tan- white plaque-l ike area, 0.8 x 0.5 
    x 0.1 cm.  A section is submitted for frozen section, including the 
    plaque- like area, and the remainder of the specimen is entirely 
    submitted for permanent sections in three additional blocks. 
             C.  Received in formalin in a container labeled ""appendix"" 
             is a 5.5 cm long x 0.7 cm in diameter appendix.  It is 
    grossly unremarkable, with a tan- pink glistening serosal surface, 
     wall, and tan mucosa.  There are no focal lesions.  AS- 1.

GROSS DESCRIPTION 
             A.  Received fresh in a container labeled ""sigmoid colon"" 
             is a 24 cm long segment of colon, which is received open at 
    one end, which is inked black black, and which is stapled at the 
    opposite end, which is inked blue.  It is 5 cm in circumference at 
    the open end of the specimen, and 9 cm in circumference at the 
    stapled end of the specimen.  The serosal surface is generally 
    tan- pink and glistening, with an area with tattoo pigmented 11 cm 
    from the open end of the specimen.  There is a palpable mass within 
    the bowel in this area, although there is not gross tumor 
    penetration to the serosal surface.  The specimen is opened, 
    revealing a near circumferential 7.5 x 6.5 x 1.5 cm mass lesion, 
    coming to within 4.5 cm of the open end of the specimen.  On cut 
    suface, there is invasion of tumor through the full thickness of the 
    bowel wall and into the surrounding adipose tissue, but the tumor is 
    not near the radial margin.  The mucosa away from this area is area 
    is tan- pink and glistening, with multiple polyps, ranging from 0.3 
    cm to 0.7 cm in greatest dimension.  There is no other worrisome 
    lesion in the bowel.  The adipose tissue is dissected, and multiple 
    soft tan- pink lymph nodes are identified.  RS- 16, according to the 
    accompanying block summary, following fixation. 
 
    BLOCK SUMMARY:  A1 - proximal and distal resection margins; A2- A6 - 
    polyps; A7 - radial margin; A8- A10 - tumor; A11- A15 - lymph nodes, 
    h multiple lymph nodes per block; A16 - one sectioned lymph node. 
     
 
             B.  Received fresh in a container labeled ""segment for 
             liver lesion"" is a wedge- shaped portion of tissue, with a 
    generally tan glistening capsular surface, but with an area of 
    tan- white discoloration on the capsular surface, and with the 
    non- capsular surface of the biopsy irregulary roughened and 
    cauterized.  The specimen spans an area 2 x 1.5 x 1.1 cm.  On cut 
    surface there is a nodular area approximately 0.6 cm in greatest 
    extent in the subcapsular region, corresponding to the discoloraton 
    noted on the capsular surface.  Two sections are submitted for 
    frozen section, with the apparent lesion in block BFS1, and the 
    remainder of the specimen is submitted for permanent sections one 
    additional block.

           previously unopened and unoriented 35 cm. segment of colon 
    surfaced by smooth to slightly scabrous tan- pink serosa with a 
    copious amount of attached mesocolon and omentum. A  palpable area 
    of induration is noted.  The omentum overlying the area is focally 
    retracted and subsequently inked orange.  The pre- serosal surface in 
    the vicinity of the palpable mass is inked black.  The undesignated 
    margins measure 6.0 and 6.5 cm. in circumference respectively.  Upon 
    opening, there is a circumferential 10.5 x 9.5 cm. focally necrotic 
    glistening tan- pink tumor mass which is 9 cm. from the larger 
     circumference margin.  On sectioning, the tumor has a maximal 
    thickness of 2.4 cm. grossly extending through the muscularis to 
     within 0.15 cm. of the inked pre- serosal surface (block 4) and 
    adherent omentum (see blocks #2 and 3).  A portion of tumor and a 
    portion of normal mucosa are submitted for tissue procurement as

GROSS DESCRIPTION
A.Received fresh, subsequently fixed in formalin, labeled
""sigmoid colon"". The specimen consists of a 22 cm. long
portion of colon which is stapled at the proximal end, opened at the
distal end. The proximal end is inked blue and the distal end is
inked black. The specimen is opened to show a pink tan smooth
glistening mucosa with normal to abundant folds. The circumference
of the proximal end is 4.5 cm. and the circumference at the distal
end is 7.5 cm. The specimen shows a 4.8 x 3.5 x 1 cm. tumor which
comes within 5 cm. of the distal margin. The serosa of the specimen
is pink tan smooth glistening and predominantly covered with yellow
lobular fat. The specimen shows a 2.5 x 1.5 cm. serosal
umbilication. This umbilication is inked blue. The tumor also shows
gross invasion through the muscularis propria into the fat. Multiple
lymph nodes are grossly identified in the surrounding fat. There is
a focus of mesenteric margin (peduncle) which feels somewhat
indurated. The proximal lymph node may be present in this area.
There is also a 1.5 x 1.5 irregular indurated focus on the surface
coming in within 9 cm. of the proximal margin. The cut surface of
this induration site shows possible tumor present. There is also a
small polyp grossly identified which is 0.5 cm. this is located 3
cm. from the distal margin. This polyp shows no invasion grossly
identified. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted
for tissue procurement. Representative sections of the remainder of
the specimen are submitted as follows:

Received fresh labeled ""right hemicolectomy"" is a previously unopened
40 cm segment of proximal right colon with attached 15 cm of distal
ileum and an abundant amount of attached mesocolon, mesentery, and
omentum. An unremarkable 9 cm appendix averaging 0.5 cm in diameter is
present. The proximal and distal margins measure 5.2 and 7.8 cm in
circumference respectively. On opening, there is a circumferential,
6.0 x 3.9 cm rubbery tan-white-red tumor mass which is 8 cm from the
distal margin. On sectioning, the tumor has a maximal thickness of 2
cm, grossly extending through the muscularis and into the attached
mesocolon. The tumor is present within 0.2 cm of the inked free radial
serosal surface and visually appears to extend into the attached
omentum. A 3 cm in greatest dimension area of tan red discoloration is
noted within the distal ileum, 5 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve.
The remaining ileal and colonic mucosa is unremarkable tan-pink with
regular folds and the walls average 0.5 cm. A portion of tumor and a
portion of normal colonic mucosa are submitted for tissue procurement
as requested. Multiple soft to slightly rubbery tan-pink tissues in

Diagnosis:
1.: Tumor-free lipomatous atrophic lymph node.
2.: Right hemicolectomy specimen with tumor-free resection margins and under inclusion
of an ulcerated, malignant, solid tumor in the cecum, conforming to the type of a poorly
differentiated adenocarcinoma, with infiltration of the lamina muscularis propria and
without regional lymph node metastases (G3, pT2 LO VO RO pNO 0/27).
Additional immunohistological investigations are being conducted due to the histological
peculiarities of the tumor. A follow-up report on this will be submitted at a later date.
Follow-up report:
From an immunohistological perspective ,the tumor cells were positive for broad-
spectrum cytokeratins .Large numbers of CD3- positive and CD20-negative or T-
lymphocytes are also interspersed.
Based on the histology and immunohistology ,this is thus a poorly differentiated
colorectal adenocarcinoma ,or cecum carcinoma ,with a dense lymphocytic stromal
infiltrate.
The poor tumor differentiation and the dense lymphocytic inflammatory infiltration may
be indicators of the presence of a microsatellite unstable (possibly HNPCC- associated)
colorectal carcinoma.

Diagnosis:
This is a (mainly still) moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma in the cecum
(developed in a tubulovillous adenoma) with histopathological differentiation grade G 2,
with necroses, with tumor infiltration of the wall layers of the colon as far as into the
tunica muscularis, with substantial chronic granulating and recidivist periturnoral
inflammation with an acute inflammatory phase characterized by partially purulent
abscess formation, with inflammatory adhesions between the walls of the cecum and the
ascending colon, with inflammatory adhesions between the external surface of the tumor
and the associated omental fat tissue (in 11), with a chronic inflammation in the pelvic
wall (in 1), as well as with chronic lymphadenitis in the regional lymph nodes with small
focal epithelioid cell reactions and with structured and unstructured giant cells in
individual regional lymph nodes (in II). Furthermore, overview sections taken from the
resection margins are tumor-free and there is a chronic recurrent appendicitis and chronic
granulating and recurrent periappendicitis (in 11). Based on the sections under
investigation, the tumor spread of the cecal carcinoma corresponds to a tumor stage of p
T 2, p N 0, M X, R 0.

Diagnosis:
•The material in I is a partial resection of small intestine with reactive lesions,
The material in 11 is a preparation of the rectosigmoid colon (in clinical terms attributable
to the rectum or the sigmoid colon) with a poorly differentiated carcinoma in the area of the
rectosigmoid junction (G3), with infiltration of blood and lymph vessels (L1, V 1) and a
lymph node metastasis (pN 1).
Locally, the lesion was completely removed.
The distance from the mesorectal fascia was at least 1 cm.
The overall clinical findings and the topography should serve to determine whether this is a
rectal carcinoma in the narrower sense of the term or a carcinoma of the sigmoid colon.

Diagnosis:
This is material shows a highly to moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the colon
(colic carcinoma possibly on the basis of a pre-existing tubulovillous adenoma) with
infiltration of the muscularis and lymph and blood vessel invasion (pT2, L1, V 1),
it also shows free resection margins and a free ligature region and free lymph nodes (pNO),
a chronic appendicitis with partial scarring and
in II) -- corresponding to the clinical data - a characteristic Meckel's diverticulum.

The report describes two separate adenocarcinoma tumors, one located in the cecum and the other at the hepatic flexure in the ascending colon.

Laterality: Not provided
The laterality of the tumors is not explicitly mentioned in the report.

Histology: Adenocarcinoma
The report clearly indicates that both tumors are adenocarcinomas, which is a type of cancer that begins in the glandular cells lining the inside of an organ.

Stage: pT3N1b
Based on the information provided in the report, both tumors have invaded through the muscularis propria into pericolorectal tissues (pT3) and have metastasized to 2-3 regional lymph nodes (N1b).

Grade: High-grade and low-grade
The cecum tumor is described as high-grade, indicating that it is poorly differentiated and more aggressive. The hepatic flexure tumor is described as low-grade, meaning that it is well to moderately differentiated and less aggressive.

Behavior: Malignant
As the report describes two adenocarcinoma tumors with invasive characteristics, the behavior of these tumors is malignant.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The specimen consists of a segment of terminal ileum, cecum, appendix and 
ascending colon with attached mesocolon and omentum. Multiple adhesions are 
seen on the surface of the specimen. The terminal ileum measures 
approximately 7.0 x 3.0 cm. The colonic and cecal segment measures 15.0 x 2.5 
cm. An area of induration and puckering is evident on the anterior aspect 
just above what appears to be ileocecal valve. Opening the colon reveals a 
large fungating ulcerated mass measuring approximately 8.0 x 9.0 cm involving 
the full circumference of the colon. It has a central area of ulceration and 
raised irregular erythematous edges. The appendix is dilated and measures 4.0 
DESCRIPTION: ~~~~~~~~=~~~~~ 
Sections through the tumor demonstrate a variable pattern. In areas, it 
consists of atypical glandular structures formed by cells with irregular and 
hyperchromatic nuclei. Additionally, areas consist of poorly differentiated 
tumor. Here, the cells form solids nests and cords of spindle and polygonal 
shaped cells without gland formation. The tumor invades the muscularis from 
an ulcerated mucosal surface and extends into serosal tissues where it is 
surrounded by a desmoplastic reaction. Sections through sixteen lymph nodes 
disclose lymphoid hyperplasia and reactive changes, but no metastatic tumor. 
The resection margins are free of tumor as well. The serosal surfaces of the

Gross Description: '''::('<=''/<=D DATE: REPORT 
Container labeled ""!!I!~~~~~~'- right colon"" is an 
approximately 14 cm previously opened moderately distorted portion 
of large bowel including cecum, as well as 4.5 cm of previously 
opened terminal ileum. The specimen is covered by a moderate amount 
of pericolic and epiploic adipose tissue in which a 4.3 x 0.6 x 0.6 
grossly unremarkable vermiform appendix is identified. The visible 
serosa is shaggy and gray-brown with several fibrofatty adhesions. 
The wall is up to 0.6 cm edematous and fibrotic. The lumen is lined 
by gray-tan mucosa with preservation of intestinal folds and a small 
amount of submucosal edema. Noted within the cecal pouch at a point 
0.3 cm from the ileocecal valve there is a previously sectioned 
moderately distorted fairly well defined approximately 3.0 x 2.8 cm 
centrally ulcerated finely granular tan brown plaque like lesion 
. with slightly raised rolled borders. This appears to have a gritty 
gray-tan fibrotic cut surface measuring up to 0.7 cm in thickness. 
This grossly appears to focally extend through the wall focally 
shallowly into the surrounding adipose tissue adjacent to the 
ileocecal valve. In addition, this lesion focally appears to extend 
into the appendiceal orifice but does not grossly appear to obstruct 
the appendix. On sectioning, the surrounding adipose tissue shows 
several poorly defined gray tan to brown nodules up to 0.6 cm. Also 
received in the same container are three tissue cassettes each

Gross Description: 
Container labeled ""_""'.!II_II!II- right colon"" is a 17.5 cm 
previously opened portion of large bowel including cecum, as well as 
6.6 cm of attached unopened terminal ileum. The specimen is covered 
by a moderate amount of pericolic, epiploic and omental adipose 
tissue. An 8.6 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm vermiform appendix is identified. 
The visible serosa is shaggy and gray pink. The wall is up to 0.5 cm 
edematous and fibrotic. The lumen is lined by gray-tan mucosa with 
preservation of intestinal folds. Noted within the cecal pouch at a 
point 1.2 cm from the ileocecal valve there is a 3.5 x 3.5 cm finely 
granular centrally ulcerated plaque-like gray pink lesion with 
raised rolled borders. On sectioning, this has a gritty gray-tan 
fibrotic cut surface measuring up to 1.4 cm. This grossly appears to 
extend through the wall and into the surrounding adipose tissue 
grossly to within 0.1 cm of the nearest outer surface margin. This 
lesion grossly impinges on and markedly constricts the appendiceal 
orifice. The appendiceal orifice is markedly constricted to 0.6 cm 
in diameter as opposed to 1.6 cm in diameter in the central portion 
of the appendix. The appendix has an intact gray tan fibrotic wall 
with smooth inner lining containing transparent viscid mucus. No 
gross lesion is noted within the appendix proper. On sectioning, 
the surrounding adipose tissue reveals several poorly defined gray 
tan to yellow nodules up to 2.2 cm. On sectioning the largest 
portion appears to be a mat of nodules having focally necrotic gray 
tan cut surfaces. Several of these nodules appear to be poorly 
defined and are associated with vascular structures. Also received  _tainer are three tissue cassettes each labeled

CPT: 88309 
Comments 
The carcinoma extends up to the serosal surface and in slide F is 
associated with an area of desmoplasia-granulation tissue and 
mesothelial hyperplasia associated with the carcinoma consistent 
with an area of perforation. Therefore, this is staged as a pT4a 
lesion. Multiple lymph nodes are present within the mesentery. Some 
foci consist predominantly of adenocarcinoma with only a small 
amount of residual lymphoid tissue present and these are counted as 
lymph nodes totally replaced by tumor. Seventeen of 20 lymph nodes 
are positive for metastatic carcinoma. In addition, multiple foci of 
Iymphovascular space invasion are present within the mesentery. The 
carcinoma is an adenocarcinoma with focal mucinous component. The 
mucinous component is less than 50% of the tumor and, therefore, 
this does not qualify as a mucinous/colloid adenocarcinoma. Clinical 
correlation and followup is recommended.

diagnosis.

is staged as p T 4a. Eleven of 17 lymph nodes demonstrate metastatic 
carcinoma. Some of the nodes are completely replaced by carcinoma 
with no residual nodal tissue identified. These are counted as lymph 
nodes totally replaced by tumor. Therefore, this is staged as a 
pN2b. In addition, Iymphovascular space invasion is identified and 
the additional classifications of VL are therefore used. The final

Gross Description:
Received in a single container labeled 'fir - right colon
and terminal ileum"" is a 23 cm previously opened portion of large
bowel including cecum, as well as 8 cm of attached previously opened
terminal ileum. The specimen is covered by a moderate amount of
pericolic and epiploic adipose tissue in which a 8.4 x 0.8 x 0.8 cm
grossly unremarkable vermiform appendix is identified. The visible
serosa is foully shaggy and tan pink with a few fibrofatty
adhesions. Noted at a point approximately 9 cm from the distal
margin is a 3.3 x 3.2 cm area of indurated umbilication of the
serosa .The specimen has been received after tissue harvest for
genomic study .Within the specimen container are three tissue
cassettes each labeled ""The bowel wall is up to
0.6 cm edematous and fibrotic The lumen is lined by tan pink mucosa
with preservation of intestinal folds .In the area corresponding to
the umbilication at a point 8.6 cm from the distal margin and 3.8 cm
from the ileocecal valve is a partially sectioned 9 .2 x 7.5 cm
plaque like finely granular centrally ulcerated tan pink lesion with
raised rolled borders .This has a gritty gray tan fibrotic cut
surface measuring up to 3.2 cm in thickness. The lesion grossly
extends through the muscularis but is limited by the serosa in the
area away from the pericolic fat. In the area of the pericolic fat
the lesion grossly appears to focally extend through the wall into
the adipose tissue where it is seen at its nearest point
approximately 0.9 cm from the nearest outer surface margin. The
lesion is noted within 0.1 cm of the outer surface in the area of12 /2 q //Z the serosa. Noted scattered along the length of the bowel are a few
additional tan gray polypoid excrescences up to 0.8 cm which are
unfixed to the underlying muscularis. On sectioning the surrounding
adipose tissue reveals multiple poorly defined fleshy tan pink to
yellow nodules up to 1.5 cm. Representative sections are submitted
labeled as follows: A - proximal margin; B - distal margin; C-G -
representative lesion and surrounding tissue ;H - representative
polyps; I - random uninvolved bowel; J - appendix; K-N - individual

Diagnosis
Rectum with J-pouch, attached bladder and prostate, pelvic
exenteration:
Recurrent poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma involving rectal
mucosa, submucosa, muscularis propria, perirectal adipose tissue and
extensively infiltrating prostatic parenchyma. _
Tumor is present at the right pelvic sidewall margins
The prostatic urethral margin is positive or tumor in parenchyma and
lymphatic spaces
The rectal mucosal and deep margins are negative for tumor
Extensive lymphovascular space invasion and perineural space invasion
Microscopic Description:
Microscopic examination performed and summarized in the template below:
Histologic type: Recurrent adenocarcinoma
Histologic grade: Poorly differentiated
Primary tumor (pT): Although the tumor with somewhat difficult to
define grossly its microscopic spread was quite extensive with
prominent involvement of the rectum and J-pouch and connective tissue
between the rectum and the prostate and extensive infiltration of the
prostate and prostatic urethra and seminal vesicles. Overall the
recurrent tumor measured greater than 5 cm in greatest dimension
Proximal margin: Proximal rectal margin negative for tumor
Distal margins: Distal rectal margin negative for tumor
Circumferential (radial) margin: Right pelvic sidewall is
microscopically positive for tumor with areas of perineural space
invasion. Also tumor was present at the prostatic urethral margin
Vascular invasion: Present and prominent with both lymphatic and venous
invasion identified
Regional lymph nodes (pN): 1 residual lymph node was identified and it
is negative for metastatic tumor (0/1)
Non-lymph node pericolonic tumor: Present
Distant metastasis (pM): Not evaluated
Other findings: There is some acute colitis in the rectum that is
nonspecific. There are some nonspecific findings of chronic cystitis
in the bladder. The ureter margins were negative for tumor. However
some tumor was identified attached to the left side of the bladder in
deep nerves attached seminal vesicles.
MSI testing was not ordered as this is a recurrent tumor and not a
primary tumor.
Specimen
Bladder prostate and rectum
Clinical Information
Recurrent rectal cancer. Recurrence between J-pouch and
prostate/seminal vesicles
Gross Description
Received fresh and subsequently fixed in formalin labeled ""bladder
prostate and rectum"" is a specimen which includes a 4.3 x 3.7 white 3.7
cm prostate, an 8.5 cm portion of rectum with J-pouch, attached bladder
and prostate. The bladder is approximately 6.5 x 5.5 and is 4.0 cm
inflated. There is a catheter in the prostatic urethra and the specimen
is heavily stapled. Orientation of the specimen was reviewed by the
surgeon at time of tissue procurement. No frozen sections were
requested. Proximal end of the rectum is inked blue and the distal end of the rectum is inked black. The J-pouch of the specimen is
approximately 3 x 2.5 cm and is heavily stapled, located within 2.5 cm
of the distal margin of the rectum. The mucosa of this area is smooth
and glistening showing an average circumference of 7.5 cm in its opened
state. In the J-pouch there is a 1.2 x 0.7 cm ulcer. This comes within
2.5 cm of the distal rectal margin and 6.5 cm of the proximal rectal
margin. This comes within 1.2 cm of the anastomotic line surface of
this area shows tumor present and a scarred focus. This area of the
J-pouch is adherent to the posterior right side of the prostate. This
area is inked black. The cut surface of this area shows a white tan
scarred irregular focus which is approximately 2.5 x 2.5 x 2.5 cm. The
remainder of the cut surface of the prostate is pink-tan and diffusely
nodular. The remainder of the bladder and prostate are opened in an
anterior Y-shaped incision. Mucosa the bladder is pink-tan smooth
glistening with no other discrete gross lesions identified. The ureters
are propatent an average 4.5 x 0.3 cm. The seminal vesicles cannot be
grossly identified in a variegated and behind the rectum. Vas
deferentia cannot be grossly identified. From minimal fat is gross
identified surrounding the tissue. Possible lymph nodes may be present.
Representative sections of the specimen are submitted as follows: 1 -
representative luminal margins of the rectum, 2 - 6 - entire J-pouch
ulceration and to tumor including anastomotic line (inked blue) and
possible seminal vesicle and prostatic tissue, (from proximal to

GROSS DESCRIPTION 
             A.  Received in fresh subsequently fixed in formalin 
             labeled ""rectosigmoid colon"" is a 19 cm. long portion of 
    colon which is stapled at one end (possibly proximal) inked blue and 
    the opposite end is opened and inked black. Retroperitoneal 
    reflection is located 7.5 cm. from the distal end.  The specimen is 
    otherwise covered with pink- tan, glistening serosa and abundant 
    yellow lobular fat.  The specimen is opened to show pink- tan 
    glistening mucosa with an average circumference of 5.4 cm. There is 
    a 4.5 x 3.8 x 1.0 cm. tumor coming to within 1.5 cm. from of the 
    distal margin. The cut surface of the tumor shows invasion into the 
    muscularis propria, coming to within 0.3 cm. of the radial margin. 
    This radial margin is inked orange.  No other discrete gross lesions 
    are identified.  Samples are taken for tissue procurement. Lymph 
    nodes are grossly identified in the fat, measuring up to 0.9 cm. in 
    greatest dimension.  Representative sections of the specimen are 
    submitted as follows:

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION 
             This tumor is a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma 
             with quite extensive invasion.  It extends through the 
  
  bowel wall and sends tongues of tumor into pericolonic fat and 
    incites a scirrhous reaction.  Because of the propensity to send 
    these narrow tongues of infiltrating tumor out into the fat, there 
    is minimal extension to the radial margin.  Also tumor nests are 
    present within soft tissue (blocks 11, 13).  Lymphatic invasion is 
    noted in the pericolonic soft tissue (block number 11).  Invasion of 
    an artery is also noted.  Please see the template below

hMSH6 and hPMS2 expression in the tumor (internal controls

Lynch Syndrome (also know as hereditary non-polyposis 
colorectal carcinoma or HNPCC), because some mutations may 
result in intact protein expression. In addition, 
alterations could exist in MSH3, which has not been tested. 
Finally, some hereditary colorectal cancers are caused by 
alterations in other unknown genes (familial colorectal

. , "," Based on the pathology report, here is the information organized into the six categories:

Site: The site of the cancer is the rectosigmoid colon, which is the lower end of the colon.

Laterality: Not provided, as laterality refers to the side of the body where the tumor is located, and this information was not given in the report.

Histology: The histology of the cancer is adenocarcinoma, which is a type of cancer that starts in glandular cells. This is a common type of colon cancer.

Stage: The cancer is at pTNM stage pT3 N1 M1, which indicates that the tumor has grown into the outermost layers of the colon (pT3), there are cancer cells present in nearby lymph nodes (N1), and the cancer has metastasized to other parts of the body (M1).

Grade: Not provided, as the report does not mention the grade of the cancer. Grade refers to how different the cancer cells look from normal cells and can give an indication of how quickly the cancer may grow or spread.

Behavior: The behavior of this cancer is malignant, meaning it can invade nearby tissues and spread to other parts of the body. This is indicated by the fact that the cancer has metastasized (M1).

The report also mentions that a KRAS mutation analysis will be performed, which may provide additional information about the behavior and potential treatment options for this cancer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2. pTNM stage: pT3, NX. 
COMMENTS: 
The vast majority of the sample submitted consists of 
invasive tumor. It is unclear what represents the exact 
margins in many of the sampled areas. However, where the 
margins can be clearly identified, tumor is seen at one . 
focus 0.1 cm from the inked radial margin and appears to be 
within 0.2 cm of both the proximal and distal mucosal 
margins. However, since the majority of the specimen does 
consist of tumor there is judged to be a significant risk 
that tumor is present at one of the resection margins. 
Clinical correlation is suggested.

Multiple enlarged lymph nodes without carcino ma were identified. These lymph nodes contained numerous follicles that appeare d 
reactive. However, due to the large size of th e lymph nodes, the number of fol licles, and the patient' s age, immunostains for BCL2,

Gross Description:
Specimen A is labeled ""right colon"".
Specimen fixation: Formalin
Parts of bowel received: Terminal ileum (4.1 cm long x 3.3 cm in
circumference), ascending colon (14.7 cm long x 5.7 cm in
circumference), vermiform appendix (8.1 cm long x 0.6 cm in
diameter) and attached mesentery (22.3 x 8.2 x 3.4 cm).
Measurement: Please see parts of bowel received.
Specimen integrity: Intact
Orientation: Inking: serosa overlying the cecal mass/blue,
mesenteric margin/green
Tumor location: Cecal pouch
Gross appearance of tumor: Filling the cecal pouch is a
tan/brown firm exophytic mass with well-defined rolled nodular
borders. Also within the cecal pouch adjacent to the mass but
not communicating with it is a soft tan/brown sessile polypoid
polyp.
Tumor dimensions: The mass is 5.3 x 4.1 x 1.7 cm (protruding
into the lumina) and the polyp is 2.7 x 2.3 x 1.7 cm.
Bowel circumference at tumor site: 7.7 cm
Circumferential growth: Mass and polyp occupy the entire cecal
pouch and adjacent luminal circumference involved is
approximately 60%.
Gross depth of invasion: The mass extends 0.9 cm through the
muscularis propria, into the mesentery and grossly retracts the
serosa, but does not extend through it. The polyp is confined to
the mucosal surface.
Gross evidence of perforation through visceral peritoneum: No
Luminal obstruction: The cecal pouch portion of the lumen is
completely obstructed, but the ascending colon lumen just distal
to the mass is patent. Gross distance of tumor from margins: The mass is 5.2 cm from
the proximal mucosal margin, 14.6 cm from the distal mucosal
margin, and 5.9 cm from the mesenteric margin. The polyp is 8.6
cm from the proximal margin, 14.9 cm from the distal mucosal
margin, and 8.1 cm from the mesenteric margin
Other remarkable findings: The appendix is intact, curved and
adherent within the mesentery. The serosa is purple/tan, smooth
and glistening. The lumen is pinpoint with a tan mucosa. The
appendix is uninvolved by mass and the mass is 1.8 cm from the
appendical orifice.
Lymph nodes: Multiple lymph node candidates are identified
ranging from 0.2 cm in greatest dimension up to 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.9
cm in greatest dimension.

COMMENT; • • • t • • E, 
Pa111: Multiple sections of the right colon tumor mass show a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma consisting of 
well-fermed'malignant glands. In some area, the tumor cells contain abundant mucin vacuoles with a signet·ring 
appearance. However, individual infiltrating signet~ring calls are not seen. In other areas, the tumor cells form nests or 
trabeculae with irregular to angular nuclei and visible nucleolI. Although the lat1ar component taises the possibility of 
neuroendocrine difforentiation, immunostain$ for the neuroendocrine markers synaptophysin and ciiiiiiromo ranin are both 
negative. Therefore, this tumor j:;; best characterized as moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, las 
reviowod this, easo """"? agreed with the diagnosis.

ADDENDA: ' 
Addendum 
Fluorescent in situ hybridization studies have been performed on the poorly differentiated colonic adenocarcinoma. The 
ratio of HER·21neu to the centromere of chromosome 17 is 1.70, indicating low level HER·21neu amplification in the

F. APPENDIX WITH NO SIGNIFICANT PATHOLOGIC CHANGE, 
COMMEN : 
Much of this tumor is a well differentiated adenocarcinoma, and the perieolonie lymph node metastasis from part 4 is of 
this pattern. However, some of the deeply invasive tumor is mucinous, and this pattern is present in the liver biopsy. 
Trichrome and PAS stains were performed on the liver biopsy ( part 1). The trichrome stain highlights desmoplastic 
fibrosis within the metastatic carcinoma. The PAS stain highlights Intracellular and extracellular mucin within the 
metastatic carcinoma.

Addendum 
Molecular Anatomic Pathology Te5y.'19.:... 
Block 20: 
A. KRAS codon 12113 mutation IDENTIFIED (Oly12Val). 
Noto: 
The quantity and quality of isolated DNA was acceptable for testing. 
The predictive value of KRAS mutation In colorectal cancer patients treated with cetuximab (anti.EGFR monoclonal 
antibody) chemotherapy has recently been reported 1. Mutations in the KRAS codon 12/13 gone were found to be 
associated with resistance to cetuximab therapy, worse prognosis and poor survival in patients with metastatic colorec:tal 
cancer. 1-4 However, not all tumors reveal such a correlation, therefore the presence of KRAS mutations should be 
interpreted in the context of the cytolooic and histoloQiC filidinj:iS and the patient's clinical history. 
Addendum . 
Molecular Anatomic Pathology Testing' 
BloCk 20: 
A. No microsatellite instability detected (Mlcrosatellite stable). 
Note: . . f' t II't The five NCI recommended dinucleotide and mononucleotide polymorph isms were utlllzod to assess or mlcrosa e J e 
instability {MSI) by peR None of five markers s~owed evidence of microsatellite instability. 
High-level MSI may have prognostic implications, and patiti'nts with these tumors may be at risk for Hereditary Non­
Polyposis Colorectal Carcinoma syndrome (HNPCC or Lynch Syndrome)(1~6). Genetic t~sti~g for germline mutations . 
associated with that syndrome is indicated In patients with hlgh~level MSI, after appropriate ,lnformOd consent a~d genet1c 
counseling (1). If clinical suspicion for HNPCC Is very high, genetic testing may be appropriate even In cases with

GOMMt:NT: 
The carcinoma extensively involves the colonic wall, from the mucosa to the pericolic adipose tissue, but no definite 
precursor lesion is Seen in the colonic mucosa. There is extensive, plaque·li~e extramural/subserosa I involvement as 
well, with areas of serosal penetration and at least one focus where cauterized carcinoma is present at what appears to 
be the radial andlor mesocolic specimen edge. This corresponds to the operative report describing dense tumor 
infiltrating the pelvic sidewall over the iliac vess!,ls, through whiCh the surgeon cut. In addition, immunohistochemical 
stains reveal the carcinoma to be strongly positive for cytokeratin 7 with only focal positivity for cytokeratin 20. CDX·2 is 
completely negative. as are TTF·1 and PSA. CEA and cytokeratin 19 are positive. Positive immunostains for the DNA 
mismatch repair proteins MLH-l, PMS-2, MSH·2 and MSH·6 reveal preserved nuclear expression. In summary, the overall 
morphological findings and immunohistochemical profile are not typical of a primary colorectal adenocarcinoma. A 
possible primary site compatible with the immunomorphologlcal findings is the pancreaticobiliary system. Alternatively, 
if another potential primary site cannot be found clinically, this could be a primary peritoneal adenocarcinoma with 
extension into the colonic wall. Finally, the lymph node total includes one lymph node confirmed to be negative for 
carcinoma by a negative cytokeratin AE1/AE3 immunos!ain. "," 1. ""Site"": Sigmoid colon, as it's the location where the resection was performed and the cancer was found.

Nueiear Grade "," Based on the given microscopic description, here is the information categorized under Site, Laterality, Histology, Stage, Grade, and Behavior:

1. Site: The site is not explicitly mentioned in the description, but based on the mention of alveolar formation, it could be a lung or breast tissue. However, without more context, this cannot be confirmed.
2. Laterality: The laterality of the tumor is also not provided in the description.
3. Histology: The tumor shows features of sarcomatous differentiation, with round and spindle cells present. There is also mention of keratin secretion, suggesting squamous differentiation. Therefore, the histological type could be a carcinosarcoma or a mixed malignant tumor with both epithelial and mesenchymal components.
4. Stage: The stage of the tumor is not explicitly mentioned in the description, but based on the presence of necrosis, lymphocytic infiltration, vascular invasion, and fibrosis, it is likely to be an advanced-stage tumor.
5. Grade: Based on the mention of nuclear atypia, hyperchromatism, and mitotic activity, the tumor appears to be high grade (III).
6. Behavior: The behavior of the tumor is malignant, as indicated by its invasive features and high-grade morphology.

In summary, based on the microscopic description provided, the tumor is likely to be a high-grade carcinosarcoma or mixed malignant tumor located in the lung or breast, with advanced stage and malignant behavior. However, without more context and clinical information, this interpretation should be considered preliminary.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

STAFF FOR RESEARCH USE ONLY). "," Based on the given pathology report, the relevant categories with available information are:

Site: The tissue sample is from a distant metastasis; however, the primary site or organ is not specified in the report.

Laterality: The report does not mention whether the metastasis is on the left or right side of the body.

Histology: The histological diagnosis is not explicitly stated in the report, but there are descriptions of various cell types and structures, such as squamous cells, glandular cells, spindle cells, and mosaic pattern, among others.

Stage: The pathological staging is provided as pT y N0 M0, which indicates that the tumor (T) is limited to its original location without invasion into nearby structures (pT y), there are no cancer cells in nearby lymph nodes (N0), and there are no distant metastases (M0).

Grade: The report does not provide a clear nuclear grade or differentiation grade for the tumor. However, it mentions some features suggestive of higher-grade malignancy, such as aniso nucleosis, hyperchromatism, and mitotic activity.

Behavior: Based on the available information, the behavior of this tumor is likely to be malignant, given its metastatic nature and some high-grade features. However, a definitive assessment cannot be made without more complete information.

In summary, the report provides limited information for categorizing the tumor's site, laterality, histology, stage, grade, and behavior. Further investigation and testing are required to make a comprehensive diagnosis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

III "," Based on the pathology report fragment provided, the six categories with available or inferred information are:

1. Site: Not explicitly mentioned but can be inferred as a primary tumor in an organ (based on the 'Primary Tumor' section).
2. Laterality: Also not provided in the fragment.
3. Histology: Diffuse cell distribution with mosaic, storiform, and clusterized patterns; squamous, glandular, round, lymphomatous, spindle cells; keratin secretion; and other features can be found (based on the 'Primary Tumor' section).
4. Stage: Pathological staging is given as pT3 N0 M0, which corresponds to a primary tumor invading beyond the subserosa or into nearby organs/structures without regional lymph node metastasis and no distant metastasis.
5. Grade: Not explicitly mentioned in the fragment; however, nuclear atypia is described as ""Nuclear Atypia: 0 I II III"" which could be used to infer a grade if more information was provided.
6. Behavior: The behavior of this tumor cannot be definitively classified based on the given fragment.

Justification: The interpretation is based on extracting relevant details from various sections of the pathology report, including 'Primary Tumor', 'Pathological Staging', and 'Microscopic Description'. However, many crucial pieces of information are missing or incomplete, making it challenging to provide a comprehensive assessment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
