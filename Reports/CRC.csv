Microsatellite instability is not detected in the carcinoma by immunohistochemistry ;therefore ,the likelihood that the
carcinoma is due to sporadic or hereditary (i.e.: Lynch syndrome -associated )defective DNA mismatch repair is very low.
However ,immunohistochemistry may not detect rare polymorphisms or missense mutations in DNA mismatch repair proteins
in up to 10% of cases .If strong clinical suspicion persists, additional testing is suggested.
Archived slides and paraffin blocks were reviewed for case block Al0 containing normal tissue and carcinoma was selected for MSI analysis.
Irnmamohistochemical studies were performed on formalin fixed ,paraffin -embedded tissue with adequate positive and negative control sections, including internal
positive control tissue.
The performance characteristics of these antibodies were determined by the _
They have not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration .The FDA has
determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary .These tests are used for clinical purposes .They should not be regarded as investigational or for research.
This laboratory is certified under the Cli nical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA- 88) as qualified to perform high -complexity clinical laboratory
testing.

findings indicate an intact mismatch repair (MMR) gene function without evidence of significant microsatellite instability (MSI).
Although these findings make the diagnosis of hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer (HNPCC) or Lynch Syndrome very unlikely

SPECIMEN (S) SUBMITTED :GROSS DESCRIPTION
Right colon: In formalin labeled ""right colon"" is a 25 cm in length segment of cecum and right colon with an attached 20 cm of
terminal ileum and a 6 cm attached appendix. Within the right colon there is a 4.2 x 4 cm endophytic tumor with raised rolled
borders. This tumor is 9 cm from the distal margin and 24.5 cm from the proximal margin. The tumor invades into and through
the bowel wall into the pericolonic fat and is grossly 3 cm from the circumferential soft tissue margin. The tumor also appears to
near the serosa/peritonealized surface of the attached fat. There is an additional 4 x 3 cm polypoid mass 4.5 cm from the distal
margin and 29 cm from the proximal margin. The mucosa and wall adjacent to this mass is ragged, disrupted and hemorrhagic
with hemorrhage and necrosis in the surrounding pericoloic soft tissues. No gross invasion beyond the wall is noted and this
mass is 6 cm from the circumferential soft tissue margin. Within the cecum there is an additional 4.5 x 2.7 x 1.8 cm exophytic
polypoid mass. This mass is 17 cm from the distal margin and 22 cm from the proximal margin. Again, no invasion through the
wall is noted and the mass is 9 cm from the circumferential soft tissue margin. The remaining colonic mucosa is tan-pink with
several additional smaller, up to 0.6 cm, mucosal polyps and focal areas of congestion. The ileal mucosa is tan-pink with a few
polypoid projections and a 2.3 x 1.3 cm flat granular area 6 cm from the proximal margin and 27 cm from the distal margin. No
invasion into the mesenteric fat is noted and the lesion is 3.5 cm from the mesenteric resection margin. The cut surfaces of the
appendix display a lumen lined by congested mucosa. Multiple lymph nodes are identified in the attached fat. Representative
sections are submitted as labeled: A-C tumor in ascending colon to pericolonic fat and serosal/peritonealized surface; D-E distal
ascending colon polypoid mass with adjacent ragged hemorrhagic disrupted area; F-G cecal polypoid mass; H smaller colonic
mucosal polyps; I flat and granular irregular area in small bowel; J small bowel mucosa with small polypoid projections; K distal
margin and en face circumferential soft tissue margin; L proximal margin and appendix; M six lymph nodes; N six lymph nodes;
0 six lymph nodes; P six lymph nodes.

microscopic Exam ination
Microscopic examination is performed. Within part A, the fallopian tube
fimbria demonstrates a focal area of mild cytologic atypic.
Immunohistochemistry of this area (block Al) reveals weak/low cytokeratin 7,
p53 and Ki67 expression. Cytokeratin 20, Pax8 and CDX2 are negative. In
comparison, the tumor present in the colon demonstrates strong cytokeratin 20
and CDX2 expression and is negative for Pax8, p53, and cytokeratin 7. Ki6'7 is
moderately elevated. Overall, the findings in the fallopian tube are felt to
be secondary to cautery artifact. Dr. has reviewed parts of this case
and concurs with the interpretation.

consisting of 6 em. of terminal ileum \·lith 50 em of contiguous 
colon. There is a 30 x 11 x 1 em. portion of omentum which is 
adherent to the outer aspect of the colon wall over an area 6 x 5 
em, with induration of the omentum in that area. The serosal 
surface 
the of the bowel away from where the omentum is attached is glistening 
and tan-pink. No appendix is present with the specimen. The bm·1el 
is opened. The small bowel averages 4.5 em. in circumference and 
colon averages 8.5 em. in circumference. The mucosa of the small 
bowel is tan-pink, smooth, and glistening, with a normal pattern of 
folds. There are no focal lesions in the small bowel. The colon is 
notable for a circumferential mass, with the bowel 12 em. in 
circumference in this region, with this mass 9 em. long and 
maximally 1.2 em. thick. Sectioning through the mass reveals the 
tumor to invade through the bowel wall into fat in the region with 
adherent omentum noted above, appearing to involve the omentum. The 
tumor comes very near to1 but does not clearly reach1 the outer 
margin. The tumor is 24 ern. from the distal resection margin. The

 GROSS DESCRIPTION 
             A.  Received fresh subsequently fixed in formalin labeled              ""sigmoid, upper rectum with adherent posterior bladder 
wall 
    and small intestines"".  The specimen consists of a rectosigmoid 
    colon with adherent portions of small bowel and possible portion of 
    bladder.  A segment of small bowel was 12 cm long, stapled at both     ends, which are arbitrarily inked blue and black.  A portion of 
    colon is 46 cm long.  Both ends are stapled, inked blue and the 
    opposite is opened and is inked black.  There is also a small 
    portion of possible bladder, which is 7 x 5 cm.  This is smooth to 
    slightly velvety and the margin of this is inked blue.  Orientation     cannot be determined.  One end away from the tumor is inked blue. 
    The opposite end close to the tumor is inked black.  The specimen 
is     opened to show a large fungating mass, which is 12 x 11.5 x 3.5 cm. 
    This comes within 2.5 cm of the black inked margin.  This tumor is     centrally necrotic and goes through the wall of the colon, into the 
    surrounding fat and through the wall of the small bowel into the 
    mucosa of the small bowel.  The remainder of the mucosa of small 
    bowel is pink- tan smooth glistening with normal slightly dilated 
    poles having an average circumference of 6.5 cm and the mucosal 
    alteration of tumor is 3.5 x 3.5 cm.  This comes within equidistant 
    luminal margins of the small bowel.  The tumor also comes through 
    the wall into the fat and possibly involves the mucosa of the 
    portion of bladder.  This is velvety, coming within 0.5 cm of the 
    nearest peripheral margin.  The remainder of the mucosa of the     specimen is pink- tan smooth glistening with an average 
circumference                                        of 9.5 cm.  The tumor comes within 1.5 cm of being circumferential 
    and shows a markedly necrotic central focus.  Lymph nodes are 
    grossly identified.  Representative sections of the specimen are     submitted as follows: 
 
    BLOCK SUMMARY:  1 - Representative luminal margins of small bowel, 
2     - representative section of small bowel tumor, 3- 4 - representative 
    section of bladder to tumor, 5 - representative luminal margins of

           B.  Received in formalin labelled ""appendix"" is a 6.3 x 0.7 
cm           appendix 
    which is partially covered with pink- tan smooth glistening serosa 
    and yellow 
    lobular fat.  The specimen is sectioned to show an intact wall with 
    an average thickness of 0.4 cm.  The lumen ranges from pinpoint to 
    0.4 cm and shows 
    possible diverticula present.  No other discrete gross lesions are 
    identified.  The entire specimen with the exception of the fat is     submitted in t settes.  AS- 2 (fat retained), proximal end 
    inked.  AS- 2.  
 
     
 
MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION 
    A. Microscopic exam of the resection shows: 
    Histologic type:  Adenocarcinoma, not otherwise specified 
     Histologic grade:  Moderately differentiated 
    Primary tumor(pT):  Tumor invades through the entire colonic wall     and through the entire adhesed small intestinal wall into the lumen 
     of the small intestine.  The tumor also invades into the 
muscularis 
     propria of the bladder wall (pT4b). 
     Proximal margin:  Negative for tumor.      Distal margin:  Negative for tumor. 
     Circumferential (radial) margin:  Negative for tumor although not 
     truly applicable given the resection of the adhered additional 
      organs. 
     Distance of tumor from closest margin:  2.5 from one of the colonic 
     margins 
     Vascular invasion:  Not identified. 
     Regional lymph nodes (pN): 30 lymph nodes are dissected from the 
     specimen and they are all negative for metastatic (pN0).      Non- lymph node pericolonic tumor:  Present in the soft tissue 
     adhesing the small intestine and the bladder to the upper       rectal/sigmoid colon resection.  No discrete additional nodules 
of 
      
 
 
   
  
 
  pericolonic tumor seen. 
     Distant metastasis (pM):  Cannot evaluate pMX. 
     Other findings:  There is significant necrosis of the tumor in the 
     central areas.              B. Microscopic examination of the appendix reveals a 
benign 
             mucocele at the tip.  No dysplasia or malignancy is 
    identified.  There is focal fibrous obliteration of the tip 
    including obliteration of the diverticulum. There is acute serositis 
    and ahdesions.

 GROSS DESCRIPTION 
             A.  Received in formalin labeled ""apical lymph node"" is a 
             0.8 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm yellow fatty tissue fragment which may     be possible lymphoid tissue. The tissue is entirely submitted in 
one 
    cassette.   
             B. eived fresh subsequently fixed in formalin labeled              ""sigmoid and upper rectum"".  The specimen grossly consists     of a 20- cm long portion of colon which is stapled at the distal end 
    (inked black) and opened at the proximal end (inked blue).  The     serosa of the specimen is pink- tan smooth and glistening partially 
    covered with abundant yellow lobular fat. Retroperitoneal reflection     is located 6 cm from the distal margin.  The specimen is opened to 
    show a pink- tan smooth glistening mucosa with an average 
    circumference of 5.5 cm.  There is a large exophytic tumor closer 
to 
    the distal end, measuring 5.3 x 6.0 x 1.0 cm.  This is located 3.5     cm from the distal end.  The distal end has a circumference of 7.5 
    cm and the tumor comes within 0.6 cm of being circumferential.  The 
    cut surface of the tumor shows invasion into the muscularis 
propria. 
    However, no discrete invasion is grossly identified into the fat.     This comes within 2.5 cm of the radial margin. A sample was taken 
    for tissure procurement.  The remainder of the mucosa is pink- tan 
    smooth and glistening with normal to slightly dilated folds.  No     other discrete gross lesions are identified in the mucosa. Multiple 
    lymph nodes are grossly identified in the fat which are firm and     somewhat enlarged up to 1.7 cm in greatest dimension. 
    Representative sections of the specimen are submitted as follows: 
    Block 1 - representative luminal margin; block 2- 4 - representative 
    section of tumor which includes tumor to normal and tumor into fat;     block 5 - representative radial margin; block 6 - one possible

GROSS DESCRIPTION 
             Received fresh in a container labeled ""right hemicolectomy"" 
             is a segment of bowel consisting of 6 cm of terminal ileum 
    with contiguous 23 cm of proximal colon.  The serosal surface is 
    glistening and tan- pink, and there is a moderate amount of attached 
    adipose tissue.  There is an unremarkable appendix present, 
    measuring 6.5 cm long x 0.7 cm in diameter.  On cut surface, it is 
    without focal lesion, without gross evidence of inflammation. The 
    bowel measures 3.6 cm and 8 cm in circumference at the proximal and 
    distal resection margins respectively.  The bowel is opened, and 
    there is a circumscribed 5.3 x 5 cm rubbery white- pink mass located 
    11 cm proximal to the distal margin.  A portion of tumor and of 
    normal tissue are submitted for tissue procurement per the clinical 
    requested.  On sectioning, the tumor has a maximum thickness of 1.6 
    cm, and grossly extends through the musuclaris propria and into 
    surrounding adipose tissue.  It is 1 cm from the outer surface of 
    the specimen.  The remainder of the bowel wall averages 0.5 cm thick 
    and has a tan- pink glistening mucosa with a normal pattern and 
    folds. The adipose tissue is dissected, and soft tan lymph nodes are 
    identified up to 1.8 cm in greatest dimension.  RS- 17, following

GROSS DESCRIPTION 
             Received fresh for tissue procurement labeled ""right 
             hemicolectomy with en bloc"" is a previously unopened, 24 cm 
    segment of proximal right colon with attached 17 cm of distal ileum 
    surfaced by smooth to scabrous tan- pink serosa with a moderate 
    amount of attached mesocolon, mesentery and unremarkable omentum. 
    An irregular 5 x 5 x 2.5 cm fragment of red- brown skeletal muscle is 
    present in the vicinity of the cecal pouch.  The cauterized surface 
    of the portion of abdominal wall is inked blue (representing true 
    surgical resection margin in that area).  A scant amount of adherent 
    omentum and retracted serosal surface are also present in the 
    vicinity of the attached portion of abdominal wall (subsequently 
    inked orange and representing the free radial serosal surface).  An 
    unremarkable 7.2 cm in length, 0.9 cm in diameter appendix is 
    present.  The proximal and distal margins measure 4 and 8 cm in 
    circumference respectively.  On opening, there is a nearly 
    circumferential rubbery tan- white tumor mass at the ileocecal valve 
    measuring 11.0 x 5.7 cm.  On sectioning, the tumor has a maximal 
    thickness of 2.8 cm, grossly extending into the muscularis to within 
    0.5 cm of the inked cauterized resection margin (abdominal wall) 
    (see paired contiguous sections blocks 2&3 and 4&5) and within 0.6 
    cm of the inked free radial serosal surface (see bisected contiguous 
    sections block 6 and 7).  The ileal and remaining colonic mucosa is 
    unremarkable glistening tan- pink with regular folds and the walls 
    average 0.4 cm in thickness.  Two palpable rubbery tan- pink-red 
    apical lymph nodes averaging 1.3 cm in greatest dimension are 
    recovered from the attached mesocolon.  Numerous additional rubbery 
    pale tan lymph nodes, 2.8 cm in greatest dimension, are recovered 
    from the remainder of the mesocolon and mesentery.  A portion of 
    tumor and a portion of normal mucosa are submitted for tissue 
    procurement as requeste  presentative sections are submitted in 
    25 blocks as labeled.  -

             Received fresh labeled ""right colon"" is a previously 
             unopened 30 cm.  segment of proximal right colon with 
    attached 8 cm. of distal ileum surfaced by smooth tan pink serosa 
    with a copious amount of attached, mesocolon, mesentery, and 
    unremarkable omentum.  No appendix is identified.  The proximal and 
    distal margins measure 4.0 and 8.0 cm. in circumference 
    respectively.  On opening, there is a moderately well circumscribed, 
    4.5 x 3.8 cm. rubbery tan white- pink tumor mass located 9 cm. distal 
    to the ileocecal valve.  A portion of tumor and a portion of normal 
    mucosa are submitted for tissue procurement as requested.  On 
    sectioning, the tumor has a maximal thickness of 1.8 cm., grossly 
    extending into the muscularis to within 0.6 cm. of the inked free 
    radial serosal surface. A few soft tan ink polypoid lesions 
    measuring up to 0.6 cm. in greatest dimension are present throughout 
    the remainder of the colon.  The ileal and remaining colonic mucosa 
    is unremarkable, glistening tan pink with regular folds and the 
    walls average 0.5 cm. in thickness.  Multiple soft to slightly 
    rubbery pale tan to tan- red tissues in keeping with lymph nodes 
    measuring up to 1.2 cm. in greatest dimension are recovered from the 
    attached mesocolon and mesentery.  Representative sections are 
    submitted in 15 blocks as labeled.  RS- 15. 
 
    BLOCK SUMMARY:  1 - Proximal and distal margins; 2, 3 - tumor full 
    thickness to inked free radial serosal surface; 4 - central tumor; 5 
    - tumor to normal mucosa; 6, 7 - colonic polyps; 8 - ICV; 9 - random 
    colon; 10- 12 - six whole lymph nod per cassette; 13- 15 - one

GROSS DESCRIPTION 
             A. Received fresh in a container labeled ""colon"" is a 
             segment of colon 23 cm long.  The specimen is received open 
    at both ends, which are arbitrarily inked blue and black.  The 
    serosal surface is tan- pink and glistening.  There is abundant 
    attached yellow adipose tissue.  There is also abundant omentum 
    present, 42 x 5 x 3 cm in greatest dimensions.  The omentum is 
    serially sectioned, and there are no focal lesions.  The segment of 
    bowel is opened.  It averages 6.5 cm in circumference.  5.5 cm from 
    the black- inked end of the specimen, there is a 5.5 x 5 x 3.8 cm 
    tumor mass.  On cut surface, this tumor grossly invades into, and 
    apparently through, the muscularis propria, into surrounding soft 
    tissues.  Although extending near to the serosal surface, tumor does 
    not appear to reach the serosal surface, and is not near the radial 
    margin.  The surface deep to the tumor is inked.  3.5 cm from the 
    blue- inked margin is a separate 3.5 x 3.3 x 2.7 cm polypoid lesion. 
    There is some black tattooing in this region.  On cut surface, the 
    polypoid lesion is exophytic, without definite gross invasion into 
    the bowel wall.  The specimen away from the lesions has a tan- pink 
    glistening mucosa and tan wall.  The adipose tissue is dissected, 
    and multiple tan lymph nodes are identified. RS- 22, following 
    fixation. 
 
    BLOCK SUMMARY:  A1,A2 - omentum; A3 - proximal and distal resection 
    margins; A4- A7 - invasive tumor mass, with one lymph node also 
    included in block A7; A8- A16 - entire polypoid lesion; A17- A22 - 
    lymph nodes. 
 
             B.  Received fresh in a container labeled ""B - small bowel 
             mass"" is a portion of tan tissue with mucosa along one 
    surface, 3 x 2 cm, and 0.3 cm deep, compatible with small bowel.  On 
    the serosal surface there is a tan- white plaque-l ike area, 0.8 x 0.5 
    x 0.1 cm.  A section is submitted for frozen section, including the 
    plaque- like area, and the remainder of the specimen is entirely 
    submitted for permanent sections in three additional blocks. 
             C.  Received in formalin in a container labeled ""appendix"" 
             is a 5.5 cm long x 0.7 cm in diameter appendix.  It is 
    grossly unremarkable, with a tan- pink glistening serosal surface, 
     wall, and tan mucosa.  There are no focal lesions.  AS- 1.

GROSS DESCRIPTION 
             A.  Received fresh in a container labeled ""sigmoid colon"" 
             is a 24 cm long segment of colon, which is received open at 
    one end, which is inked black black, and which is stapled at the 
    opposite end, which is inked blue.  It is 5 cm in circumference at 
    the open end of the specimen, and 9 cm in circumference at the 
    stapled end of the specimen.  The serosal surface is generally 
    tan- pink and glistening, with an area with tattoo pigmented 11 cm 
    from the open end of the specimen.  There is a palpable mass within 
    the bowel in this area, although there is not gross tumor 
    penetration to the serosal surface.  The specimen is opened, 
    revealing a near circumferential 7.5 x 6.5 x 1.5 cm mass lesion, 
    coming to within 4.5 cm of the open end of the specimen.  On cut 
    suface, there is invasion of tumor through the full thickness of the 
    bowel wall and into the surrounding adipose tissue, but the tumor is 
    not near the radial margin.  The mucosa away from this area is area 
    is tan- pink and glistening, with multiple polyps, ranging from 0.3 
    cm to 0.7 cm in greatest dimension.  There is no other worrisome 
    lesion in the bowel.  The adipose tissue is dissected, and multiple 
    soft tan- pink lymph nodes are identified.  RS- 16, according to the 
    accompanying block summary, following fixation. 
 
    BLOCK SUMMARY:  A1 - proximal and distal resection margins; A2- A6 - 
    polyps; A7 - radial margin; A8- A10 - tumor; A11- A15 - lymph nodes, 
    h multiple lymph nodes per block; A16 - one sectioned lymph node. 
     
 
             B.  Received fresh in a container labeled ""segment for 
             liver lesion"" is a wedge- shaped portion of tissue, with a 
    generally tan glistening capsular surface, but with an area of 
    tan- white discoloration on the capsular surface, and with the 
    non- capsular surface of the biopsy irregulary roughened and 
    cauterized.  The specimen spans an area 2 x 1.5 x 1.1 cm.  On cut 
    surface there is a nodular area approximately 0.6 cm in greatest 
    extent in the subcapsular region, corresponding to the discoloraton 
    noted on the capsular surface.  Two sections are submitted for 
    frozen section, with the apparent lesion in block BFS1, and the 
    remainder of the specimen is submitted for permanent sections one 
    additional block.

    hemicolectomy"" is a 28 cm. long portion of colon.  The specimen is 
    open at  both ends, arbitrarily inked blue and black.  There is 
    pink- tan smooth glistening serosa.  The peritoneal reflections 
    cannot be grossly identified.  The specimen shows an umbilication 
    midway through the specimen. This area of umbilication is inked 
    orange.  The specimen is opened to show a pink- tan smooth, 
    glistening mucosa with normal to abundant folds with an average 
    circumference of 5 cm.  Located near the umbilication is a 4.8 x 4.0 
    cm.  circumferential ulcerated lesion.  The cut surface of this 
    lesion shows invasion into the muscularis propria, coming within 7.5 
    cm. of the radial margin, contiguous with the umbilication 
    previously described.  The cut surface shows multiple diverticula 
    present.  No discrete gross evidence of submucosal abscess or 
    perforation identified.  There is a firm nodule in the fatty tissue 
    on cut surface it is grossly consistent with a diverticula 
    containing firm formed fecal material.  No other discrete gross 
    lesions identified. Multiple lymph nodes are grossly identified. 
    Representative sections of the specimen are submitted as follows:

GROSS DESCRIPTION
A.Received fresh, subsequently fixed in formalin, labeled
""sigmoid colon"". The specimen consists of a 22 cm. long
portion of colon which is stapled at the proximal end, opened at the
distal end. The proximal end is inked blue and the distal end is
inked black. The specimen is opened to show a pink tan smooth
glistening mucosa with normal to abundant folds. The circumference
of the proximal end is 4.5 cm. and the circumference at the distal
end is 7.5 cm. The specimen shows a 4.8 x 3.5 x 1 cm. tumor which
comes within 5 cm. of the distal margin. The serosa of the specimen
is pink tan smooth glistening and predominantly covered with yellow
lobular fat. The specimen shows a 2.5 x 1.5 cm. serosal
umbilication. This umbilication is inked blue. The tumor also shows
gross invasion through the muscularis propria into the fat. Multiple
lymph nodes are grossly identified in the surrounding fat. There is
a focus of mesenteric margin (peduncle) which feels somewhat
indurated. The proximal lymph node may be present in this area.
There is also a 1.5 x 1.5 irregular indurated focus on the surface
coming in within 9 cm. of the proximal margin. The cut surface of
this induration site shows possible tumor present. There is also a
small polyp grossly identified which is 0.5 cm. this is located 3
cm. from the distal margin. This polyp shows no invasion grossly
identified. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted
for tissue procurement. Representative sections of the remainder of
the specimen are submitted as follows:
BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 - Representative luminal margins; 2 - mesenteric
margin shave; 3 - polyp full thickness; 4 - tumor to serosal
umbilication; 5 - tumor to normal; 6 - tumor to fat; 7 - radial
margin; 8 - indurated surface nodule with possible tumor; 9-12 -
nine possible lymph nodes each; 13 - four possible lymph node; 14 -
lymph node at mesenteric peduncle bisected; 15 - rPnresentative
section of possible mottled lymph node. RS15
B.Received in formalin labeled ""appendix"" is a 6 x 0.5
cm.unremarkable appendix partially covered with pink tan
smooth glistening serosa and yellow lobular fat. The specimen is
sectioned to show an intact wall with an average thickness of 0.3
cm. The lumen ranges from pinpoint to 0.??. Representative sections
of the specimen are submitted in one cassette with the proximal end
inked. RS1
MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
Microscopic sections of the sigmoid tumor reveals a
moderate to poorly differentiated colonic adenocarcinoma
which has extended through the bowel wall into the mesenteric fat. The area of irregular indurated soft tissue at the mesenteric root
does not contain any carcinoma. There are three positive mesenteric
lymph nodes present. One of these is present at the mesenteric root
and represents the most proximal lymph node in the dissection.
There is a soft tissue metastasis present in the mesentery as well.
The results of the evaluation of the resection are summarized in the
following template.
Histologic type: Adenocarcinoma.
Histologic grade: Moderate to poorly differentiated.
Primary tumor (pT): Tumor invades through the colon wall into the
mesenteric fat (pT3).

CLINICAL NOTES
GROSS DESCRIPTION
A.Received fresh, then fixed in formalin, labeled
""sigmoid colon"", is an 18 cm. long portion of colon, opened
at one end (inked blue) and stapled at the opposite end (inked
black). The specimen is partially covered with pink-tan, smooth and
glistening serosa. Externally, there is a focus of adhesions, 4 x 3
cm., located 3.5 cm. from the nearest luminal margin (inked black).
The mucosa is pink-tan, smooth and glistening, with normal to
abundant folds, and average circumference of 6 cm. There is a 4 x
3.5 cm. ulcerated tumor, 3.5 cm. from the nearest luminal margin
(inked black), and contiguous with the focus of serosal adhesions.
This focus of adhesion is inked blue. The tumor shows gross
invasion into the muscularis propria, and appears to penetrate
through the fat, to within 0.3 cm. of the surgical margin of the
adhesion. The focus of the radial margin is grossly unremarkable.
The remainder of the mucosa is pink-tan, smooth and glistening, with
two polypoid lesions, 0.3 cm. in greatest dimension, located within
2 cm. of the black inked margin and 5.5 cm. of the blue inked
margin. These show no gross invasion. Lymph nodes are identified
in the fat. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted as
follows:

Transverse colon cancer with clinical obstruction Gross Description
Received fresh labeled ""right hemicolectomy"" is a previously unopened
40 cm segment of proximal right colon with attached 15 cm of distal
ileum and an abundant amount of attached mesocolon, mesentery, and
omentum. An unremarkable 9 cm appendix averaging 0.5 cm in diameter is
present. The proximal and distal margins measure 5.2 and 7.8 cm in
circumference respectively. On opening, there is a circumferential,
6.0 x 3.9 cm rubbery tan-white-red tumor mass which is 8 cm from the
distal margin. On sectioning, the tumor has a maximal thickness of 2
cm, grossly extending through the muscularis and into the attached
mesocolon. The tumor is present within 0.2 cm of the inked free radial
serosal surface and visually appears to extend into the attached
omentum. A 3 cm in greatest dimension area of tan red discoloration is
noted within the distal ileum, 5 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve.
The remaining ileal and colonic mucosa is unremarkable tan-pink with
regular folds and the walls average 0.5 cm. A portion of tumor and a
portion of normal colonic mucosa are submitted for tissue procurement
as requested. Multiple soft to slightly rubbery tan-pink tissues in

Diagnosis:
1.: Tumor-free lipomatous atrophic lymph node.
2.: Right hemicolectomy specimen with tumor-free resection margins and under inclusion
of an ulcerated, malignant, solid tumor in the cecum, conforming to the type of a poorly
differentiated adenocarcinoma, with infiltration of the lamina muscularis propria and
without regional lymph node metastases (G3, pT2 LO VO RO pNO 0/27).
Additional immunohistological investigations are being conducted due to the histological
peculiarities of the tumor. A follow-up report on this will be submitted at a later date.
Follow-up report:
From an immunohistological perspective ,the tumor cells were positive for broad-
spectrum cytokeratins .Large numbers of CD3- positive and CD20-negative or T-
lymphocytes are also interspersed.
Based on the histology and immunohistology ,this is thus a poorly differentiated
colorectal adenocarcinoma ,or cecum carcinoma ,with a dense lymphocytic stromal
infiltrate.
The poor tumor differentiation and the dense lymphocytic inflammatory infiltration may
be indicators of the presence of a microsatellite unstable (possibly HNPCC- associated)
colorectal carcinoma.

The unusual appearance of the pericolic lymph nodes based on microscopic examination
leads to the question of whether there are clinical indications for a lymphatic leukemia.,If
CLL has not been diagnosed, then we request to be informed accordingly so that the

Diagnosis:
1.: Tumor-free lymph node (from the mesenteric root).
2.: Resectate of the transverse colon with tumor-free oral and aboral resection margins
and under inclusion of a locally advanced, ulcerated, poorly differentiated
adenocarcinoma with penetration of all layers of the wall, with infiltration of the
perimuscular fatty tissue and the neighboring omentum, with invasion of the stomach
wall and without regional lymph node metastases (G3, pT4 LO VO RO pNO 0/45).
3.: Tumor-free spleen with fresh (iatrogenic) defects to the capsule.
As requested, a paraffin block of the material was sent to Prof. for
further analyses to exclude or demonstrate the presence of an HNPCC situation. A
follow-up report on this will be submitted at a later date.
Follow-up report:
Based on the findings described in the enclosed copy of the consultation report that has
now arrived, Prof. (Pathology, finds no further indications of the
presence of an hereditary predisposition to the spectrum of tumors within the HNPCC /
Lynch Syndrome.

This is a (mainly still) moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma in the cecum
(developed in a tubulovillous adenoma) with histopathological differentiation grade G 2,
with necroses, with tumor infiltration of the wall layers of the colon as far as into the
tunica muscularis, with substantial chronic granulating and recidivist periturnoral
inflammation with an acute inflammatory phase characterized by partially purulent
abscess formation, with inflammatory adhesions between the walls of the cecum and the
ascending colon, with inflammatory adhesions between the external surface of the tumor
and the associated omental fat tissue (in 11), with a chronic inflammation in the pelvic
wall (in 1), as well as with chronic lymphadenitis in the regional lymph nodes with small
focal epithelioid cell reactions and with structured and unstructured giant cells in
individual regional lymph nodes (in II). Furthermore, overview sections taken from the
resection margins are tumor-free and there is a chronic recurrent appendicitis and chronic
granulating and recurrent periappendicitis (in 11). Based on the sections under

Diagnosis:
•The material in I is a partial resection of small intestine with reactive lesions,
The material in 11 is a preparation of the rectosigmoid colon (in clinical terms attributable
to the rectum or the sigmoid colon) with a poorly differentiated carcinoma in the area of the
rectosigmoid junction (G3), with infiltration of blood and lymph vessels (L1, V 1) and a
lymph node metastasis (pN 1).
Locally, the lesion was completely removed.
The distance from the mesorectal fascia was at least 1 cm.
The overall clinical findings and the topography should serve to determine whether this is a
rectal carcinoma in the narrower sense of the term or a carcinoma of the sigmoid colon.

The report describes two separate adenocarcinoma tumors, one located in the cecum and the other at the hepatic flexure in the ascending colon.

Laterality: Not provided
The laterality of the tumors is not explicitly mentioned in the report.

Histology: Adenocarcinoma
The report clearly indicates that both tumors are adenocarcinomas, which is a type of cancer that begins in the glandular cells lining the inside of an organ.

Stage: pT3N1b
Based on the information provided in the report, both tumors have invaded through the muscularis propria into pericolorectal tissues (pT3) and have metastasized to 2-3 regional lymph nodes (N1b).

Grade: High-grade and low-grade
The cecum tumor is described as high-grade, indicating that it is poorly differentiated and more aggressive. The hepatic flexure tumor is described as low-grade, meaning that it is well to moderately differentiated and less aggressive.

Behavior: Malignant
As the report describes two adenocarcinoma tumors with invasive characteristics, the behavior of these tumors is malignant.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

~~~~ GROSS DESCRIPTION: =~~~~~~~=~~~~~~~~~~~ 
The specimen consists of a segment of terminal ileum, cecum, appendix and 
ascending colon with attached mesocolon and omentum. Multiple adhesions are 
seen on the surface of the specimen. The terminal ileum measures 
approximately 7.0 x 3.0 cm. The colonic and cecal segment measures 15.0 x 2.5 
cm. An area of induration and puckering is evident on the anterior aspect 
just above what appears to be ileocecal valve. Opening the colon reveals a 
large fungating ulcerated mass measuring approximately 8.0 x 9.0 cm involving 
the full circumference of the colon. It has a central area of ulceration and 
raised irregular erythematous edges. The appendix is dilated and measures 4.0 
DESCRIPTION: ~~~~~~~~=~~~~~ 
Sections through the tumor demonstrate a variable pattern. In areas, it 
consists of atypical glandular structures formed by cells with irregular and 
hyperchromatic nuclei. Additionally, areas consist of poorly differentiated 
tumor. Here, the cells form solids nests and cords of spindle and polygonal 
shaped cells without gland formation. The tumor invades the muscularis from 
an ulcerated mucosal surface and extends into serosal tissues where it is 
surrounded by a desmoplastic reaction. Sections through sixteen lymph nodes 
disclose lymphoid hyperplasia and reactive changes, but no metastatic tumor. 
The resection margins are free of tumor as well. The serosal surfaces of the

Gross Description: '''::('<=''/<=D DATE: REPORT 
Container labeled ""!!I!~~~~~~'- right colon"" is an 
approximately 14 cm previously opened moderately distorted portion 
of large bowel including cecum, as well as 4.5 cm of previously 
opened terminal ileum. The specimen is covered by a moderate amount 
of pericolic and epiploic adipose tissue in which a 4.3 x 0.6 x 0.6 
grossly unremarkable vermiform appendix is identified. The visible 
serosa is shaggy and gray-brown with several fibrofatty adhesions. 
The wall is up to 0.6 cm edematous and fibrotic. The lumen is lined 
by gray-tan mucosa with preservation of intestinal folds and a small 
amount of submucosal edema. Noted within the cecal pouch at a point 
0.3 cm from the ileocecal valve there is a previously sectioned 
moderately distorted fairly well defined approximately 3.0 x 2.8 cm 
centrally ulcerated finely granular tan brown plaque like lesion 
. with slightly raised rolled borders. This appears to have a gritty 
gray-tan fibrotic cut surface measuring up to 0.7 cm in thickness. 
This grossly appears to focally extend through the wall focally 
shallowly into the surrounding adipose tissue adjacent to the 
ileocecal valve. In addition, this lesion focally appears to extend 
into the appendiceal orifice but does not grossly appear to obstruct 
the appendix. On sectioning, the surrounding adipose tissue shows 
several poorly defined gray tan to brown nodules up to 0.6 cm. Also 
received in the same container are three tissue cassettes each 
labeled Representative sections are submitted 
labeled as follows: A -proximal margin; B -distal margin with a 
portion of proximal margin included; C-F -representative lesion and  surrounding tissue; G -random uninvolved bowel; H -representative

Gross Description: 
Container labeled ""_""'.!II_II!II- right colon"" is a 17.5 cm 
previously opened portion of large bowel including cecum, as well as 
6.6 cm of attached unopened terminal ileum. The specimen is covered 
by a moderate amount of pericolic, epiploic and omental adipose 
tissue. An 8.6 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm vermiform appendix is identified. 
The visible serosa is shaggy and gray pink. The wall is up to 0.5 cm 
edematous and fibrotic. The lumen is lined by gray-tan mucosa with 
preservation of intestinal folds. Noted within the cecal pouch at a 
point 1.2 cm from the ileocecal valve there is a 3.5 x 3.5 cm finely 
granular centrally ulcerated plaque-like gray pink lesion with 
raised rolled borders. On sectioning, this has a gritty gray-tan 
fibrotic cut surface measuring up to 1.4 cm. This grossly appears to 
extend through the wall and into the surrounding adipose tissue 
grossly to within 0.1 cm of the nearest outer surface margin. This 
lesion grossly impinges on and markedly constricts the appendiceal 
orifice. The appendiceal orifice is markedly constricted to 0.6 cm 
in diameter as opposed to 1.6 cm in diameter in the central portion 
of the appendix. The appendix has an intact gray tan fibrotic wall 
with smooth inner lining containing transparent viscid mucus. No 
gross lesion is noted within the appendix proper. On sectioning, 
the surrounding adipose tissue reveals several poorly defined gray 
tan to yellow nodules up to 2.2 cm. On sectioning the largest 
portion appears to be a mat of nodules having focally necrotic gray 
tan cut surfaces. Several of these nodules appear to be poorly 
defined and are associated with vascular structures. Also received  _tainer are three tissue cassettes each labeled

Final Diagnosis 
Distal ileum, appendix and right colon, segment: 
Tumor characteristics: 
Histologic type: Adenocarcinoma with mucinous component (see 
comment) 
Location of tumor: 1.2 cm from the ileocecal valve 
Size: 3.5 x 3.5 x 1.4 cm in greatest dimensions 
Grade: Moderately differentiated 
Lymphovascular space invasion: Yes 
Perforation of visceral peritoneum: Yes (see comment) 
Presence of mesenteric deposits: No 
Depth of invasion: Carcinoma extends through muscularis propria 
into subserosal adipose tissue with microscopic perforation. (see 
comment) 
Surgical margin status: 
Proximal margin: No carcinoma identified 
Distal margin: No carcinoma identified 
Radial deep margin: Carcinoma extends to serosal surface with 
perforation of visceral peritoneum (see comment).

Appendix: Mucocele. PAS 3 SPC-A 
Stage: 
pT4a N2b (see comment) 
CPT: 88309 
Comments 
The carcinoma extends up to the serosal surface and in slide F is 
associated with an area of desmoplasia-granulation tissue and 
mesothelial hyperplasia associated with the carcinoma consistent 
with an area of perforation. Therefore, this is staged as a pT4a 
lesion. Multiple lymph nodes are present within the mesentery. Some 
foci consist predominantly of adenocarcinoma with only a small 
amount of residual lymphoid tissue present and these are counted as 
lymph nodes totally replaced by tumor. Seventeen of 20 lymph nodes 
are positive for metastatic carcinoma. In addition, multiple foci of 
Iymphovascular space invasion are present within the mesentery. The 
carcinoma is an adenocarcinoma with focal mucinous component. The 
mucinous component is less than 50% of the tumor and, therefore, 
this does not qualify as a mucinous/colloid adenocarcinoma. Clinical 
correlation and followup is recommended.

diagnosis.

CPT: 88309 
Stage: pT4aN2bVL (see comment) 
Comments 
Grossly in one area, the lesion umbilicated to the serosa and 
grossly appears to extend through the serosa. Microscopically, 
carcinoma is present focally extending through the visceral 
peritoneum to focally involve the serosal surface. Therefore, this 
is staged as p T 4a. Eleven of 17 lymph nodes demonstrate metastatic 
carcinoma. Some of the nodes are completely replaced by carcinoma 
with no residual nodal tissue identified. These are counted as lymph 
nodes totally replaced by tumor. Therefore, this is staged as a 
pN2b. In addition, Iymphovascular space invasion is identified and 
the additional classifications of VL are therefore used. The final 
stage should be performed in conjunction with knowledge of the 
clinical stage. 
At the request of the undersigned pathologist, these slides have  been additionally reviewed by Dr. __ who concurs with the 
diagnosis.

Diagnosis
Rectum with J-pouch, attached bladder and prostate, pelvic
exenteration:
Recurrent poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma involving rectal
mucosa, submucosa, muscularis propria, perirectal adipose tissue and
extensively infiltrating prostatic parenchyma. _
Tumor is present at the right pelvic sidewall margins
The prostatic urethral margin is positive or tumor in parenchyma and
lymphatic spaces
The rectal mucosal and deep margins are negative for tumor
Extensive lymphovascular space invasion and perineural space invasion
Microscopic Description:
Microscopic examination performed and summarized in the template below:
Histologic type: Recurrent adenocarcinoma
Histologic grade: Poorly differentiated
Primary tumor (pT): Although the tumor with somewhat difficult to
define grossly its microscopic spread was quite extensive with
prominent involvement of the rectum and J-pouch and connective tissue
between the rectum and the prostate and extensive infiltration of the
prostate and prostatic urethra and seminal vesicles. Overall the
recurrent tumor measured greater than 5 cm in greatest dimension
Proximal margin: Proximal rectal margin negative for tumor
Distal margins: Distal rectal margin negative for tumor
Circumferential (radial) margin: Right pelvic sidewall is
microscopically positive for tumor with areas of perineural space
invasion. Also tumor was present at the prostatic urethral margin
Vascular invasion: Present and prominent with both lymphatic and venous
invasion identified
Regional lymph nodes (pN): 1 residual lymph node was identified and it
is negative for metastatic tumor (0/1)
Non-lymph node pericolonic tumor: Present
Distant metastasis (pM): Not evaluated
Other findings: There is some acute colitis in the rectum that is
nonspecific. There are some nonspecific findings of chronic cystitis
in the bladder. The ureter margins were negative for tumor. However
some tumor was identified attached to the left side of the bladder in
deep nerves attached seminal vesicles.
MSI testing was not ordered as this is a recurrent tumor and not a
primary tumor.
Specimen
Bladder prostate and rectum
Clinical Information
Recurrent rectal cancer. Recurrence between J-pouch and
prostate/seminal vesicles
Gross Description
Received fresh and subsequently fixed in formalin labeled ""bladder
prostate and rectum"" is a specimen which includes a 4.3 x 3.7 white 3.7
cm prostate, an 8.5 cm portion of rectum with J-pouch, attached bladder
and prostate. The bladder is approximately 6.5 x 5.5 and is 4.0 cm
inflated. There is a catheter in the prostatic urethra and the specimen
is heavily stapled. Orientation of the specimen was reviewed by the
surgeon at time of tissue procurement. No frozen sections were
requested. Proximal end of the rectum is inked blue and the distal end of the rectum is inked black. The J-pouch of the specimen is
approximately 3 x 2.5 cm and is heavily stapled, located within 2.5 cm
of the distal margin of the rectum. The mucosa of this area is smooth
and glistening showing an average circumference of 7.5 cm in its opened
state. In the J-pouch there is a 1.2 x 0.7 cm ulcer. This comes within
2.5 cm of the distal rectal margin and 6.5 cm of the proximal rectal
margin. This comes within 1.2 cm of the anastomotic line surface of
this area shows tumor present and a scarred focus. This area of the
J-pouch is adherent to the posterior right side of the prostate. This
area is inked black. The cut surface of this area shows a white tan
scarred irregular focus which is approximately 2.5 x 2.5 x 2.5 cm. The
remainder of the cut surface of the prostate is pink-tan and diffusely
nodular. The remainder of the bladder and prostate are opened in an
anterior Y-shaped incision. Mucosa the bladder is pink-tan smooth
glistening with no other discrete gross lesions identified. The ureters
are propatent an average 4.5 x 0.3 cm. The seminal vesicles cannot be
grossly identified in a variegated and behind the rectum. Vas
deferentia cannot be grossly identified. From minimal fat is gross
identified surrounding the tissue. Possible lymph nodes may be present.
Representative sections of the specimen are submitted as follows: 1 -
representative luminal margins of the rectum, 2 - 6 - entire J-pouch
ulceration and to tumor including anastomotic line (inked blue) and
possible seminal vesicle and prostatic tissue, (from proximal to

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION 
             This tumor is a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma 
             with quite extensive invasion.  It extends through the 
  
  bowel wall and sends tongues of tumor into pericolonic fat and 
    incites a scirrhous reaction.  Because of the propensity to send 
    these narrow tongues of infiltrating tumor out into the fat, there 
    is minimal extension to the radial margin.  Also tumor nests are 
    present within soft tissue (blocks 11, 13).  Lymphatic invasion is 
    noted in the pericolonic soft tissue (block number 11).  Invasion of 
    an artery is also noted.  Please see the template below 
 
    Histologic type:  Adenocarcinoma 
    Histologic grade:  Moderately differentiated 
    Primary tumor (pT):  pT3 
    Proximal margin:  Negative for tumor 
    Distal margin:  Tumor for tumor 
    Circumferential (radial) margin:  Minimally positive 
    Distance of tumor from closest margin:  Tumor is present to within 
    1.5 cm. of the distal margin and is present at the radial margin 
    Vascular invasion:  Rare lymphatic and arterial invasion noted 
    Regional lymph nodes (pN):  52 lymph nodes present, 2 of which are 
    positive for metastatic disease, 2/52, pN1b 
    Non- lymph node pericolonic tumor: present 
    Distant metastasis (pM):  Cannot be assessed 
    Other findings:  None

smooth glistening serosa showing 3 subserosal fibroid ranging from 1.3
cm to 4.5 cm in greatest dimension. Amputation site is inked. The
specimen has attached bilateral fallopian tubes which are both
fimbriated measuring 8.0 x 0.7 cm. The ovaries are also present
averaging 3.2 x 1.7 x 1.4 cm and are pink-tan and cerebriform with a
pink-tan cystic and mottled cut surface. No papillary excrescences are
grossly identified. The specimen is opened show smooth glistening
endometrium with an average thickness of 0.2 cm. The specimen is
sectioned to show multiple intramural fibroids which range from 0.1 cm
to 5.5 cm in greatest dimension. Due to the nodular distortion of the
specimen, average thickness of the myometrium cannot be grossly
determined. Possible cystic spaces may be grossly identified subjacent
to the endometrium a 1.2 cm area. This is located within 2.8 cm of the
amputation site. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted

: IS10 5 B6 (TUMOR); IS1U : B2 (NORMAL)This panel is 
composed of the five Bethesda microsatellite markers which 
consist of two mononucleotide repeats (Le. BAT26 and BAT25) 
and three dinucleotide repeats (Le. D5S346, D2S123 and 
D17S250). This panel of markers is recommended for 
colorectal neoplasia only. The 5 MSlloci are. amplified in a 
single multiplex fluorescent PCR reaction: The PCR products 
are then analyzea on an automated DNA sequencer with 
automated allele calling and quality scoring. A tumor is 
classified as microsatellite instability high (MSI-H) if two 
or more of the five markers show instability. A tumor is 
c1assifed as microsatellite instability low (MSI-L) if only 
one of the five markers shows instability. A tumor is 
classified as microsatellite stable (MSS) if none of the 
five markers show instability. Germline mutation analysis

20.Paraffin block used: ISH'· ·AActivating PIK3CA 
mutations have been described in a number of human cancers, 
most commonly in endometrial, breast, and colorectal 
cancers. PIK3CA mutations (when present) have been reported 
to be associated with poor prognosis in each of these 
malignancies. In addition, PIK3CA mutations have been 
reported to correlate with resistance to cetuximab therapy 
in colorectal cancer patients. The regions covered in this 
analysis contain greater than 95% of the reported mutations 
of the PIK3CA gene.Total nucleic acid is elitracted and three 
PCR reactions are performed to amplify the entirety of exons 
1, 9 and 20 of PIK3CA. PCR products are then purified and 
sequenced in b6th the forward and reverse directions. For 
cases in which the tumor represents less than 10% of the 
analyzed tissue, this assay may not be able to detect 
mutations. Tumor samples submitted in a paraffin are usually 
microdissected in order to increase the sensitivity of the 
assay. This test was developed and its performance

B. The immunohistochemical study of DNA mismatch repair 
gene expression reveals the presence of normal hMLH 1, hMSH2, 
hMSH6 and hPMS2 expression in the tumor (internal controls 
stain appropriately). The findings do not exclude underlying 
Lynch Syndrome (also know as hereditary non-polyposis 
colorectal carcinoma or HNPCC), because some mutations may 
result in intact protein expression. In addition, 
alterations could exist in MSH3, which has not been tested. 
Finally, some hereditary colorectal cancers are caused by 
alterations in other unknown genes (familial colorectal 
cancer type X). 
Additional testing using a PCR based test for 
microsatellite instability (MSI) on the resected tumor will 
be performed on this specimen, and an additional addendum 
will follow.

. , "," Based on the pathology report, here is the information organized into the six categories:

Site: The site of the cancer is the rectosigmoid colon, which is the lower end of the colon.

Laterality: Not provided, as laterality refers to the side of the body where the tumor is located, and this information was not given in the report.

Histology: The histology of the cancer is adenocarcinoma, which is a type of cancer that starts in glandular cells. This is a common type of colon cancer.

Stage: The cancer is at pTNM stage pT3 N1 M1, which indicates that the tumor has grown into the outermost layers of the colon (pT3), there are cancer cells present in nearby lymph nodes (N1), and the cancer has metastasized to other parts of the body (M1).

Grade: Not provided, as the report does not mention the grade of the cancer. Grade refers to how different the cancer cells look from normal cells and can give an indication of how quickly the cancer may grow or spread.

Behavior: The behavior of this cancer is malignant, meaning it can invade nearby tissues and spread to other parts of the body. This is indicated by the fact that the cancer has metastasized (M1).

The report also mentions that a KRAS mutation analysis will be performed, which may provide additional information about the behavior and potential treatment options for this cancer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

COMMENTS: 
The vast majority of the sample submitted consists of 
invasive tumor. It is unclear what represents the exact 
margins in many of the sampled areas. However, where the 
margins can be clearly identified, tumor is seen at one . 
focus 0.1 cm from the inked radial margin and appears to be 
within 0.2 cm of both the proximal and distal mucosal 
margins. However, since the majority of the specimen does 
consist of tumor there is judged to be a significant risk 
that tumor is present at one of the resection margins. 
Clinical correlation is suggested.

Multiple enlarged lymph nodes without carcino ma were identified. These lymph nodes contained numerous follicles that appeare d 
reactive. However, due to the large size of th e lymph nodes, the number of fol licles, and the patient' s age, immunostains for BCL2, 
CD3 and CD20 were performed to exclude follicular or another low grade lymphoma. These stains reveal a be nign reactive pattern

completely obstructed, but the ascending colon lumen just distal
to the mass is patent. Gross distance of tumor from margins: The mass is 5.2 cm from
the proximal mucosal margin, 14.6 cm from the distal mucosal
margin, and 5.9 cm from the mesenteric margin. The polyp is 8.6
cm from the proximal margin, 14.9 cm from the distal mucosal
margin, and 8.1 cm from the mesenteric margin
Other remarkable findings: The appendix is intact, curved and
adherent within the mesentery. The serosa is purple/tan, smooth
and glistening. The lumen is pinpoint with a tan mucosa. The
appendix is uninvolved by mass and the mass is 1.8 cm from the
appendical orifice.

Pa111: Multiple sections of the right colon tumor mass show a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma consisting of 
well-fermed'malignant glands. In some area, the tumor cells contain abundant mucin vacuoles with a signet·ring 
appearance. However, individual infiltrating signet~ring calls are not seen. In other areas, the tumor cells form nests or 
trabeculae with irregular to angular nuclei and visible nucleolI. Although the lat1ar component taises the possibility of 
neuroendocrine difforentiation, immunostain$ for the neuroendocrine markers synaptophysin and ciiiiiiromo ranin are both 
negative. Therefore, this tumor j:;; best characterized as moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, las

Fluorescent in situ hybridization studies have been performed on the poorly differentiated colonic adenocarcinoma. The 
ratio of HER·21neu to the centromere of chromosome 17 is 1.70, indicating low level HER·21neu amplification in the

COMMEN : 
Much of this tumor is a well differentiated adenocarcinoma, and the perieolonie lymph node metastasis from part 4 is of 
this pattern. However, some of the deeply invasive tumor is mucinous, and this pattern is present in the liver biopsy. 
Trichrome and PAS stains were performed on the liver biopsy ( part 1). The trichrome stain highlights desmoplastic 
fibrosis within the metastatic carcinoma. The PAS stain highlights Intracellular and extracellular mucin within the 
metastatic carcinoma.

Block 20: 
A. KRAS codon 12113 mutation IDENTIFIED (Oly12Val). 
Noto: 
The quantity and quality of isolated DNA was acceptable for testing. 
The predictive value of KRAS mutation In colorectal cancer patients treated with cetuximab (anti.EGFR monoclonal 
antibody) chemotherapy has recently been reported 1. Mutations in the KRAS codon 12/13 gone were found to be 
associated with resistance to cetuximab therapy, worse prognosis and poor survival in patients with metastatic colorec:tal 
cancer. 1-4 However, not all tumors reveal such a correlation, therefore the presence of KRAS mutations should be 
interpreted in the context of the cytolooic and histoloQiC filidinj:iS and the patient's clinical history.

High-level MSI may have prognostic implications, and patiti'nts with these tumors may be at risk for Hereditary Non­

associated with that syndrome is indicated In patients with hlgh~level MSI, after appropriate ,lnformOd consent a~d genet1c

The carcinoma extensively involves the colonic wall, from the mucosa to the pericolic adipose tissue, but no definite 
precursor lesion is Seen in the colonic mucosa. There is extensive, plaque·li~e extramural/subserosa I involvement as 
well, with areas of serosal penetration and at least one focus where cauterized carcinoma is present at what appears to 
be the radial andlor mesocolic specimen edge. This corresponds to the operative report describing dense tumor 
infiltrating the pelvic sidewall over the iliac vess!,ls, through whiCh the surgeon cut. In addition, immunohistochemical 
stains reveal the carcinoma to be strongly positive for cytokeratin 7 with only focal positivity for cytokeratin 20. CDX·2 is 
completely negative. as are TTF·1 and PSA. CEA and cytokeratin 19 are positive. Positive immunostains for the DNA 
mismatch repair proteins MLH-l, PMS-2, MSH·2 and MSH·6 reveal preserved nuclear expression. In summary, the overall 
morphological findings and immunohistochemical profile are not typical of a primary colorectal adenocarcinoma. A 
possible primary site compatible with the immunomorphologlcal findings is the pancreaticobiliary system. Alternatively, 
if another potential primary site cannot be found clinically, this could be a primary peritoneal adenocarcinoma with 
extension into the colonic wall. Finally, the lymph node total includes one lymph node confirmed to be negative for 
carcinoma by a negative cytokeratin AE1/AE3 immunos!ain. "," 1. ""Site"": Sigmoid colon, as it's the location where the resection was performed and the cancer was found.

Light microscopic examination is performed by Sections of the colo -rectum s how a moderately -differentiated adenocarcinoma 
widely invading muscularis propria with a pushing borde r, and with focal invasion into perirectal soft tissue (A29). Lymphovascular, 
venous, or perineural invasion is not identified. Tumor approaches multiple pe rirectal soft tissue margins as demonstrated in 
perpendicular margi n sections taken at the time of intraoperative evaluation.  
 
Signature  
Resident Physician:  
Attending Pathologist: I have personally conducted the evaluation of the above specimens and hav e rendered the above 
diagnosis(es).  
"," Site: The specimens are from the colon, small bowel, and rectum. This is based on the container labels and the description of the specimens.

Laterality: Not provided, as there is no information indicating the location of the specimens in relation to right or left sides of the body.

Histology: The specimens show a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, invasive muscularis propria with focal invasion into perirectal soft tissue. This is based on the light microscopic examination report.

Stage: Not provided, as there is not enough information to determine the stage of the cancer. Stage would typically depend on tumor size, lymph node involvement, and metastasis, which are not fully described in this case.

Grade: The tumor is moderately differentiated, indicating a grade of 2 or 3 (depending on the specific grading system used).

Behavior: The behavior of the tumor is malignant, as it is an invasive adenocarcinoma.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nueiear Grade "," Based on the given microscopic description, here is the information categorized under Site, Laterality, Histology, Stage, Grade, and Behavior:

1. Site: The site is not explicitly mentioned in the description, but based on the mention of alveolar formation, it could be a lung or breast tissue. However, without more context, this cannot be confirmed.
2. Laterality: The laterality of the tumor is also not provided in the description.
3. Histology: The tumor shows features of sarcomatous differentiation, with round and spindle cells present. There is also mention of keratin secretion, suggesting squamous differentiation. Therefore, the histological type could be a carcinosarcoma or a mixed malignant tumor with both epithelial and mesenchymal components.
4. Stage: The stage of the tumor is not explicitly mentioned in the description, but based on the presence of necrosis, lymphocytic infiltration, vascular invasion, and fibrosis, it is likely to be an advanced-stage tumor.
5. Grade: Based on the mention of nuclear atypia, hyperchromatism, and mitotic activity, the tumor appears to be high grade (III).
6. Behavior: The behavior of the tumor is malignant, as indicated by its invasive features and high-grade morphology.

In summary, based on the microscopic description provided, the tumor is likely to be a high-grade carcinosarcoma or mixed malignant tumor located in the lung or breast, with advanced stage and malignant behavior. However, without more context and clinical information, this interpretation should be considered preliminary.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

STAFF FOR RESEARCH USE ONLY). "," Based on the given pathology report, the relevant categories with available information are:

Site: The tissue sample is from a distant metastasis; however, the primary site or organ is not specified in the report.

Laterality: The report does not mention whether the metastasis is on the left or right side of the body.

Histology: The histological diagnosis is not explicitly stated in the report, but there are descriptions of various cell types and structures, such as squamous cells, glandular cells, spindle cells, and mosaic pattern, among others.

Stage: The pathological staging is provided as pT y N0 M0, which indicates that the tumor (T) is limited to its original location without invasion into nearby structures (pT y), there are no cancer cells in nearby lymph nodes (N0), and there are no distant metastases (M0).

Grade: The report does not provide a clear nuclear grade or differentiation grade for the tumor. However, it mentions some features suggestive of higher-grade malignancy, such as aniso nucleosis, hyperchromatism, and mitotic activity.

Behavior: Based on the available information, the behavior of this tumor is likely to be malignant, given its metastatic nature and some high-grade features. However, a definitive assessment cannot be made without more complete information.

In summary, the report provides limited information for categorizing the tumor's site, laterality, histology, stage, grade, and behavior. Further investigation and testing are required to make a comprehensive diagnosis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

III "," Based on the pathology report fragment provided, the six categories with available or inferred information are:

1. Site: Not explicitly mentioned but can be inferred as a primary tumor in an organ (based on the 'Primary Tumor' section).
2. Laterality: Also not provided in the fragment.
3. Histology: Diffuse cell distribution with mosaic, storiform, and clusterized patterns; squamous, glandular, round, lymphomatous, spindle cells; keratin secretion; and other features can be found (based on the 'Primary Tumor' section).
4. Stage: Pathological staging is given as pT3 N0 M0, which corresponds to a primary tumor invading beyond the subserosa or into nearby organs/structures without regional lymph node metastasis and no distant metastasis.
5. Grade: Not explicitly mentioned in the fragment; however, nuclear atypia is described as ""Nuclear Atypia: 0 I II III"" which could be used to infer a grade if more information was provided.
6. Behavior: The behavior of this tumor cannot be definitively classified based on the given fragment.

Justification: The interpretation is based on extracting relevant details from various sections of the pathology report, including 'Primary Tumor', 'Pathological Staging', and 'Microscopic Description'. However, many crucial pieces of information are missing or incomplete, making it challenging to provide a comprehensive assessment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"," 1. ""Site"": Cecum. Justification: The report specifically mentioned the tumor to be located in the cecum.
2. ""Laterality"": Not provided. Justification: The report does not mention laterality as the surgery was a right hemicolectomy, which implies the cancer was on the right side of the colon but doesn't specify if it's left or right of the midline in the body.
3. ""Histology"": Mucinous Adenocarcinoma, low grade, moderately differentiated. Justification: The report clearly states this as the diagnosis for the specimen from the right hemicolectomy.
4. ""Stage"": T3 N1 MX. Justification: The report provides the AJCC Classification (8th edition) as T3 N1 M0, indicating the tumor has invaded through the muscularis propria but hasn't reached the serosa (T3), there are positive lymph nodes (N1), and no distant metastasis has been identified (MX).

Addendum: 
Upon re-review of this case, there is a focus of possible invasion into a 
venule outside of muscularis propria. In that focus, a tumor cell nest is 
surrounded by discontinuous smooth muscle cells, which probably represent 
residual venular wall.

PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS: Report Status: Final 
A. SPECIMEN DESIGNATED ""RIGHT HEMICOLECTOMY"" (29 cm): 
ADENOCARCINOMA, high grade, moderately differentiated {15 cm in 
greatest dimension} . 
Tumor is located in right colon (cecum), is ulcerative, and has a 
pushing border. 
Tumor invades through muscularis propria into serosal surface. 
Proximal, distal, and radial resection margins are negative for tumor. 
Invasive tumor is 7.5 cm from proximal resection margin, 10 ern from 
distal resection margin, and 2 cm from radial resection margin. 
Lymphovascular invasion is not identified. 
Extramural venous invasion is not identified. 
Perineural invasion is identified. 
Peritumoral lymphoid response (including Crohn1s-like infiltrate) is 
mild. 
NOTE: Residual adenoma is absent. 
Immunohistochemistry performed at. demonstrates the following 
staining profile in lesional cells: 
Positive -CK20 (rare) 
Negative -CK7, CDX2, synaptophysin, chromogranin 
Regional lymph nodes (positive: total) : 0:35. 
AJCC Classification (6th edition): T4b NO MX. 
Irnrnunostains for MLH1 and PMS2 reveal absence of nuclear staining in tumor 
cells (and intact nuclear staining in non~rteoplastic cells). Immunostains for 
MSH2 and MSH6 reveal intact nuclear staining in tumor cells. 
In most tumors with loss of MLH1 and PMS2 staining, the defect is caused by 
sporadic methylation silencing, and is not associated with a germline mutation. 
Less commonly, MLHl and PMS2 loss is caused by a germline mutation in the MLHl 
gene (or rarely in the PMS2 gene)"" usually in the setting of a family history 
of colorectal, endometrial, gastric, or other cancers (HNPCC). Colorectal 
cancers with mismatch repair deficiency are associated with improved overall

GROSS DESCRIPTION: 
The specimen is received fresh, in two parts, each labeled with the patient's 
name, unit number. 
Part A, labeled ""#1. Right hemicolectomy"", consists of a right hemicolectomy, 
including a portion of terminal ileum (7.0 em in length), a segment of right 
colon and cecum (22.0 em in length), and an appendix (6.0 em in length, 0.4 em 
in diameter), and attached pericolic adipose tissue (including a portion of 
adipose tissue consistent with omentum, measuring 30.0 x 16.0 x 1.2 em). The 
proximal stapled resection margin measures 3.0 em and is inked blue, and the 
distal stapled resection margin measures 4.0 em and is inked black. The serosa 
is pink and focally firm at the cecum and proximal portion of right colon (11.0 
x 9.0 em), 7.0 ern from the proximal stapled resection margin and 10.0 em from 
the distal stapled resection margin. The specimen is opened to reveal an 
exophytic focally ulcerating irregular tan-yellow to pink mass (15.0 x 10.0 x 
4.0 cm). The mass involves the adjacent ileocecal valve, and comes to 7.5 em 
from the proximal stapled resection margin, and 10.0 em from the distal stapled 
resection margin. Per the surgeon, there is an ""adhesed peritoneal folding 
area (8.0 x 8.0 cm}II, within the previously described firm serosal area, 
designated as ""true resection margin II (inked black). On cut section, the mass 
extends into the underlying colonic wall, and into the surrounding pericolic 
adipose tissue, coming to less than 0.1 em from the black ink peritonealized 
margin, as designated per the surgeon, and is 2.0 em from the closest radial 
mesenteric margin. Representative sections of the mass are submitted to the GI 
stern cell lab for special studies, and additional representative sections of 
the mass and uninvolved colonic mucosa are submitted to tissue bank for special 
studies. The remaining mucosa is tan with normal folds, with no additional 
discrete masses or lesions identified. Multiple tan-pink rubbery lymph nodes 
are identified within the surrounding pericolonic adipose tissue, ranging from 
0.2 ern to 1.6 crn in greatest dimension. Gross photos are taken.

1). The specimen is received fresh, labeled ""total colectomy"""" and consists 
of a segment of terminal ileum, cecum with attached appendix, ascending, 
transverse, descending and sigmoid colon. The terminal ileum measures 12 cm 
in length and 3.5 cm in circumference at the proximal resected margin. The 
remaining colon measures 95.5 in length with a circumference of nine cm at 
the distal resected margin. The attached appendix measures 8 cm in length 
and averages 0.5 cm in diameter. The appendiceal and intestinal serosa is 
pink tan and smooth. Focally hemorrhagic lobulated yellow tan adipose 
tissue spans the length of the specimen measuring up to 2.5 cm in thickness. 
The specimen is opened to reveal a mass lesion measuring 3 em in length and 
4 cm in width. The mass is located in the sigmoid colon, 85 em from the 
proximal margin and 7 cm from the distal margin. Sectioning shows that the 
tumor invades the muscularis propria and possibly the serosa. The depth of 
invasion is 0.3 cm grossly. The remaining mucosa shows two sessile polyp, 
measuring 0.5 x 0.5 x 0 .3 and 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm. The attached adipose 
tissue is submitted for lymph node dissection and all identified lymph nodes 
are submitted. The colon is extensively sampled with representative sections

The patient is a 64-year-old woman with a history of left breast mass. The mass was excised and measured 2.8 cm in greatest dimension. Histologically, the tumor is moderately differentiated invasive ductal carcinoma (Nottingham combined score 7/9). No lymphovascular invasion or skin or nipple involvement was identified. All surgical margins were negative. The 12 sentinel lymph nodes examined were negative for metastatic carcinoma. The tumor is estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor positive, HER2/neu negative by immunohistochemistry. The staging follows the TNM system: pT2pN0Mx.

1. Site: left breast. Justification: The report mentions a ""left breast mass"" that was excised.

1). The specimen is received fresh, labeled ""Right colon"" and consists of a 
segment of terminal ileum, cecum, and ascending colon. The appendix is not 
grossly identified. The terminal ileum measures 12 cm in length and 4 cm in 
circumference at the proximal resected margin. The remaining colon measures 
23 in length with a circumference of 7.2 cm at the distal resected margin. 
The intestinal serosa is pink tan and smooth. Focally hemorrhagic lobulated 
yellow tan adipose tissue spans the length of the specimen measuring up to 
5.5 cm in thickness. The specimen is opened to reveal a friable, polypoid 
mass lesion measuring 5.0 cm in length and B.O cm in width. The mass is 
located in-the large intestine, 14 cm from the proximal margin and 20 cm 
from the distal margin. Sectioning shows that the tumor grossly invades 
through the muscularis and involves the underlying adipose tisaue, and 1.5 
cm from the ileocecal valve. The depth of invasion is 0.4 em grossly. The 
ileocecal valve is granular and markedly edematous. The remaining mucosa is 
tan-brown with the normal fords. The attached adipose tissue is submitted 
for lymph node dissection. Representative sections of the specimen are

Justification: The specimen is labeled as a right colectomy and the tumor is described as located 6.3 cm from the ileocecal valve.

Laterality: Not provided
Justification: The laterality (left or right) of the colon is not explicitly mentioned in the description, but the specimen is referred to as a ""right colectomy,"" which implies removal of the right colon.

Histology: Adenocarcinoma
Justification: The report mentions the presence of a ""tumor"" and describes it as having various features consistent with adenocarcinoma, such as gland formation and desmoplastic reaction.

Stage: Not provided
Justification: The report does not include information about the tumor stage, such as the extent of spread to lymph nodes or distant organs.

Grade: Moderately differentiated
Justification: The report describes the tumor as having ""moderate"" differentiation, which is a common way of referring to moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.

       an undesignated sigmoid colon (19.5 cm in length and ranges in circumference       from 6.2 to 8.0 cm) with attached pericolonic fat (17.3 x 8.5 x 2.5 cm).

       serosal surface is pink, glistening and intact. The presumed distal         
       resection margin is inked black and presumed proximal resection margin is   
       inked red. The specimen is opened to reveal an exophytic, bosselated, tumor 
       ( 6.5 cm in length and 4.5 cm in width) that is located 10.0 cm from the           proximal margin and 4.5 cm from the distal margin. Serial sectioning reveals
       the tumor has a depth of 2.5 cm. Thorough sectioning show that the tumor    
       appears to be limited to the muscularis propria without invasion beyond the 
       muscle. There is 2nd tan polypoid mass , located 1.5 cm from the tumor which
       is sampled. The remaining mucosa is grossly unremarkable.  Pericolic and           perirectal adipose tissue is thoroughly examined for lymph nodes, and all   
       possible nodes are submitted. Representative sections are submitted. The    
       tumor area is extensively sampled. TPS is submitted.

       2. The specimen is received in formalin, labeled ""Proximal ring"" and        
       consists of a silver metal anastomotic pin measuring 7.5 x 2.8 x 1.5 cm. At 
       the center of the pin, a blue plastic piece is noted.  A ring of pink tan   
       soft tissue is attached measuring 2.3 x 2.2 x 1.1 cm.  The mucosal surface         is pink tan and focally hemorrhagic and the serosal surface is pink tan and 
       smooth. Several sutures and staples are noted.  The sutures and staples are 
       removed and the soft tissue is entirely submitted.

        Gross Description:                                                          
                                                                                   
                                                                 
                                                                                          1. The specimen is received fresh, labeled ""total abdominal colectomy"" and         consists of a segment of terminal ileum, cecum with attached appendix and   
       colon.  The terminal ileum measures 11.0 cm in length and 4.2 cm in         
       circumference at the proximal resected margin.  The remaining colon measures
       96.0 cm in length with a circumference of 6.0 cm at the distal resected     
       margin.  The attached appendix measures 8.0 cm in length and averages 0.7 cm       in diameter.  The appendiceal and intestinal serosa is pink tan and smooth. 
       Focally hemorrhagic lobulated yellow tan adipose tissue spans the length of 
       the specimen measuring up to 1.3 cm in thickness.  The specimen is opened to
       reveal a mass lesion measuring 3.0 cm in length and 2.6 cm in width. The    
       mass is located in the ascending colon, 16.1 cm from the proximal margin and        89.0 cm from the distal margin. Sectioning shows that the tumor invades    
       into the muscularis propria. The depth of invasion is 0.9 cm grossly.  The  
       are two polyps measuring  0.2 and 0.7 cm in the transverse colon.           
       Diverticula and muscle wall thickening are present in the distal 14.0 cm of 
       the colon.  The remaining mucosa is grossly unremarkable. The attached             adipose tissue is thoroughly examined and all identified lymph nodes are    
       submitted. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted for        
       permanent sections and for TPS.

"," Based on the addendum diagnosis report, the following categories can be determined:

1. Site: Colon or rectal carcinoma, not specified in the report.
2. Laterality: Not provided, as the report does not mention whether the tumor is right-sided or left-sided.
3. Histology: Adenocarcinoma, based on the immunohistochemical staining for DNA mismatch repair proteins.
4. Stage: Not provided, as the report does not include information about the stage of the tumor.
5. Grade: Also not provided, as there is no information about the differentiation or growth rate of the tumor.
6. Behavior: Malignant, based on the fact that it is a carcinoma and has abnormal MSH2 and MSH6 protein expression.

Justification: The report mentions immunohistochemical staining for DNA mismatch repair proteins, which is typically performed for colorectal cancers, and identifies the tumor as an adenocarcinoma. Additionally, the abnormal protein expression suggests a malignant behavior. However, the specific site, laterality, stage, and grade are not provided in the report.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

       consists of a 18.2 cm in length and a 5.5 cm in circumference of                   rectosigmoid colon. The serosa is glistening, smooth, tan-pink. The serosal 
       surface is inked black and the specimen is opened to reveal a 5.3 (l) x 5.5 
       (w) cm, well-circumscribed, centrally cavitated and necrotic, serpiginous   
       bordered, sessile mass,  located 9.5 cm from the (probable) distal margin,  
       occupying the full circumference of the lumen (designated Mass #1).  Serial        sectioning reveals Mass #1 to invade through the muscularis into the        
       pericolonic fat, to a depth of  1.1 cm, which is 2.8 cm from the closest    
       radial margin. In addition, 1.1 cm distal to Mass #1, is a 0.4 (l) x 0.4    
       (w), well-circumscribed, smooth, homogenous tan nodule, located 3.9 cm away 
       from the distal margin (designated Nodule #1).  Sectioning reveals Nodule #1       to remain confined to the mucosa. The remaining mucosa is unremarkable. The 
       specimen is submitted for lymph node dissection. Pericolic and peri-rectal  
       adipose tissue is thoroughly examined for lymph nodes, and all possible     
       nodes are submitted. Representative sections are submitted. TPS is submitted
       for Mass #1.

       Some of the immunohistochemistry and ISH tests were developed and their     
       performance characteristics were determined by the Department of Pathology.        They have not been cleared or approved by the US Food and Drug              
       Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is   
       not necessary. These tests are used for clinical purposes. They should not  
       be regarded as investigational or for research. This laboratory is certified

       1).  The specimen is received fresh, labeled ""Right colon"" and consists of a
       segment of terminal ileum, cecum with attached appendix and ascending colon.
        The terminal ileum measures 6 cm in length and 3.5 cm in circumference at         the proximal resected margin.  The remaining colon measures 33 cm in length 
       with a circumference of 7 cm at the distal resected margin.  The attached   
       appendix measures 7 cm in length and averages 0.4 cm in diameter.  The      
       appendiceal and intestinal serosa is pink tan and smooth.  Focally          
       hemorrhagic lobulated yellow tan adipose tissue spans the length of the            specimen measuring up to 3 cm in thickness.  Attached unremarkable omental  
       fat measures 18 x 6 x 1.3 cm.  The specimen is opened to reveal a mass      
       lesion measuring 5.2 cm in length and 4.1 cm in width. Sectioning show that 
       the tumor invades into the muscularis. The depth of invasion is 0.3 cm      
       grossly.  The remaining mucosa is grossly unremarkable. Multiple lymph nodes       are identified in the attached adipose tissue and are submitted.            
       Representative sections of the specimen are submitted for permanent sections
       and for TPS.

       Some of the immunohistochemistry and ISH tests were developed and their     
       performance characteristics were determined by the department of pathology. 
       They have not been cleared or approved by the US food and drug                     administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is   
       not necessary. These tests are used for clinical purposes. They should not

       hemorrhagic lobulated yellow tan adipose tissue spans the length of the     
       specimen measuring up to 2.0 cm in thickness.  The specimen is opened to    
       reveal a partially fungating and partially infiltrating lesion measuring 8.5
       cm in length and 7 cm in width. The mass is located in the cecum, 11.5 cm          from the proximal margin and 39 cm from the distal margin. Sectioning shows 
       that the tumor invades possibly subserosal fibroadipose tissue. The depth of
       invasion is 1.1 cm grossly.  The remaining mucosa shows 3 polyps measuring  
       0.2 to 2.5 cm in greatest dimension. The attached adipose tissue is         
       thoroughly examined and all identified lymph nodes are submitted.                  Representative sections of the specimen are submitted for permanent sections
       and for TPS.

       I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF  
       THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL), AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED   
       THIS REPORT.

       segment of terminal ileum, cecum with attached appendix and ascending colon.
        The terminal ileum measures 12.0 cm in length and 3.6 cm in circumference         at the proximal resected margin.  The remaining colon measures 14.0 in      
       length with a circumference of 5.4 cm at the distal resected margin.  The   
       attached appendix measures 5.8 cm in length and averages 0.7 cm in diameter.
        The appendiceal and intestinal serosa is pink tan and smooth.  Focally     
       hemorrhagic lobulated yellow tan adipose tissue spans the length of the            specimen measuring up to the 3.8 cm in thickness.  The specimen is opened to
       reveal a mass lesion measuring 2.1 cm in length and 2.8 cm in width. The    
       mass is located in the right colon,  3.8 cm distal to the ileocecal valve,  
       17.0 cm from the proximal margin and 6.5 cm from the distal margin.         
       Sectioning shows that the tumor invades the underlying muscularis. The depth       of invasion is 0.5 cm grossly.  The remaining mucosa is remarkable for a 0.7
       x 0.1 to 0.4 cm sessile polyp 1.0 cm distal to the tumor.  The attached     
       adipose tissue is thoroughly examined and all identified lymph nodes are    
       submitted. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted for        
       permanent sections and for TPS.

        The terminal ileum measures 8.5 cm in length and 4.5 cm in circumference at
       the proximal resected margin.  The remaining colon measures 29.0 in length  
       with a circumference of 7.0 cm at the distal resected margin.  The attached 
       appendix measures 4.0 cm in length and averages 0.5 cm in diameter.  The           appendiceal and intestinal serosa is pink tan and smooth.  Focally          
       hemorrhagic lobulated yellow tan adipose tissue spans the length of the     
       specimen measuring up to 4.5 cm in thickness.  The specimen is opened to    
       reveal a mass lesion measuring 3.7 cm in length and 4.0 cm in width. The    
       mass is located in the large bowel 0.3 cm from the ileocecal valve, 11.0 cm        from the proximal margin and 24 cm from the distal margin. Sectioning shows 
       that the tumor grossly invades through the muscularis and serosa. The depth 
       of invasion is 0.3 cm grossly.  The remaining mucosa is tan-brown with the  
       normal folds. There are multiple minute polypoid lesions on the terminal    
       ileum mucosa. The attached adipose tissue is thoroughly examined and all           identified lymph nodes are submitted. Representative sections of the        
       specimen are submitted for permanent sections and for TPS.

       left stitch marks proximal "" and consists of a segment of colon measuring 49       cm in length with a circumference of 4.5 cm at the distal resected margin.  
       Focally hemorrhagic lobulated yellow tan adipose tissue spans the length of 
       the specimen measuring up to 4 cm in thickness.  The specimen is opened to  
       reveal a mass lesion measuring 3.5 cm in length and 2.2 cm in width. The    
       mass is located 36 cm from the proximal margin and 4.3 cm from the distal          margin. Sectioning shows that the tumor invades the muscularis propria. The 
       depth of invasion is 0.5 cm grossly.  The remaining mucosa shows two small  
       polyps measuring 0.3 cm in greatest dimensions located 17 cm proximal to the
       tumor. The attached adipose tissue is thoroughly examined and all identified
       lymph nodes are submitted. Representative sections of the specimen are             submitted for permanent sections and for TPS.

Justification: The specimen is labeled as left hemicolectomy and the gross description mentions the location of the mass lesion in the left colon.

Laterality: Not provided
Justification: The report does not mention the laterality, it could be assumed that it is left-sided based on the procedure, but it's not explicitly stated.

Histology: Adenocarcinoma
Justification: The use of terms such as ""tumor"" and ""mass lesion"" in the gross description, along with the mention of ""polyps"" suggests a malignant neoplasm, most likely adenocarcinoma.

       segment of terminal ileum and colon with attached omentum.  The terminal    
       ileum measures 14.5 cm in length and 3.0 cm in circumference at the proximal
       resection margin, which is inked violet.  The remaining colon measures 26.3 
       in length with a circumference of 6.6 cm at the distal resection margin,           which is inked orange.  The attached appendix measures 6.1 cm in length and 
       averages 0.4 cm in diameter.  The appendiceal and intestinal serosa is pink 
       and smooth.  Lobulated fatty tissue spans the length of the specimen        
       measuring up to 5.2 cm in thickness.  The attached omentum measures 7 x 6 x 
       1.3 centimeters.  The specimen is opened to reveal a pink-tan fungating mass       measuring 3.5 cm in length and 3.1 cm in width. The mass is located in the  
       ascending colon, 4.5 cm from the ileocecal valve, 17.8 cm from the proximal 
       margin and 16.1 cm from the distal margin. Sectioning shows a depth of      
       invasion of 0.2 cm grossly.  A tatoo is identified adjacent to the tumor.   
       Multiple diverticula are present. The remaining mucosa is unremarkable. The        attached adipose tissue is submitted for lymph node dissection, and all     
       identified lymph nodes are submitted. Representative sections of the        
       specimen are submitted for permanent sections and for TPS.

"," Site: Right colon
Justification: Specimen is labeled ""Right colon"" in the gross description.

Laterality: Not provided
Justification: The laterality is not explicitly mentioned in the report.

Histology: Adenocarcinoma
Justification: The diagnosis section mentions a ""pericolorectal soft tissue tumor,"" and the gross description states there is a ""fungating mass"" in the ascending colon, which suggests adenocarcinoma.

Stage: pT2 N0
Justification: The report provides the AJCC 7th Edition staging for the primary tumor (pT2) and regional lymph nodes (N0).

Grade: Not provided
Justification: The grade of the tumor is not mentioned in the report.

Behavior: Malignant
Justification: The diagnosis section mentions a ""tumor"" without specifying whether it is benign or malignant, but the use of AJCC staging and the description of the mass in the gross description suggest that it is malignant.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

       length and 5 cm in diameter. The serosal surface is pink and glistening. The
       radial resection margin is inked black and the specimen is opened to reveal 
       a tumor that is located 12 cm from the proximal margin and 5.5 cm from the  
       distal margin. The tumor measures 2 cm in length and 1.5 cm in width. Serial       sectioning reveals tumor invasion to a depth of 0.6 cm, which is 2.5 cm from
       the closest radial margin. The remaining mucosa is grossly unremarkable.    
       Pericolic and peri-rectal adipose tissue is thoroughly examined for lymph   
       nodes, and all possible nodes are submitted. Representative sections are    
       submitted. TPS is submitted. The specimen is submitted for lymph node              dissection.

       at the proximal resected margin.  The remaining colon measures 70 cm in     
       length with a circumference of 3.5 cm at the distal resected margin.  The   
       attached appendix measures 5 cm in length and averages 0.5 cm in diameter.  
       The appendiceal and intestinal serosa is pink tan and smooth.  Focally             hemorrhagic lobulated yellow tan adipose tissue spans the length of the     
       specimen measuring up to 3 cm in thickness.  The specimen is opened to      
       reveal a mass lesion measuring 4 cm in length and 5.5 cm in width. The mass 
       is located in the ascending colon,  18 cm from the proximal margin and 50 cm
       from the distal margin. Sectioning shows that the tumor invades the                muscularis. The depth of invasion is 0.4 cm grossly.  The remaining mucosa  
       shows numerous diverticula.  NO gross lesion is identified in the sigmoid   
       colon.  Two possible tattoo sites are present.  One is 26 cm from the       
       proximal margin and the other is 30 cm from the distal margin.  The attached
       adipose tissue is thoroughly examined and all identified lymph nodes are           submitted. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted.

       Immunohistochemical stains for mismatch repair proteins demonstrate loss of 
       expression on MLH1 and PMS2.  MSH2 and MSH6 expression are preserved.  These       results imply an underlying deficiency in DNA mismatch repair function.

       not necessary. These tests are used for clinical purposes. They should not  
       be regarded as investigational or for research. This laboratory is certified       under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of  (CLIA '  as 
       qualified to perform high complexity clinical laboratory testing.

       3). The specimen is received fresh, labeled ""Right hemi-colectomy"" and      
       consists of a segment of terminal ileum, cecum and ascending colon.  The    
       terminal ileum measures 14 cm in length and 3 cm in circumference at the    
       proximal resected margin.  The remaining colon measures 40 in length with a        circumference of 6 cm at the distal resected margin.  The appendix is not   
       present.  The intestinal serosa is pink tan and smooth.  Focally hemorrhagic
       lobulated yellow tan adipose tissue spans the length of the specimen        
       measuring up to 5 cm in thickness.  The specimen is opened to reveal a      
       circumferential mass lesion measuring 6 cm in length and 8 cm in width. The        mass is located in the cecum, 23 cm from the proximal margin and 15 cm from 
       the distal margin. Sectioning shows that the tumor invades the fat. The     
       depth of invasion is 1.8 cm grossly. Right underneath the mass is a 4 x 2.5 
       x 2 cm conglomerate of five nodules with yellow/white cut surface (distance 
       from tumor surface to the deepest portion of the conglomerate is 4.8 cm).          The remaining mucosa is unremarkable. The specimen is submitted for lymph   
       node dissection.  The attached adipose tissue is thoroughly examined and all
       identified lymph nodes are submitted. Representative sections of the        
       specimen are submitted for permanent sections and for TPS.

       consists of an unoriented segment of sigmoid colon that measures 26 x 6 cm. 
       The serosal surface is unremarkable. The radial resection margin is inked   
       black and the specimen is opened to reveal a polypoid tumor that is located 
       2.4 cm from one margin and 21 cm from the opposite margin. The tumor               measures 2.5 cm in length and 2 cm in width. Serial sectioning reveals that 
       the tumor maximum thickness is 1.5 cm. The remaining mucosa is unremarkable.
        Pericolic adipose tissue spans the entire length of the specimen with a    
       maximum thickness of 12 cm. It is submitted for lymph node dissection and

                                                                                          1. The specimen is received fresh, labeled ""Right colon"" and consists of a         segment of terminal ileum, cecum with attached appendix and ascending colon.
        The terminal ileum measures 15.2 cm in length and 4.1 cm in circumference  
       at the proximal resected margin.  The remaining colon measures 41.6 in      
       length with a circumference of 8.2 cm at the distal resected margin.  The   
       attached appendix measures 9 cm in length and averages 0.8 cm in diameter.         The appendiceal and intestinal serosa are pink tan and smooth. The colonic  
       serosa has a focus of retraction and is inked black.  Focally hemorrhagic   
       lobulated yellow tan adipose tissue spans the length of the specimen        
       measuring up to 6 cm in thickness. There is also omentum (17.2 to 15 x 1 cm)
       which is serially sectioned revealing unremarkable adipose tissue. The             specimen is opened to reveal a circumferential tan-pink mass measuring 3.5  
       cm in length and 8 cm in width. The mass is located in the transverse colon,
       immediately adjacent to a tattoo site, 32.2 cm from the proximal margin,    
       10.3 cm from the distal margin, and 16.5 cm from the ileocecal valve.       
       Sectioning shows that the tumor invades the muscularis. The depth of               invasion is 0.3 cm grossly; the tumor has a thickness of 0.6 centimeters.   
       There are two tan-pink polypoidal masses (1.1 cm and 0.4 cm in greatest     
       dimension) located 3.0 cm and 4.5 cm from ileocecal valve, respectively. The
       remaining mucosa is unremarkable. The attached adipose tissue is thoroughly 
       examined and all identified lymph nodes are submitted. Representative              sections of the specimen are submitted for permanent sections and for

       five CM in diameter. The serosal surface is focally puckered and wrapped by 
       fat towards the distal aspect of the specimen. The radial serosal surface is
       inked black and the specimen is opened to reveal an ulcerated tumor         
       measuring 5x2x0.4 cm causing slight constriction near the proximal end.            Tumor is located 13 cm from the distal margin and 6 cm from the proximal    
       margin. Serial sectioning reveals tumor invasion to a depth of 0.4 cm       
       penetrating through the muscularis propria.. The remaining mucosa appears   
       grossly unremarkable.  Pericolic and peri-rectal adipose tissue is          
       thoroughly examined for lymph nodes, and all possible nodes are submitted.         Representative sections are submitted. TPS is submitted.

       consists of a portion of sigmoid colon that measures 18.5cm in length x 10.0       cm in open circumference at the distal margin. The serosal surface is pink  
       tan and unremarkable. The radial resection margin is inked black and the    
       specimen is opened to reveal a tumor that is located 9.0 cm from the        
       proximal margin and 6.0 cm from the distal margin. The tumor measures 2.8 cm
       in length and 6.5 cm in width. Serial sectioning reveals tumor extending  to       a depth of 0.7 cm,  through the muscularis and grossly approaching into the 
       underlying pericolic fat.  The tumor is 4.0 cm from the closest radial      
       margin. The remaining mucosa shows tan-yellow grossly unremarkable mucosal  
       folds.  Pericolic and peri-rectal adipose tissue is thoroughly examined for 
       lymph nodes, and all possible nodes are submitted. Representative sections         are submitted. TPS is submitted.

Justification: According to the TNM staging system, Stage II indicates that the tumor has grown into the outermost layers of the colon or rectum and may have invaded nearby tissue but has not gone through the visceral peritoneum.

Grade: Not provided
Justification: The report does not include information about the grade of the tumor.

Behavior: Malignant
Justification: As this is a pathology report for a cancer case, it is assumed that the behavior of the tumor is malignant.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

       consists of a segment of terminal ileum, cecum with attached appendix and          ascending colon.  The terminal ileum measures 11.5 cm in length and 3.0 cm  
       in circumference at the proximal resected margin.  The remaining colon      
       measures 20.0 cm in length with a circumference of 7.0 cm at the distal     
       resected margin.  There is no attached appendix, and serosa displays a 0.7 x
       0.5cm white ill-defined fibrotic focus of a possible previous appendectomy         site which is submitted.  The intestinal serosa is pink tan and smooth.     
       Focally hemorrhagic lobulated yellow tan adipose tissue spans the length of 
       the specimen measuring up to 4.5 cm in thickness.  The specimen is opened to
       reveal a papillary tumor measuring 3.0 Cm in length and 3.4 Cm in width. The
       tumor is located distal to the cecum, 3.2cm from the ileocecal valve, 14.8         cm from the proximal margin and 15.0 cm from the distal margin. Sectioning  
       shows that the tumor invades to a depth of 1.1cm grossly extending into the 
       muscularis.  The remaining mucosa is otherwise tan yellow and grossly       
       unremarkable. The attached adipose tissue is thoroughly examined and all    
       identified lymph nodes are submitted. Representative sections of the               specimen are submitted for permanent sections and for

"," Based on the pathology report, here are the categories with corresponding information:

1. Site: The site of the cancer is the colon. This is indicated by the term ""coli"" in the diagnosis.
2. Laterality: Not provided, as the report does not specify if the cancer occurred in a specific side or section of the colon.
3. Histology: The histological type of the cancer is tubulopapillar adenocarcinoma. This term appears multiple times throughout the report.
4. Stage: The cancer has metastasized to lymph nodes, as indicated by ""NO I/VIII"" and ""pN1."" Based on the TNM staging system, this suggests a stage II or III cancer.
5. Grade: The grade of the cancer is G2, which means it is moderately differentiated.
6. Behavior: The behavior of the cancer is malignant, as indicated by the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma and the presence of metastases.

Justification: These categories were chosen based on their relevance to understanding the nature and severity of the cancer. While laterality was not explicitly stated in the report, it can still be an important factor in determining treatment options.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"," Site: The prostate gland
Laterality: Not provided (No information about which side is affected)
Histology: Adenocarcinoma (Inferred from the mention of Gleason score)
Stage: pT2N0M0 (Organ confined, no lymph node involvement, no distant metastasis; however, this is an inference as staging information is not explicitly provided)
Grade: Gleason score 7 (3+4), indicating a moderately differentiated tumor
Behavior: Malignant (Inferred from the context of cancer diagnosis)

Justification: The report mentions ""Gleason score 7"" which refers to the histological grade of prostate adenocarcinoma. The absence of information about laterality and explicit staging details leads us to infer these categories based on common clinical practice and the provided information.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"," Based on the pathology report, the following categories can be determined:

1. Site: The colon. This is mentioned in multiple parts of the report, including the title and the description of the lymph nodes as ""LymphonoduliFs of the colon.""

2. Laterality: Not provided. There is no mention of laterality (right or left side) in the report.

3. Histology: Tubulopapillary and mucinous adenocarcinoma. This is specified in the title of the report as ""parFm mucinosum coli"" and ""tubulopapillar and parFally mucinous adenocarcinoma of the colon.""

4. Stage: pT2, pNO. These designations refer to the TNM staging system for cancer, with pT2 indicating that the tumor has grown into the muscle layer of the colon but not through it, and pNO meaning that there are no cancer cells in the lymph nodes.

5. Grade: G3. This indicates a high-grade or poorly differentiated tumor, which means that the cancer cells look very abnormal and are growing quickly.

6. Behavior: Malignant. This is implied by the fact that the report describes an adenocarcinoma, which is a type of cancer that starts in glandular tissue and can spread to other parts of the body.

Justification: The site, stage, grade, and behavior are explicitly stated or can be inferred from the report. The laterality is not mentioned, so it is marked as ""not provided."" The histology is determined by combining the information about the parFm mucinosum coli and the tubulopapillar and mucinous adenocarcinoma.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3. ""Histology"": Adenocarcinoma, as the report clearly states the histologic type of the tumor as adenocarcinoma.
4. ""Stage"": Not provided, as the report does not contain enough information to accurately determine the stage of the cancer. Stage is determined by several factors including the size of the tumor, whether it has invaded nearby tissues, and whether it has spread to other parts of the body.
5. ""Grade"": Moderately differentiated (Grade 2), as the report mentioned that the tumor shows moderately differentiated histology.
6. ""Behavior"": Malignant, as the report describes a cancerous tumor which is by definition malignant.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

       1) The specimen is received fresh and labeled, ""segment 2 and 3 of liver*"". 
       It consists of a liver lobe measuring 12x5.6x3.1 cm. The hepatic capsule is 
       grossly intact and is inked black. There is a rough hepatic resection margin

       colon"". It consists of a rectosigmoid colon that measures 18.0 x 6.3 cm at         the distal margin.  The serosal surface has an area of central retraction   
       and narrowing.  The affected serosa is inked blue the radial resection      
       margin is inked black and the specimen is opened to reveal a circumferential
       ulcerated tumor with heaped up borders that is located 5.7 cm from the      
       proximal margin and 6.5 cm from the distal margin. The tumor measures 5.8 cm       in length and 3.5 cm in width. Serial sectioning reveals tumor invasion to a
       depth of 1.2cm grossly extending through the muscularis into the pericolic  
       fat, 1.8cm from the radial margin but grossly abutting the retracted serosa.
        There is an underlying grossly positive lymph node which is 1.2 cm from the
       radial margin, which is submitted and an additional grossly positive lymph         node which is abutting the radial margin.  The muscularis proximal to the   
       tumor is thickened up to 0.6cm.  The remaining mucosa shows no other        
       discrete lesions and is otherwise unremarkable.  Pericolic and peri-rectal  
       adipose tissue is thoroughly examined for lymph nodes and three grossly

       It consists of a rectosigmoid colon that measures 15.5 cm in length and 5.4        cm in circumference. The open end indicates the proximal margin. The serosal
       surface is intact and grossly unremarkable. The radial resection margin is  
       inked black and the specimen is opened to reveal a tumor that is located 9  
       cm from the proximal margin and 4.5 Cm from the distal margin. The tumor    
       measures 1.5 Cm in length and 1.3 Cm in width. Serial sectioning reveals           tumor invasion to a depth of 0.2 Cm, which is 1.5 Cm from the closest radial
       margin. The remaining mucosa is unremarkable.  Pericolic and peri-rectal    
       adipose tissue is thoroughly examined for lymph nodes, and all possible     
       nodes are submitted. Representative sections are submitted. TPS is          
       submitted.

       1). The specimen is received fresh and is labeled ""sigmoid and upper        
       rectum"".  It consists of a rectosigmoid colon that measure 20 x 12 x 8 cm.  
       The radial resection margin is inked black and the serosa is inked blue.    
       The serosa shows a large area of retraction 7 cm from the distal margin.    
       The specimen is opened to reveal a circumferential, constricting tumor that        is located 11 cm from the proximal margin and 7 cm from the distal margin.  
       The tumor measures 5.5 cm in length and 3.5 cm in width.  Serial sectioning 
       reveals tumor invasion to a depth of 2.5 cm, which is 0.5 cm from the

       rectal tumor"" and consists of an oriented portion of rectal mucosa measuring
       5.8 cm (distal to proximal) x 3.7 cm (left to right) x 0.3 cm.  The mucosa  
       displays an red tan papillary lesion measuring 3.6 x 2.2 cm located 0.2 cm  
       -- right, 0.5 cm -- proximal, 0.1 cm -- proximal, 0.2 cm -- left from the          mucosal margin.  Gross photographs are taken.  TPS has been previously taken
       by the attending.  The left half is inked black, the right half is inked    
       blue.  Upon sectioning the lesion has yellow papillary extension to a depth 
       of 0.6 cm. Perpendicular sections of the distal and proximal margins are    
       submitted.  The remaining specimen is serially sectioned from distal to            proximal in its entirety.

       1) The specimen is received fresh labeled ""rectum and rectosigmoid"". It     
       consists of a rectosigmoid colon that measures 12.0 cm in length by 7.0 cm  
       in circumference at the distal resection margin. The serosal surface is pink
       and smooth. The radial resection margin is inked black and the specimen is  
       opened to reveal a pink-tan papillary tumor measuring 2.9 cm in length by          1.8 cm in width by 0.4 cm, located 3.5 cm from the distal resection margin. 
       There is a smooth sessile polyp measuring 0.4 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm, located 0.7 cm
       from the tumor, and 5.0 cm from the closest (distal) resection margin. There
       is a second pink-tan smooth sessile polyp measuring 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm,     
       located 1.2 cm from the tumor, and 3.2 cm from the distal resection margin         (arbitrarily designated P2). There is a third pink-tan smooth sessile polyp 
       measuring 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm, 1.0 cm distal to the tumor, and 1.8 cm from   
       the distal resection margin (arbitrarily designated P3). The three polyps   
       are blocked out and entirely submitted. The tumor is sectioned to reveal a  
       well defined pink-white extension to depth of 0.8 cm grossly not involving         the underlying fat, and 1.2 cm from the inked radial resection margin.      
       Representative sections of the tumor are submitted.  Remaining mucosa is    
       otherwise grossly unremarkable. The specimen is submitted for lymph nodes   
       and possible lymph nodes are submitted. TPS is taken.  Representative       
       sections are submitted.

       in circumference.  There is attached pericolic fat extending 6.2 cm in      
       length.  The mucosa reveals a central pink-tan smooth sessile polyp         
       measuring 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm, 2.8 cm from the nearest unoriented resection  
       margin. The polyp is blocked out entirely submitted. The remaining mucosa is       otherwise grossly unremarkable.

       consists of a rectosigmoid colon that measures 25 cm in length and 7 cm in  
       circumference. The serosal surface is smooth. The margins are inked as      
       follows: proximal and radial margins - blue, distal margin  black. The             specimen is opened to reveal a tumor that is located 11.5 cm from the       
       proximal margin and 3 cm from the distal margin. The tumor measures 7 cm in 
       length and 4 cm in width. Serial sectioning reveals tumor invasion to a     
       depth of 1.3 cm, which is 1.5 cm from the closest radial margin. The        
       remaining mucosa is unremarkable.  Pericolic and peri-rectal adipose tissue        is thoroughly examined for lymph nodes, and all possible nodes are          
       submitted. Representative sections are submitted. TPS is submitted.

       1).  The specimen is received fresh and is labeled ""Sigmoid and upper rectum
       stitch marks proximal."" It consists of a rectosigmoid colon that measures   
       19.0 x 7.5 cm. The serosal surface is smooth. The radial resection margin is
       inked black, and the specimen is opened to reveal a tumor that is located          12.5 cm from the proximal margin and 5.5 cm from the distal margin. The     
       tumor measures 6.8 cm in length and 8.5 cm in width. Serial sectioning      
       reveals tumor invasion to a depth of 0.9 cm, extending through the          
       muscularis grossly approaching into the underlying pericolic fat, which is

       including portion of left abdominal wall, left vas deferens, and gonadal    
       vessel.""  It consists of a rectosigmoid colon that measures 29 cm in length 
       and 8.5 cm in circumference at the distal margin. The serosal surface has a 
       4.5 x 4.0 x 2.5 cm soft tissue mass attached.  Identified adjacent to the          mass is 5.0 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm tubular structure consistent with vas deferens.  
       The surface of the mass is inked blue, and the radial resection margin is   
       inked black. The specimen is opened to reveal a tumor that is located 9.5 cm
       from the proximal margin and 13.0 cm from the distal margin. The tumor      
       measures 4.0 cm in length and 2.1 cm in width and has raised rolled borders.       Serial sectioning reveals that the tumor invades through the serosa into the

       - Immunohistochemical stains for DNA mismatch repair proteins have been     
       performed. The results are as follows:                                             MLH1:     staining present in tumor

       MSH6:     staining present in tumor                                         
       PMS2:     staining present in tumor                                         
       Conclusion: Immunohistochemical staining for the tested DNA mismatch repair        proteins is retained in the tumor.                                          
                                                                                   
       Some of the immunohistochemistry and ISH tests were developed and their     
       performance characteristics were determined by the Department of Pathology. 
       They have not been cleared or approved by the US Food and Drug                     Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is   
       not necessary. These tests are used for clinical purposes. They should not  
       be regarded as investigational or for research. This laboratory is certified
       under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of (CLIA '  as

"," Site: The specimen is taken from the large bowel, including a portion of the left abdominal wall, left vas deferens, and left gonadal vessel (Part 1). The distal anastomotic ring (Part 2) and proximal anastomotic ring (Part 3) are also examined.

Laterality: Left side of the body is affected, as evidenced by the removal of the left-sided abdominal structures (Part 1), distal anastomosis (Part 2), and proximal anastomosis (Part 3).

Histology: The tumor shows features of adenocarcinoma. This is supported by the description of glandular differentiation in the submitted report.

Stage: The stage of the cancer is not explicitly provided in the document, but it can be inferred based on the surgical procedure and pathological findings (e.g., depth of invasion, lymph node involvement).

Grade: The tumor grade is not explicitly mentioned in the report; therefore, it remains unknown.

Behavior: The behavior of this adenocarcinoma is concerning for malignancy due to its propensity for local invasion and distant metastasis. This is based on the general understanding of adenocarcinomas as potentially aggressive neoplasms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clinical Diagnosis & History:
History of retroperitoneal liposarcoma initially status post resection
now with recurrence.
Specimens Submitted:
1: Left radical nephrectomy left colectomy resection of psas and illiacus
muscle
2: Small bowel
3:Mesenteric nodule
4: Abdominal scar
DIAGNOSIS:
1.Left nephrectomy left colectomy resection of psas and illiacus muscle,
radical resection:
-Recurrent high grade dedifferentiated liposarcoma ,involving left
colon wall ,encasing left kidney and ureter.
-The tumor has a multinodular growth pattern, the largest nodule
measuring 18.5 x 15 .5 x 12.0 cm.
-The dedifferentiated component shows a high grade
myxofibrosarcoma -like morphology ,comprising >50% of the mass.
-Tumor necrosis is present ,estimated as 25% grossly.
-Tumor is surrounded grossly by a thin membrane which represents the
surgical resection margin.
-Colon,ureter,and renal vascular margins are free of tumor.
-Muscle tissue is not involved by tumor.
-Renal parenchyma with glomerulosclerosis and non -specific interstitial
inflammation.
2.Small bowel, resection:
-Focalareasof scarring.
-Serosa with fibrosis, adhesion, mild acute and chronic inflammation.
-No evidence of malignancy.
3.Soft tissue ,Mesenteric nodule, biopsy:
-Nodule of mature adipose tissue with scattered hyperchromatic stromal
cells,consistent with well -differentiated liposarcoma (1.2 x1.0 x 0.5 cm).
4.Abdominal scar ,excision:
-Dermal scar with acute and mild chronic inflammation.

I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF
THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL), AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED
THIS REPORT.
*** Report Electronically Signed Out ***
GrossDescription:
1). The specimen is received fresh and labeled ""Resection of psoas and
iliacus muscle, left radical nephrectomy, left colectomy"". It consists of
a soft tissue massmeasuring 18.5 x 15.5 x 12.0 cm, a segment of colon (9.5
cm long, 5.5 cm in circumference), left kidney (9.5 x 4.5 x 3.0 cm) with
attached ureter (16 cm long, 0.8 cm in diameter),and a small fragment of
muscle tissue (5.5 x 3.0 x 0.8 cm). The specimen weighs 2033 grams in total.
The large soft tissue massis encapsulated by a thin layer of fibrous tissue
that is easily separated from the mass. The cut surface is sold, lobulated,
soft, variegated including tan-yellow, to yellow-white, to friable gray. The
friable dusky area occupies roughly 25% of the mass. The mass adheres to the
colon wall through its fibrous capsule without grossly invading into it. The
colonic mucosa is tan-pink and flat. The mass also adheres to the distal
segment of the ureter, spanning 6 cm, through its capsule. The ureter is not
grossly involved by the tumor. Sectioning of the kidney and the perirenal
adipose tissue reveals two additional lobulated tumors, most likely
contiguous with the main mass,being attached to the lower pole and in the
hilum, separated by 2.5 cm. The sizes of these nodular masses are 8.4 x 6.5
x 3.8 and 3.5 x 3.0 x 2.0 cm respectively with homogenous tan-yellow cut
surface. Both are encapsulated by thin capsules. Neither of the two tumors
is invading into the renal parenchyma. The renal parenchyma is thinned
ranging from 1.5 to 2.5 cm. The renal pelvis and calyces are mildly dilated.
The muscle tissue is attached to superior and posterior aspect of the
kidney and is 2.0 cm from closest tumor. No adrenal tissue is grossly
identified. The specimen is photographed. Sections of the tumor and normal
kidney and perirenal fat are submitted for TPS. Representative sections are
submitted for permanent.
Summary all sections:
UM - distal ureteral margin and renal vascular margin
PCM - proximal colon resection margin
DCM - distal colon resection margin
Ti - largest tumor
TC -T1 to colon
TU -Ti to ureter
M - muscle tissue
T2 - tumor attached to lower pole
T3 - renal hilar tumor
T1T2fibroadipose tissue linked between two nodular areas
T2T3section in between two nodular areas
K random kidney

2)The specimen was received fresh ,labeled ""Small bowel"" and consists of an
unoriented segment of small bowel measuring 37.0 cm in length and ranging
from 4.0 to 7.5 cm in circumference .The serosa is pink purple focally

"," Based on the pathology report, here is the information organized into the six categories:

Site: The site of the cancer is the rectum.
Justification: The report consistently refers to the location of the tumor as the rectum.

Laterality: Not provided.
Justification: The report does not mention any laterality information, such as whether the tumor occurred on the left or right side of the rectum.

Histology: The histological type of the cancer is tubulopapillary adenocarcinoma.
Justification: The report clearly states that the tumor is a tubulopapillary adenocarcinoma.

Stage: The cancer has metastasized to regional lymph nodes, but the specific stage is not provided.
Justification: The report mentions that there are metastases in regional lymph nodes (N1), but it does not provide enough information to determine the T and M categories, which are necessary for staging.

Grade: The grade of the cancer is 2 (G2).
Justification: The report assigns a grade of 2 to the tumor, indicating moderate differentiation.

Behavior: The behavior of the cancer is malignant.
Justification: The report describes the tumor as a malignant neoplasm, indicating that it is a cancer with the potential to invade surrounding tissues and metastasize.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"," Based on the pathology report, here are the categories you requested:

1. Site: The site of the tumor is the rectum. This is mentioned in the histopathological diagnosis as ""tubular adenocarcinoma of the rectum.""

Justification: The site of the tumor is crucial for treatment planning and follow-up care.

2. Laterality: Not provided. The report does not mention whether the tumor occurred on the left or right side of the rectum.

Justification: Laterality is not always relevant, especially in organs like the rectum that do not have separate sides.

3. Histology: The histology of the tumor is tubular adenocarcinoma. This is mentioned in the histopathological diagnosis as ""tubular adenocarcinoma of the rectum.""

Justification: Histology provides important information about the type of cancer, which can influence treatment decisions and prognosis.

4. Stage: The tumor stage is Dukes B, Astler-Coller B2, pT3, pNO, and R0. These stages indicate that the tumor has penetrated the muscularis propria but has not invaded nearby organs or lymph nodes.

Justification: Stage is one of the most important prognostic factors in cancer and guides treatment decisions.

5. Grade: The grade of the tumor is G2, which means that it has a moderate degree of differentiation.

Justification: Grade provides information about the aggressiveness of the tumor and can influence treatment decisions.

6. Behavior: The behavior of the tumor is malignant, as indicated by the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma.

Justification: Behavior indicates whether the tumor is benign or malignant, which has important implications for treatment and prognosis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"," Based on the pathology report, the six categories are:

1. Site: Rectum - The report consistently refers to adenocarcinoma of the rectum.
2. Laterality: Not provided - The concept of laterality does not apply to the rectum as it is a midline structure.
3. Histology: Tubular adenocarcinoma - The report clearly states ""Adenocarcinoma tubulare"" and ""Tubular adenocarcinoma of the rectum.""
4. Stage: III/VIII - Although the report mentions metastases in lymph nodes regionalis (regional lymph nodes) without specifying the number, it can be inferred that the stage is at least III.
5. Grade: G2 - The report clearly states ""Adenocarcinoma tubulare (G2).""
6. Behavior: Malignant - The report indicates a cancer diagnosis, and the context implies this is an invasive malignancy.

Justification: The information was extracted from a pathology report written in a medical language consistent with these categories.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"," Based on the pathology report, here are the categories with available information:

1. Site: Rectum - This is specified in the first line of the diagnosis.
2. Laterality: Not provided - The location in the rectum is not specified, and no mention of laterality is made.
3. Histology: Tubular and mucinous adenocarcinoma - This is clearly stated in the diagnosis.
4. Stage: pT3 pN1 R0 - This indicates a locally advanced cancer with regional lymph node metastases but clear resection margins.
5. Grade: G3 - This suggests a high-grade, aggressive tumor.
6. Behavior: Malignant - This is implied by the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma and the presence of metastases.

A. LEFT COLON  
 GROSS DESCRIPTION: 
A.  LEFT COLON:  
Received fresh for tissue procurement labeled with the patient's name and “left colon”, and “distal 
margin-double, single-proximal margin”,  is a segment of colon, 21.5 cm. in length, with an indurated 
serosal surface involving 8.5 cm. of its length, and a puckering in the region of a large mass bulging from the colonic surface.  The staples closing the proximal and distal ends are removed, and the colon 
is opened to reveal a circumferential tumor 4 cm in length, 6 cm in circumference, and 2.3 cm maximum 
height. The tumor is centrally ulcerated with heaped-up borders that are approximately 1 cm. above the mucosal surface.  The tumor is 9.5 cm. from the proximal margin and 7.8 cm. from the distal margin.  The circumference of the proximal bowel is 10 cm, the distal bowel 5.5 cm, and the circumference is 
narrowed to 3.7 cm. in the area of the tumor. The cut surface of the tumor is tan-white, and t he central 
ulcerated area is coated with purulent material.  There is a polypoid projection of the mucosa at the 
distal edge of the tumor measuring 0.4x0.6 cm., raised above the mucosal surface 0.7 cm.  In the region of serosal puckering, the tumor is 1.2 cm. deep, and appears to extend through the muscularis 
and into the subserosal fat.  Adjacent to this area there are three tan-white nodules in the subserosal 
fat, 1.1 cm., 1 cm. and 0.7 cm. in maximum dimension.  Two additional nodules are identified in t he 
  
subserosal fat 1.1 cm. in maximum dimension.  The mucosa surrounding the tumor is tan- pink, normally 
folded, with no masses or polyps identified.  Multiple possible lymph nodes are identified in the attached 
fat.  Representative sections are submitted as follows:  
A1: proximal margin, 2 pieces  
A2: distal margin

"," Site: Cecum
Laterality: Right
Histology: Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma arising in a serrated adenoma
Stage: pT2 N1 Mx (T2 indicates tumor has invaded the muscularis propria, N1 indicates metastasis in 3 out of 44 lymph nodes)
Grade: G2 (Moderately differentiated)
Behavior: Infiltrating and malignant, with positive surgical margins and lymph node metastases.

The reason for the categorization is as follows:

* Site: The tumor was found in the cecum, which is the first part of the large intestine (colon) on the right side of the body.
* Laterality: As the tumor is located in the right colon, it is considered a right-sided colon cancer.
* Histology: The tumor is a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma arising from a serrated adenoma.
* Stage: Based on the TNM staging system, the tumor has invaded the muscularis propria (pT2), with metastasis in 3 out of 44 lymph nodes (N1). The M category is not provided, indicating that distant metastases were not found.
* Grade: The tumor is moderately differentiated (G2), which means it has some degree of glandular formation and cell differentiation.
* Behavior: The tumor is infiltrating and malignant, with positive surgical margins and lymph node metastases, indicating a high risk for recurrence and requiring further treatment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GROSS DESCRIPTION:  
A. RIGHT AND TRANSVERSE COLON  
Received fresh and labeled ""right transverse colon"", it consists of a right hemicolectomy with a portion 
of terminal ileum.  The segment of terminal ileum measures 7.0 cm in length.  The right colon measures 33.0 cm in length.  The proximal (ileal) surgical margin measures 3.5 cm in circumference, and the 
distal (colonic) surgical margin measures 8.0 cm in circumference.  An appendix is identified and 
measures 5.5 cm in length x 0.6 cm in width.  Upon opening the specimen, a tumor mass is identified, 
located 7.0 cm from the distal surgical margin.  This mass is tan colored, measures 4.0 x 4.0 x 1.1 cm and has heaped-up edges around its periphery, without obvious central ulceration.  In addition to the 
primary mass, there are several minute (0.2 to 0.4 cm in diameter) polypoid lesions, 3- 4 in the proximal 
ascending colon (proximal to the primary mass) and 1 in the distal aspect  of the specimen (distal to the

 COMMENT:  The liver nodule shows a proliferation of relatively bland epithelioid cells separated by a 
fibrovascular stroma.  Unfortunately, the tissue is largely absent on permanent sections and can only be 
seen well on the frozen section.  Ancillary studies like IHC are not possible.  The epithelioid cells may represent histiocytes or potentially a hyperplastic mesothelial proliferation.  There is no evidence of carcinoma, and I favor a benign process in this nodule.  Correlation with clinical findings is 
recommended.  
 Microsatellite instability testing has been ordered on the colon tumor.  Those results will be issued in a separate report.

A.  RIGHT COLON, TERMINAL ILEUM  
Received fresh for tissue procurement is a segment of terminal ileum with attached right colon.  The 
terminal i leum is 4 cm in length and 4 cm in circumference and is grossly unremarkable.  A segment of 
the right colon is 25 cm in length and 9.5 cm in maximum circumference.  The serosal surface is tan-pink, smooth and grossly unremarkable.  The attached appendix is  7 cm in length and 0.4 cm in 
diameter and shows unremarkable external and cut surfaces.  The specimen is opened and shows a 4.2 x 3 x 0.6 cm tumor mass with central ulceration located at the mid portion of the right colon at 8 cm from the closest (distal margin) and 12.5 cm from the ileo-cecal valve.  This lesion involves the portion of the colon which is not covered with serosa. It  invades through the muscularis into the subserosa.  A 
second polypoid lesion is identified in the area corresponding to the base of the appendix.  This lesion 
measures 2.5 x 2.3 x 0.7 cm.  Sectioning shows the lesion to be confined to the mucosa without definite 
evidence of invasion.  The remainder of the colon shows an unremarkable tan pink mucosa.  Throughout the pericolic adipose tissue, multiple presumptive lymph nodes are identified ranging 
between 0.3 and 0.6 cm in greatest dimension.  All the lymph nodes and representative sections of the 
specimen are submitted as follows:

B.Received fresh labeled with the patient's nameand ""splenic flexure colon lesion"" with
tissue bank coordinator in attendance is a 12 cm segmental resection of large bowel which
measures 4cm in diameter.requests gross evaluation for margins. Both the
surgical margins are stapled and not clinically designated.Tattoo pigment is noted which
abuts one staple line. The adipose tissue is wrapped around the serosa in the mid portion.
Blue ink is applied to this area. The tattoo stapled margin measures 5cm in length and
opposite margin measures 3.5 cm in length. The mesenteric margin measures 3 cm. Blue ink
is applied to this margin. In trying to separate the mesentery from the bowel, it is found
to be adherent to the bowel surface. There is some fatty tissue present on the opposite
side which may be inclusive of some omental type tissue. The margins are removed and the
Lumen probed revealing an obstructing masspresent. The tumor measures 6 cm in length, it
involves the entire circumference of the bowel wall. It lies 2.5 cm from the tattooed
margin and 2 cm from the opposite margin. A portion of the edge of the tumor and
non-neoplastic mucosa is provided to the tissue bank coordinator. The specimen is pinned
out onto a corkboard for several hours of formalin fixation. The partial fixed specimen is
serially sectioned revealing that the tumor extends deep into the muscle wall, possibly
extending through the muscle wall.A subjacent lymph node is identified measuring 1 cm.
The pericolic/mesenteric adipose tissue was placed in a 50/50 solution of lymph node
revealing solution and formalin.On cross section, several lymph nodes are identified
which range from 0.4 to 1 cm in greatest dimension each. No omental nodules are
identified.

A&C.These biopsies of the left lobe of the liver show focal granulomatous inflammation
with fibrosis.The granulomas are mostly noncaseating, composed of epithelioid
histiocytes, multinucleated giant cells and a sprinkling of small lymphocytes.These
granulomas are set in a fibrous stroma. A few of the granulomas have scant central
necrosis but most are noncaseating.AFB and GMS stains are obtained on both biopsies. Noorganisms are seen.
D.This is a piece of adipose tissue containing a sclerotic, partially calcified nodule
compatible with fat necrosis,There is no evidence of metastatic carcinoma,
B.Sections of the obstructing tumor demonstrate a moderately differentiated
adenocarcinoma which invades through the bowel wall, not quite reaching the subjacent
mesenteric lymph node. Discontinuous invasion is noted.No metastasis are identified in10 regional lymph nodes,

Case Is tci cl,"," Site: Splenic flexure of the colon
Justification: The specimen is labeled as a ""splenic flexure colon lesion"" and the gross description includes an obstructing mass in this location.

Laterality: Not provided
Justification: The report does not mention the laterality of the tumor.

Histology: Adenocarcinoma
Justification: The diagnosis from the frozen section is ""necrotizing granulomatous inflammation - negative for carcinoma,"" while the final diagnosis from the permanent sections is ""moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.""

Stage: pT3 N0
Justification: The pathologic staging indicates a primary tumor that has invaded through the muscularis propria into the subserosal adipose tissue (pT3) and no regional lymph node involvement (N0).

Grade: Low-grade
Justification: The report mentions ""low-grade"" in the description of the tumor, but it is not clear if this refers to the grade or the differentiation. If low-grade refers to differentiation, then high-grade would be a more appropriate term for moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.

Behavior: Malignant
Justification: The tumor is an adenocarcinoma, which is by definition a malignant neoplasm.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

COMMENT(S)
The large mass involving the cecum is an invasive adenocarcinoma with areas of mucinous
differentiation noted.While most of the tumor is low grade, there are microscopic foci
where the tumor is of a higher histologic grade. The tumor extends into the proximal
appendix as well as involves the subserosa of the distal ileum. The patient's carcinoma
will be further evaluated for KRAS mutation and mismatch repair defect (by IHC).
Additional reports will follow.

Diagnosis Discrepancy
Primary Tumor Site Discrepancy
HtPAA Discrepancy
r"," Site: Cecum
Justification: The report clearly states that the tumor is located in the cecum, which is a pouch-like structure that connects the small and large intestines.

Laterality: Not provided
Justification: The report does not mention any laterality information, such as whether the tumor is located on the right or left side of the body.

Histology: Adenocarcinoma
Justification: The report states that the tumor is an adenocarcinoma, which is a type of cancer that starts in glandular cells.

Stage: pT4a, N0, M1a
Justification: The report provides information about the tumor stage using the TNM system, which stands for Tumor, Node, and Metastasis. In this case, the tumor has invaded the serosa (pT4a), there are no cancer cells in the regional lymph nodes (N0), and there is evidence of distant metastasis to the liver (M1a).

Grade: Low-grade
Justification: The report states that the tumor is low-grade, which means that it is composed of relatively well-differentiated cells that resemble normal tissue.

Behavior: Malignant
Justification: The report describes the tumor as a carcinoma, which is a type of cancer that tends to invade surrounding tissues and spread to other parts of the body. Therefore, it is considered malignant.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

22.0 x 12.0 x 1.7 cm portion of yellow. lobulated, omental adipose. The attached omentum
makes the specimen consistent with transverse colon. The segment of bowel is received
unoriented between proximal and distal. There is a focal area of serosal puckering with
""creeping fat"". The areais inked blue and the bowel is opened to have a centrally
ulcerated. 4.5 x 4.0 cm tumor mass.The tumor massis nearly circumferential and has
raised, rolled borders. The tumor comes to within 5 cm of one margin and 2.5 cm of the
opposite margin .The tumor diffusely involves the bowel wall and focally extends through
the bowel wall to superficially invade the underlying yellow adipose. The tumor focally
appears to abut the inked serosa. There is 2.5 cm of yellow adipose between the tumor and
the mesenteric fat resection margin. The surrounding mucosa is unremarkable with normal,
tan folds. The fat is sectioned and scant, possible lymph nodes are identified.
Representative sections are sampled as labeled:

COMMENT(S)
The subtotal colectomy contained two separate but histoicgically indistinguishable,
moderately differentiated adenocarcinomas. Tumor #1 was located in the cecum and appeared
more advanced with numerous metastasis to regional lymph nodes. Tumor #2 was located in
the siamoid colon without regional lymph node metastasis. In completing the synoptic
reports below. I judged the metastatic tumor to be associated with the more advanced cecal
adenocarcinoma.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
Specimen A is received in the fresh state labeled ""subtotal colectomy with left tube and
ovary"". The specimen consists of the following:
15 cm of terminal ileum measuring 2 cm in diameter
vermiform appendix measuring 5 cm in length by 0.7 cm in diameter
-65 cm of large intestine measuring approximately 5 cm in diameter
Attached omentum measuring 20 x 14 by up to 2 cm in thickness
An ovary and fallopian tube attached in the area of the sigmoid colon
-Mesentery measuring up to 9 cm in radial dimension at the ileocecal ;unction and
up to 9 cm in radial dimension at the sigmoid colon
Adhesions are noted at the ileocecal junction and between the ovary and sigmoid colon,
There are firm tumorous nodules in the mesentery at the ileocecal ;unction and in the
omentum.The omental tumor nodule measures 2 cm in greatest dimension. There are multiple
mesenteric nodules at the ileocecal junction measuring up to 1.5 cm in greatest dimension.
The bowel is opened to reveal a circumferential fungating tumor in the cecum approximately
2cm from the ileocecal valve.This tumor measures 4 5 cm along the length of the bowel.
The bowel is narrowed in this area. A second circumferential fungating mucosal tumor is
identified 5 cm above the distal margin. This second tumor measures 5.5 cm along the
length of the bowel and again the bowel appears narrowed in this area. The attached ovary
appears enlarged, measuring 5 x 4.5 x 3 cm. It has a smooth tan surface. Its cut surface
reveals soft tan tumorous tissue replacing 90% of the ovary. The fallopian tube with
fimbriated end measures 4.5 cm in length by 0.5 cm in diameter. The initial gross features
are reported to Dr in the O.R. atThe specimen is allowed to
fix overnight prior to sectioning.Representcuav'- sections are submitted as follows:

Addendum Comment
The purpose of this addendum is to report results following deeper levels
and an immunohistochemistry stain for Pancytokeratin on a lymph node in
section G35 due to a small fibrotic focus seen on the routinely stained
slide.
No metastatic carcinoma is seen in the additional deeper levels of the lymph
node in section G35 .An immunohistochemistry stain for Pancytokeratin is
negative ;the control is appropriate .The diagnoses remain unchanged.
This immunohistochemistry test(s )was developed and its performance
characteristics determined by the
Immunohistochemistry Laboratory and/or affiliated institution. It has not
been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration .The FDA
has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary .This test
is used for clinical purposes. It should not be regarded as investigational
or for research .This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory
Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) as qualified to perform high
complexity clinical laboratory testing.

Pathology Resident
Part F: Received in formalin labeled ""HERNIA SAC "" is a 6.0 x 6.0 x 3.5 cm
tan-yellow ,lobulated portion of adipose tissue with an attached fibrous
membrane focally adherent to fat .The specimen is serially sectioned to
reveal tan-yellow ,lobulated and glistening adipose tissue with no grossly
identifiable lesions. One representative section is submitted in cassette
F.
Part G: Received in formalin labeled ""SIGMOID COLON AND PARTIAL BLADDER"" is
a 31.0 cm in length and a diameter ranging from 5 .0 to 6.5 cm segment of
colon marked with a stitch indicating the proximal end, as oriented by the
surgeon ,with an attached 11.0 x 10.5 x 8.0 cm firm, round mass, displaying
a 5.0 x 4.5 cm ovoid ,hemorrhagic ,irregular area most likely compatible
with bladder mucosal resection margin (previously sent for frozen )located
towards the distal colonic end. The specimen has an attached 28.0 x 19.0 x
1.5 cm portion of mesenteric fat.
The colonic serosa is tan-gray and granular adjacent to the bladder
attachment site. Additionally there are multiple inconspicuous, thin,
irregular foci of possible fibrin deposition disseminated all over the
specimen. The mass has minimally attached adipose tissue with focal
tan-gray granular areas of possible fibrin deposition.
There is a 9.5 x 6.0 cm tan-pink, focally friable, exophytic tumor involving
the colonic mucosa circumferentially with focal areas of superficial
necrosis and hemorrhage, located at 3.5 cm from the distal resection margin
and at 15.0 cm from the proximal resection margin. A perpendicular section
through the mass reveals continuity with the circumferential colonic mass extending through a thick muscular wall, having up to 1.9 cm in thickness.
This wall likely represents urinary bladder wall. The bulk mass of tumor
present outside the colon measures 9.5 x 7.0 x 6.0 cm. The mass is grossly
extending through the entire colonic wall thickness minimally penetrating
grossly into the pericolonic adipose tissue, at 0.5 cm from the serosal
lining. The tumor infiltrates the muscular wall, at 1.5 cm from the bladder
mucosal margin and at 0.4 cm from the outer bladder wall surface (purple
ink) towards the proximal colon end.

Microscopic Description
A-F: Performed.
G: Sections show a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma composed of
highly irregular, tightly packed glandular structures with pleomorphic
nuclei involved by extensive areas of necrosis, desmoplastic reaction and
chronic inflammation. The tumor is surrounded by adenomatous colonic mucosa
with tubulovillous architecture. The tumor seems to invade the sigmoid
colon wall and penetrates into the muscular bladder wall extending close to
the bladder mucosal urothelium, but without directly involving it. The
bladder mucosa shows extensive hemorrhagic cystitis with subepithelial
hemorrhage and congestion and extensive inflammatory infiltrate and edema
within the mucosal lamina propria. There is extensive acute serositis
involving the peritoneum with submesothelial polymorphonuclear cells. This
acute inflammatory process involves the resection margins, as well. An area
of intramural colonic abscess is identified near the distal aspect
underlying the tumor.

Stage: The stage is not explicitly provided, but based on the description of tumor invasion into the sigmoid colon wall and muscular bladder wall, it is likely to be at least stage III.
Grade: The grade is moderately differentiated.
Behavior: Malignant, as it is an invasive adenocarcinoma.

The case describes a malignant tumor (adenocarcinoma) that has invaded the sigmoid colon wall and muscular bladder wall, with extensive associated inflammation and acute serositis. The tumor does not appear to directly involve the bladder mucosa, but there is extensive hemorrhagic cystitis in the bladder mucosa. Based on these findings, it is likely that this tumor is at least stage III, given the depth of invasion into the colon and bladder walls.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

COMMENT: There are deposits of tumor within lymph nodes and the fat
approaching the mesenteric margin, but tumor is not identified at the inked
margin. The 0.8 cm peritoneal nodule is a spindle cell tumor, and the
differential diagnosis includes a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) and
a leiomyoma. Immunohistochemical stains will be performed in order to
better characterize this lesion, and results will be issued in an addendum
report. The majority of the primary colon tumor has the pattern of a
conventional adenocarcinoma, with less than 50% having mucinous or signet
ring cell features.

--- --"," Site: The tumor is located in the rectosigmoid colon.

Laterality: Not provided as colorectal cancer can develop in both sides of the colon and does not typically show laterality.

Histology: The histologic type is adenocarcinoma, which is the most common type of colorectal cancer.

Stage: The pathologic staging (pTN) is pT3, pN1b, indicating that the tumor has invaded through the muscularis propria into the subserosa or nonperitonealized pericolic or perirectal tissues and has metastasized to 1-3 regional lymph nodes.

Grade: The histologic grade is well differentiated (G1), which means that the tumor cells are highly similar to normal cells and are growing slowly.

Behavior: The behavior of this tumor is malignant, as it invades surrounding tissues and has metastasized to regional lymph nodes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clinical History:
The patient is an -year-old female with colon cancer undergoing right
hemicolectomy.
Specimens Received:
A: Ileum , right colon, transverse colon ,omentum and lymph node
Gross Description:
A. The specimen is received in a single container labeled with the patient's
name, medical record number ,and additionally identified as, 'ileum, right colon, transverse colon, omentum and lymph node'. Received fresh and placed in
formalin is a hemicolectomy specimen composed of a 44 cm long and 3.2 cm
circumference segment of ileum attached to a 30 cm long and 8.3 cm circumference
segment of large bowel. There is a palpable mass in the cecum; the serosal
surface overlying this palpable mass is adherent to the serosal surface of the
transverse colon, forming a loop of large bowel.
The bowel is opened to reveal a partially fungating cecal mass, measuring 7.5 x
4.5 cm, which tunnels inward to a maximal extent of 5.3 cm, extending 3 cm into
the ileum. The mucosal surface of the adherent transverse colon is retracted
toward the mass but appears intact. The mass is located 25 cm from the proximal
resection margin, 3 cm from the distal resection margin, and 1.0 cm from the
apparent mesenteric margin. The serosa overlying the mass is inked black; the
mesenteric margin is inked red. On sectioning, the mass abuts the black inked
margin and does not invade into the wall of the adherent transverse colon.
The remaining mucosa demonstrates two nearby cecal polyps, measuring 0.7 and 1.7
cm in greatest dimension. The pericolonic adipose tissue is dissected for lymph
node candidates. Multiple lymph nodecandidates are identified. Appendix is not
identified. Additionally submitted with this specimen is a separate segment of
unoriented small bowel measuring 19 cm in length by 3.3 cm in internal
circumference; it is grossly unremarkable.

Clinical Information
The patient is a -year-old male with clinical diagnosis of colon cancer, undergoing
laparoscopic right hemicolectomy.
Gross Description
A. The specimen is received fresh intraoperatively for consultation from , labeled with
the patient's name and designated on the requisition as ""right colon, frozen for margins, rest
routine,"" and consists of a segment of right colon measuring 6.5 cm in length and averaging 5
cm in diameter with an attached portion of ileum, measuring 8.5 cm in length and averaging 3
cm in diameter. The appendix is present and measures 7.2 x 1.2 x 1.0 cm and appears slightly
dilated in its midportion. The specimen is opened to reveal a large polypoid fungating mass,
measuring 11.2 x 6.8 x 1.9 cm, which involves the cecum and a small portion of the terminal
ileum. The mass is 8 cm from the proximal margin at its closest point and 6.5 cm from the distal
margin at its closest point. A shave of the distal margin is frozen. The frozen section diagnosis
by is ""DISTAL MARGIN ,NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA."" The intraoperative
consultation diagnosis is communicated to the operating room at .After
frozen section, the area under the tumor is inked black and the tumor is serially sectioned to
reveal that it appears to extend through the colonic wall and into the pericolonic fat, but not to
the inked margin. Additionally, there is a large mass, consistent with matted lymph nodes, in
the pericolonic fat, which measures 6.5 x 4.5 x 3.5 cm. The specimen is representatively
submitted as follows:
1-2 - shave of distal margin (frozen residues)
3 - shave of proximal margin
4 - base of appendix and tip, bisected
5 - representative sections from midsection of appendix (appears
dilated)

Case is ;Yrcg);"," Site: The primary tumor site is the colon, as described by the presence of a large polypoid mass in the cecal area.

Laterality: Not provided in the description.

Histology: Not explicitly stated, but the gross examination suggests an adenocarcinoma or similar malignant epithelial tumor due to the polypoid appearance and deep invasion into the muscle and soft tissue.

Stage: Based on the gross findings of deep invasion into the muscle and extension to the inked margin, it is likely that this tumor is at least stage II (T3 or T4) according to the TNM staging system for colon cancer. However, definitive staging would require microscopic examination and assessment of lymph node involvement.

Gross Description:
A.Received fresh and subsequently placed in formalin labeled with the patient's name and ""tumor""; is a 14.0 cm colectomy
specimen with a diameter of 4.5 cm and two stapled margins. The specimen is opened along the antimesenteric site to reveal a
large friable fungating mass measuring 7.0 x 7.0 x 5.0 cm, filling the cecum. The mass is 5.5 cm from the distal rection margin
and 4.5 cm from the proximal resection margin. The mass appears to be circumferential and due to the size of the mass, distorts
the specimen. There is an attached appendix, 10.0 cm in length with an average diameter of 0.7 cm. The appendix is serially
sectioned revealing a 0.2 cm lumen filled with brown soft fecal material. The appendix does not appear to be involved by the
mass. The appendiceal orifice is inked green. The distal margin is marked by a suture and is inked blue. The pericolonic fat
deep to the mass is inked black. The mass is sectioned to reveal an average thickness of 0.9 cm. The mass appears to extend
through the submucosal and into the wall. The mass focally replaces the wall and extends into the pericolonic fat. The remainder
of the mucosa is tan-pink with mucosal folds arranged in the usual manner, however, there is a 0.7 x 0.7 x 0.3 cm tan-pink polyp that
is 1.0 cm from the blue inked distal resection margin. Sectioning of the pericolonic fat reveals 13 possible lymph nodes ranging in
size from 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm to 1.3 x 1.2 x 1.0 cm. The remainder of the pericolonic fat is unremarkable.
