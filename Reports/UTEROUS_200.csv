CLINICAL HISTORY:
Malignant neoplasm of corpus uteri
GROSS EXAMINATION:
A. ""Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries"", received fresh for frozen
section and placed in formalin on is a 157
cm hysterectomy specimen with attached right and left adnexagmr . 1The uterine 3 2
serosa is tan-pink to red-brown and focally hemorrhagic. The cervix is 3.5 x
2.7 cm. The entocervical mucosa is gray-white, the cervical os is patent up
to 1.2 cm. The endocervical canal is obliterated by a tan-yellow to red-brown
necrotic fungating tumor mass which is 4.5 x 4 cm overall. The tumor mass
involves both the anterior and posterior endocervical canal. A representative
section of the anterior endocervical canal is submitted for frozen section as
AF1, the frozen section remnant is submitted in block Al. The endometrial
cavity is lined by tan granular endometrium which is 0.3 to 0.4 cm thick. The
tumor is minimally involving the posterior lower aspect of the endometrial
cavity. The endometrial cavity at the fundus displays a 3 x 1.8 cm
pedunculated polyp. Sectioning through the tumor reveals a tan-yellow to
tan-gray gritty cut surface which is approximately 1.5 cm thick at the
thickest myometrial region of up to 2 cm. The right ovary is 3.5 x 1.2 x 1
cm. The external surface is remarkable for several red-brown to gray fibrous
adhesions. The associated fallopian tube segment is 5 cm in length x 0.4 cm
in diameter. The serosal surface is remarkable for several intact paratubal
cysts. The left adnexa is remarkable for an abundant amount of gray
periadnexal soft tissue 4.8 x 3.5 x 2 cm. There is a segment of fallopiantube whichis 9 cm in length x 0.3 cm in diameter. Sectioning of the
periadnexal soft tissue reveals no identifiable ovarian parenchyma.

Page 3of3"," Site: Uterus
The report explicitly states that the tumor is located in the uterus.

Laterality: Not applicable
There is no indication of laterality in this report as it pertains to a location within the uterus which does not have a lateral aspect.

Histology: Endometrioid adenocarcinoma
The report clearly states that the tumor is an endometrioid adenocarcinoma.

Stage: IB (pT1b, N0)
The tumor has invaded more than half of the myometrium (pT1b), but there are no regional lymph node metastases (N0). According to FIGO staging for endometrial cancer, this would be classified as stage IB.

Grade: Grade 3
The tumor is described as a grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma.

GROSS EXAMINATION:
A. ""Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries (AF1)"", re ved fresh for
frozen section and transferred to formalin at 4M on is a 1B6 gram,
9.8 x 9.2 x 5.2 cm uterus. The cervix is amputated and per surgeon was
macerated during surgery. The separate portion of cervix measures 3.5 x 2.6 x
1.9 cm and demonstrates a tan smooth ectocervix with a 1.3 cm os. The
endocervical canal is covered with a tan-yellowmucosa which focally appears
friable. The endometrial cavity is 6.5 (cornu to cornu) x 7.3 cm (to point of
cervical amputation) is filled with a 7.8 x 5.5 x 2.1 cm friable fungating
mass. The tumor primarily involves the anterior wall but extends over the
fundus partially onto the posterior wall to within 1.1 cm of the amputation
site of the cervix. The tumor is focally necrotic and invades 1.1 cm into a
1.6 cm myometrium. A representative section of the tumor is frozen as AF1
(remnant Al). The remaining endometrium is tan and approximately 1 mm in
thickness. The myometrium which is on average 2 cm thick is tan and partially
trabeculated with one intramural white whorled nodule, up to 0.7 cm,
consistent with leiomyoma. The serosal surface is tan and smooth with no
gross abnormalities identified.
The right fallopian tube, 8.5 cm long is distally dilated to 1.7 cm in
diameter. Proximally, the diameter is 0.4 cm. The surface of the right
fallopian tube demonstrates focal yellow discoloration and opening the tube
reveals a cystically dilated tube with yellow studding of the luminal
surface. The cystic dilated portion is filled with brown-red liquid. The
right ovary, 3.5 x 1.5 x 1 cm, is grossly unremarkable. The left fallopian
tube, 8 cm long x 0.5 cm in diameter, and left ovary, 2.5 x 1.1 x 0.8 cm, are
grossly unremarkable.

COMMENT:
A representative block of the endometrial tumor (C8) is
submitted for immunohistochemical evaluation, given the presence
of tumor in both the endometrium and ovaries. The tumor shows
only scant scattered weak positive staining for WT1 and is
positive for E-cadherin. The predominant tumor in the
endometrium and the absence of strong positive staining for WT1
supports classification as a tumor of primary endometrial
origin.

Gross Description
1. The specimen labeled with the patient's name and as ""Omentum: Omentum"". It consists of a
large unoriented segment of omentum, measuring 24.0 x 10.0 x 1.5 cm (weighing 103.2 g-fresh).
Cross-sections appear homogeneously yellow-tan and focally hemorrhagic. No distinct nodules
or tumors are grossly identified.
1A-1 E representative sections submitted
2. The specimen, labeled with the patient's name and as ""Uterus: Uterus, cervix, bilateral
salpingo-oophorectomy"". The specimen is received fresh and subsequently placed in 10%
buffered formalin. It consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral ovaries and fallopian
tubes; weighing 128.9 g (fresh). The body of the uterus is slightly distorted and measures 9.0 cm
SI x 5.5 cm ML x 5.2 cm AP. The serosal surface is pink-tan, focally hemorrhagic and smooth.
The cervix has a maximum diameter of 2.0 cm. The cervical Os measures 0.4 cm in maximum
diameter and has a ""slit-like"" shape. The uterus is bivalved. Both endo/myometrial layers are not
of uniform thickness. There is a large tumor occupying the entire endometrial cavity, measuring
8.7 cm SI x 4.5 cm ML x 5.0 cm AP. The tumor extends from the endometrial cavity to the lower uterine segment and towards the exocervix. Gross invasion into the myometrium is identified.
The cut surface of the tumor appears pale-tan, focally hemorrhagic and partially necrotic. The
distance from the tumor to the closest margins are as follows: 1.4 cm from the anterior exocervix,
0.9 cm from the posterior exocervix and <0.1 cm from the closest serosal surface (posterior
aspect). The cervical canal is patent and shows small amounts of mucoid material. The cervix
reveals a few Nabothian cysts, the largest measuring 0.2 cm in diameter. All of the Nabothian
cysts are filled with tan gelatinous material. The right ovary measures 2.0 x 1.1 x 0.9 cm. The
surface of the right ovary appears tan and slightly nodular. Cross sections show corpus albicans.
Within the right parovarian tissue, one poorly defined nodule is identified measuring 0.4 x 0.3 x
0.3 cm. The cut surface of the nodule appears homogeneously white, solid and firm. The right
fallopian tube measures 5.0 cm in length x 0.7 cm in diameter. The surface of the right fallopian
tube appears pink-tan and smooth, showing one para tubular cyst measuring 0.2 cm in maximum
dimension (filled with white milky fluid). Cross sections appear pale-tan and grossly
unremarkable. The left ovary measures 1.9 x 1.1 x 0.8 cm. The surface of the left ovary appears
tan and slightly nodular. Cross sections show corpus albicans. The left fallopian tube measures
5.5 cm in length x 0.6 cm in diameter. The surface of the left fallopian tube appears pink-tan and
smooth. Cross sections appear pale-tan and grossly unremarkable. Multiple sections from both
ovaries/ fallopian tubes, as well as two pieces of the endometrial tumor have been taken for
tissue banking. Representative sections are submitted as follows:
2A section of left ovary/fallopian tube, previously submitted by research PA

Justification: The specimen is labeled as ""Uterus: Uterus, cervix, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy"" and the gross description confirms the presence of a tumor in the endometrial cavity.

Laterality: Not provided
Justification: The tumor is present in the uterus, which is a midline structure and does not have laterality.

Histology: Endometrial carcinoma
Justification: The gross description mentions a ""large tumor occupying the entire endometrial cavity"" and the pathologic staging confirms the presence of invasive carcinoma in the endometrium.

Stage: IIIB (pT3b pNO)
Justification: The pathologic staging indicates that the tumor has invaded the vagina, rectal or bladder wall, or pelvic wall(s), but there is no regional lymph node metastasis.

Grade: Not provided
Justification: The pathologic report does not mention the grade of the tumor.

-LS-The endometrial cavity is diffusely involved by high-grade serous carcinoma with focaltointraepithelial carcinoma present at the surface of residual uninvolved atrophic
endometrium. The tumor at the uterine cavity represents the largest tumor bulk and it
invades into the outer half of the anterior myometrium but does not directly extend to
the uterine serosa; there is concurrent multifocal microscopic serosal tumor deposits
present on the anterior serosal surface (not in contiguity with the intrauterine
tumor). There is focal tumor involvement of the ovarian surface with associated
parenchymal tumor nodules in both ovaries. The lumen of the right distal fallopian
tube and fimbria is extensively involved and extended by multinodular tumor deposit.
While it is possible that the high-grade serous may have originated from the right
distal fallopian tube or alternatively that the tumors in the uterus and the right
fallopian tube represent synchronous primaries, the distribution of the disease is
most in keeping with a uterine primary that subsequently metastasized to the different
extra-uterine sites.This is also supported by the immunostaining findings that both the uterine tumor and the right tubal tumor show only weak focal nuclear WT1
immunoreactivity, in contrast to the usually strong and diffuse WT1 immunoreactivity
observed in the great majority of primary ovarian/tubal serous carcinomas.
Clinical History as Provided by Submitting Physician:

Gross Description:
Received are four containers, each labelled with the patient's name, XXXXXXXXXXX and
demographics.
Container A is labelled RIGHT PELVIC LYMPH NODES and consists of multiple pieces of
fibrofatty tissue aggregating to 7 x 2.5 x 0.5 cm. Two lymph nodes are identified
within the fibrofatty tissue measuring 2 x 1.3 x 0.5 cm and 2 x 0.7 x 0.2 cm,
respectively and are submitted in toto in cassettes Al and A2. The remainder of the
fibrofatty tissue is submitted in cassettes A3 and A4.
Container B is labelled LEFT PELVIC LYMPH NODE and consists of multiple pieces of
fibrofatty tissue aggregating to 4.5 x 3 x 1 cm. Two lymph nodes are identified
within, one measuring 2 x 1 x 0.4 cm and the other measuring 1.9 x 0.8 x 0.4 cm. They
are sectioned and submitted in B1 and B2, respectively. The remainder of the
fibrofatty tissue is submitted in B3 and B4.
Container C is labelled UTERUS, CERVIX BILATERAL TUBES, AND OVARIES and consists of a
total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy specimen. The uterus measures
4.4 x 3.6 x 2.5 cm, left fallopian tube measures 5.6 x 0.5 cm, left ovary measures 2 x
1x 1.3 cm, right fallopian tube measuring 6 x 0.5 cm at its attachment site to the
uterus, dilating up to 1.5 cm at its fimbriated end, right ovary measuring 2 x 1 x 0.5
cm.
The serosal surface is tan-brown, smooth, shiny, and free of any adhesions. The
ectocervix measures 1.8 x 2.4 cm and it is covered by a glistening white mucosa. The
external os is slit-like and measures 0.7 cm. The endocervical canal measures 2.1 cm
and involved by a friable tumor in the proximal region. The same friable white
exophytic tumor is present, diffusely involving the endometrial cavity. On cute
sections, the tumor invades into the out half of the anterior myometrium (to within
0.3 cm of the serosal surface) but does not extend to the serosa.
Left fallopian tube is unremarkable. The left ovary is multinodular and cystic and
there are several golden areas which grossly resemble the appearance of corpora lutea.
The right fallopian tube has multiple nodules towards its fimbriated end, the largest
of which measures 1 cm in diameter. Cut sections through the nodules show a white,
soft mass with a central area of hemorrhage. These nodules appear to be mostly
contained within the lumen of the fallopian tube. There are also several cystic
spaces near the fimbriated end, the largest measuring 0.7 cm in diameter, filled with
a mucinous-like material. The right ovary is multinodular and golden in appearance,
and otherwise unremarkable. Representative sections are submitted as follows:
Cl-C2 -representative sections of left ovary
C3-C4 -representative sections of left fallopian tube
C5-C6 -right ovary submitted in toto
C7-C10 -Right fallopian tube mass, submitted in toto

Comment:This serous carcinoma is considered to be of endometrial origin
since morphology of tumor is the same in endometrium and
ovaries, endometrial tumor is large while ovarian is small, there is deep myometrial invasion and lymphovascular
space invasion, tumor involves bilateral ovaries, several small
foci are seen in each ovary, and there is ovarian surface
involvement as well as parenchymal involvement.
Immunohistochemical stain for CD31 supports both lymphovascular
space invasion and myometrial tumor with artifactual clearing
around invasive tumor foci.

This is a -year-old female with endometrial cancer.
Gross Description:
Specimen A is received in one appropriately labeled container,
additionally labeled ""omentum"" and consist of one aggregate of
yellow fatty omentum weighing 310 grams and measuring 15 cm x 16
cm x 7 cm. Sectioning through this omentum reveals at least 3
large tumor nodules measuring 11.5 x 4.0 x 1.5 cm; 6.5 x 3.0
x 1.5 cm; and 5.5 x 2.3 x 1.5 cm. The cut surface of these
nodules is yellow and firm. Representative sections of tumor are

Justification: The patient was diagnosed with endometrial cancer, and the pathology report shows involvement of both ovaries and the endometrium by serous carcinoma. The stage is determined based on the AJCC Pathologic Stage provided (pT3a), but FIGO stage grouping is not explicitly given in the report. The grade is also not provided, so it cannot be determined. The behavior of this tumor is malignant due to its invasive nature and the involvement of multiple sites.",Serous carcinoma,pT3a (based on AJCC Pathologic Stage),,Malignant (invasive serous carcinoma found in the ovary and endometrium),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DIAGNOSIS:
A. Uterus, hysterectomy: FIGO grade 1 (of 3) endometrial
adenocarcinoma, endometrioid and villoglandular type, is
identified
forming a mass (2.5 x 2.0 x 0.7 cm), located in the
posterior
uterine wall. The tumor invades 0.6 cm into the
myometrium (total
wall thickness 1.8 cm). Lymphovascular space invasion is
not
identified. The tumor does not involve the endocervix.
The margins
are negative for tumor.
B. Fallopian tube, left, salpingectomy: The left
fallopian tube is
without diagnostic abnormality.
C. Ovary and fallopian tube, right, salpingo-
oophorectomy: The
right ovary and fallopian tube are without diagnostic
abnormality.
Frozen section histologic interpretation performed by:
M.D.
ED. Ovary, left, oophorectomy: The left ovary is without
diagnostic
abnormality.
E. Lymph nodes, right pelvic, lymphadenectomy: Multiple
(12) right
pelvic lymph nodes are negative for tumor. Frozen section
histologic interpretation performed by:
M. D.
F. Lymph nodes, left pelvic, lymphadenectomy: Multiple
(22) left pelvic lymph nodes are negative for tumor.
With available surgical material [AJCC pTlaNO] (7th
edition, 2010).
This final pathology report is based on the
gross/macroscopic
examination and frozen section histologic evaluation of
the
specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent
sections are
reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive
changes
identified on permanent section review will be reflected
in a
revised report.
GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. Received fresh labeled ""uterus"" is a 105.0 gram uterus
without
attached bilateral tubes and ovaries. The uterine serosa
is

------END OF REPORT------"," Site: Uterus
Laterality: Not provided (as it is a sample from a hysterectomy, which involves removing the entire uterus)
Histology: Endometrioid adenocarcinoma
Stage: Not explicitly provided, but based on the description of lymph node involvement, it may be at least stage II

Behavior: Malignant (based on the diagnosis of endometrioid adenocarcinoma)

Justification: The site is identified as the uterus based on the description of the specimen. The laterality is not provided, but it is not relevant in this case since a hysterectomy involves removing the entire uterus. The histology is given as endometrioid adenocarcinoma, which is a type of malignant tumor that arises from the endometrium. The stage is not explicitly provided, but based on the description of lymph node involvement, it may be at least stage II. The grade is given as FIGO Grade 2, which indicates an intermediate level of differentiation for the tumor cells.

DIAGNOSIS:
A.soft tissue, left paracolic gutter nodule, excision: Metastatic
carcinosarcoma.
B.uterus, left and right fallopian tubes and ovaries, hysterectomy
and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy: Malignant mixed Mullerian
tumor, with 80% glandular, 20% stromal differentiation, is
identified forming a lobulated polypoid mass (3.7 x 3.4 x 2.4 cm).
The tumor does not involve cervix. No invasion into the myometrium.
Lymphovascular space invasion is identified. The tumor involves
the anterior uterine serosa (0.3 cm nodule) and the left fallopian
tube serosa (0.2 cm nodule). There is endometriosis on the right
ovarian surface and in the uterine cul de sac. There are multiple
(5 subserosal, ranging in size from 0.3 cm to 7.0 cm in greatest
dimension; 10 submucosal, ranging in size from 0.1 cm to 2.4 cm in
greatest dimension; 6 intramural, ranging in size from 0.3 cm to 2.0
cm in greatest dimension) leiomyomata in the myometrium. The cervix

I certify that I personally conducted the diagnostic evaluation of the abovespecimen (s) and have rendered the above diagnosis(es).
COMMENT :
It is not possible to determine a primary site with certainty. The
endometrial tumor is non-invasive ,while the ovarian tumor is primarily on the
surface. Given that the endometrium has the largest single deposit of
carcinoma (4.0 cm)compared with the small volume of tumor at the otherinvolved sites ,however, an endometrial primary is favored.
ADDENDUM 1:
The tumor is unreactive for Wilm's tumor gene (WT-1), which supports the
other pathology findings that the primary tumor is endometrial in origin.
See Hashi A et al, Wilms tumor gene immunoreactivity in primary serous
carcinomas of the fallopian tube ,ovary, endometriam ,and peritoneum.

Comments
Sections of endometrium demonstrate a predominantly endometrioid
adenocarcinoma with focal clear cells and focal mucinous
differentiation .This Is graded as a moderate to poorly
differentiated, FIGO grade 2-3. Sections of cervix and right
parametrium show fragments of carcinoma outside of the plane of
sections of the tumor which are interpreted as ""floaters.""
The right ovary grossly was multi -cystic. Microscopically, a large
portion of the cyst demonstrate the lining epithelium to be
artifactually denuded . Focally, some residual lining epithelium is
present with focally some mucinous cells and in other areas columnar
epithelial cells. Focally , within the wall is some bone formation
as well as skin adnexal structures although no squamous epithelium
is identified . The overall histologic features are suggestive of a
mature cystic teratoma. No carcinoma is identified . Clinical
correlation and follow up is recommended.
At the request of the undersigned pathologist, these slides have
been additionally reviewed by Dr. IM who concurs with the
diagnosis.
This test has been finalized at the Campus.

COMMENT :The keratin positivity noted in the prior biopsy is entirely consistent with
leiomyosarcoma .Although some foci (A15) showed cells which resemble
rhabdomyoblasts ,MyoD1 is negative .No glandular component is identified in the
resection specimen and no keratin positivity is identified in a section stained from this
case ,which argue against a malignant mixed mullerian tumor .The findings were relayed

A. UTERUS, BILATERAL TUBES, OVARIES AND CERVIX
Labeled with the patient 's name ,labeled ""uterus, bilateral tubes ,ovaries and cervix "",received fresh for
intraoperative gross consultation, and subsequently fixed in formalin is a 190 gram total hysterectomy
and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy specimen. The uterus is about 7.5 x 6.0 x 6.0 cm. The cervical
portion of the uterus is 2.5 x 2.5 x 2.2 cm. The endometrial cavity is about 4.0 cm wide and about 4.0 cm
in length. The endometrial lining is 0.1 cm. The muscular uterine wall ranges from 1.2 to 2.0 cm in
maximum thickness. There are parametrial tissues attached to the uterus. Those on the right are about
2.5 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm and hose on the left are about 2.5 x 12 x 0.8 cm. The right ovary is. 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm.
A 1.3 x 0.7 x 02 cm portion of right ovary appears to have been previously removed for research
purposes. The right fallopian tube is 4.5 cm in length and 0.3-0.5 cm in diameter. The lumen is 0.1 cm.
The left ovary is 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm. The left fallopian tube is 4.5 cm in length and 0.4-0.6 cm in diameter.
The lumen is 0.1 cm.
There is a soft, tan, friable, hemorrhagic, pedunculated 5.5 x 5.0 x 3.5 cm endometrial tumor that largely
replaces the uterine fundus, corpus, and lower uterine segment. The tumor invades greater than 95% of
the myometrial wall in the lower uterine segment (grossly 2.0 cm into a 2.0 cm myometrial wall), The
tumor abuts the serosa of the anterior and posterior lower uterine segment but does not grossly extend
through the serosa. The tumor does not grossly extend into the ectocervix or parametrial soft tissues. A
1.0 x 0.7 x 0.3 cm nodule is present in the posterior endocervical wall, possibly representing tumor versus
post-fixation artifact. The endocervical canal is otherwise uninvolved by tumor. No metastatic tumor is
identified in the adnexa.

Laterality: Bilateral (both ovaries and fallopian tubes are involved)
Histology: Mixed endometrioid and serous carcinoma
Stage: pT2Nx (based on the depth of myometrial invasion and lack of lymph node information)
Grade: Grade 3
Behavior: Malignant (the patient was diagnosed with a malignancy, as evidenced by the involvement of multiple sites)

Justification: The patient was diagnosed with endometrial carcinoma in the uterus, which has extended to the cervix and lower uterine segment. There is also evidence of tumor involvement in both ovaries, fallopian tubes, and the omentum. Based on this information, the cancer is considered malignant, with a high grade and extensive spread throughout multiple sites.

Comment
Tumor demonstrated two architectural pattern with glandular and papillary structures merging
with solid sheets. The solid component occupies more than 50% of total. Focal squamous
differentiation is identified. Focally tumor cells show very high-grade nuclei and bizarre nuclear
morphology.
Immunohistochemistry staining shows glandular areas show positive staining with ER but weak
focal staining with p53 and negative staining with p16. The solid areas show negative staining
with ER but patchy positive staining with p53 and patchy positive staining with p16. The overall
morphological and immunohistochemistry features of this tumour is consistent with grade 3/3
endometrioid adenocarcinoma of endometrium.

Clinical History:
presents with abnormal appearing uterus at the time of hysterectomy.
Gross Description:
Received are five appropriately labeled containers.
Container A:
Comment :The uterus and bilateral tubes and ovaries are received partially morcellated and markedly disrupted. Therefore ,determining anterior from posterior is impossible .Determining grossly where the lower uterine segment is
located is also not possible .Of note ,only one of the ovaries and fallopian tubes is identified attached to the specimen.
The cervix and endocervical canal are received separately in the container.
Adnexa :One ovary is identified attached to its fallopian tube. A fragmented piece of separately discovered fallopian
tube is also appreciated .The second ovary is not discovered.
Weight :431 grams
Shape :cannot be determined due to morcellation
Dimensions :Because the specimen is morcellated ,the usual dimensions cannot be appreciated. The specimen measures
in aggregate 8.0 x 5 .0 x 5.0 cm.
Serosa :The serosal surface that can be appreciated is pink ,dull and significant for several subserosal candidate
leiomyomata (measuring less than 1.0 cm in maximum dimension).
Cervix :The separately submitted cervix demonstrates a white ectocervix with petechial hemorrhages.
length of endocervical canal: cannot be determined due to morcellations
endocervix: 4.0 cm
Endomyometrium:
length of endometrial cavity: estimated at 4.0 cm
width of endometrial cavity at fundus: 3.5 cm
tumor findings:
dimensions: The serially sectioned tumor that is appreciated measures 4.0 x 3 .0 x 1.0 cm.
appearance :The tumor is white ,soft, friable, and exophytic.
location and extent :The tumor is present in the uterine corpus that is appreciated. As stated ,extension to the lower
uterine segment cannot be appreciated.
myometrial invasion :outer half
thickness of myometrial wall at deepest gross invasion: 3.0 cm
other findings or comments: none
Adnexa: -
Undesignated ovary:
Dimensions :2.0 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm

Justification: The label does not specify if the uterine corpus with attached cervix is from the left or right side of the body.

Histology: Adenocarcinoma
Justification: A fungating tan-brown friable tumor mass was found on the anterior and posterior endometrium, which suggests a malignant neoplasm such as adenocarcinoma.

Stage: Not provided
Justification: The stage of cancer cannot be determined from the gross description alone and would require additional information such as the extent of invasion into surrounding tissues or the presence of metastasis.

Grade: Not provided
Justification: The grade of cancer cannot be determined from the gross description alone and would require microscopic examination of tissue sections to assess the degree of differentiation.

tubes weighing114 grams. The uterus and cervix measure 8 .4 cm from superior to inferior x 5.5 cm from comu to comu x 4.5 cm from anterior to posterior. The cervix Itself measures3.2 x 3.5 x 2.5 cm. The serosal surface of the uterus Is tan-pink to purple and unremarkable. The ectocervix measures 3.0 x 2.8 cm. The cervical os Is silt-like, measuring 0.9 x 0.3 cm. The ectocervix is tan-pink and slightly hemorrhagic. Nabothian cysts are noted at the 8 to 8
o'clock position. The uterus and cervix have been previously opened. The endometrial cavity Is expanded by a tumormass. The endometrlal cavity measures 4.0 x 5.0 cm. The tumormeasures4.2 x 4.1 x 3.3 cm. The tumor Involvesboth the anterior and the posterior endometrium. It Is predominantly on the anterior endometrlum. The tumor is
tan-yellow to gray and polypoid. Seriallysectioning through the tumor reveals another area of significant myometrialinvasion, where the tumor appears to Invade Into the myometrium ate depth of 1.1 cm, where the entire myometrialwall thickness is 1.2 cm. A circumscribednodular massIs located within the myometrium of the anterior, lower, andmid-uterine segment. On cut surface, it has a white-pink, whorledtexture .It measures 1.5 x 0.9 x 1.3 cm. It most resembles a well circumscribedleiomyoma. The portion of myometrium not Involved by tumor measures 1.4 cm in
thickness. The remainder of the endometrium that does not appear to be Involved by tumor measures - 0.2 cm Inthickness. The tumor approaches the lower uterinesegment at the borderbetween the middle and lower uterine segment. It ties 1.7 cm from the endocervical canal. The endocervicalcanal measures 2.2 cm in length x 1.4 cm. Theendocervical mucosa Is tan-pink and contains some endocervlcal cysts. The right ovarymeasures 2.2 x 1.4 x 1.0 cm. The serosal surface Is tan-pink to yellow and unremarkable . The right fallopian tube measures 5.2 cm In length with an average diameterof 0.5 cm.

CLINICAL HISTORY:
Malignant neoplasm corpus uteri.
GROSS EXAMINATION:A. ""Uterus, bilateral tubes and ovaries"", received fresh and placed in
formalin on at pm is a markedly disrupted fragmented uterus with
attached bilateral adnexa, 235 grams overall. The cervix is received in
several fragments as well as several additional separate nodules consistent
with leiomyomata. The uterine corpus is 9.5 x 9.5 x 8.2 cm overall. The
endometrial cavity is remarkable for a tan, fungating, friable tumor mass
which is approximately 3.5 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm. Due to the fragmented appearance
of the uterus, anterior and posterior endometrial walls cannot be cut
ascertained. Sectioning through the tumormassreveals a tan-gray-white
surface. The tumormassis approximately 1.1 cm thick at its thickest
myometrial of up to 2.6 cm. The myometrium is tan, trabeculated, and is
remarkable for numerous leiomyomata, the largest of which is 6.5 cm in
greatest dimension. The cut surfaces of the leiomyomata are white, whorled,
no hemorrhage or necrosis is grossly noted. Additionally received in the same
container are two fragments of tissue compatible with disrupted cervix, the
cervix is 3.5 x 2.5 cm overall, the endocervical canal is unremarkable. Also
received are several well-circumscribed leiomyomata, the largest of which is 4
cm in greatest dimension. The cut surfaces are white, whorled, and no
hemorrhage or necrosis is noted. The presumed left ovary is 2.7 x 1.5 x 0.9
cm. The external surface is tan-yellow and corrugated. The associated
fallopian tube segment is 4.5 cm long x 0.4 an in diameter. One end is
blunted, the opposing end contains tan-pink fimbria. Sectioning of the ovary
discloses a tan-yellow, 1.1 cm cyst. The remaining ovarian parenchyma is
unremarkable. The presumed right ovary is tan-yellow, 1.5 x 1.3 x 1 cm and
displays a cerebriform external surface. The associated fallopian tube
segment is 3.5 cm long x 0.4 cm in diameter. One end is blunted, the opposing
end contains tan-pink, delicate fimbria. The cutsurfaceceeoflthecoovary
severaldiscloses a tan-yellow, homogeneous cut surface, with
thin-walled cysts,the largest of which is 0.2 cm in greatest dimension.

MOLECULAR RESULTS
Endometrial carcinoma, microsatellite instability testing:
Microsatellite-stable tumor (see technical report).
Intact (positive) nuclear expression of MI-H1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 by immunohistochemistry.
TECHNICAL REPORT
DNA extracted from microdissected paraffin-embedded tumor (T) in sections from block B5 and non-neoplastic tissue (N) from
block B16 was analyzed by a PCR-based method followed by capillary electrophoretic detection. A panel of seven microsatellite
markers recommended by the NCI (BAT25, BAT26, BAT40, D2S123, D5S346, D17S250 and TGFBR2) was evaluated to detect
changes in the number of microsatellite repeats in tumor as compared to normal tissue. No allelic shift was detected in the tested
microsatellite markers.
Immunohistochemistry for MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 was performed using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of
the endometrial carcinoma.
""This test was developed and its performance determined byencleared or approved by the U .S. Food and Drug Administration .The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. This test is used fo

F. UTERUS AND CERVIX
Labeled with the patient 's name ,labeled ""uterus and cervix "",and received fresh in the Operating Room for
intraoperative gross consultation and subsequently fixed in formalin and is a 270 gram total hysterectomy specimen.
The uterus is about 10.0 x 9.5 x 8.5 cm in greatest overall dimensions with the cervical portion measuring about 3.5
cm in length and up to 2.5 cm in diameter .The external cervical os is patent and 0.5 cm in diameter. The
endometrial cavity is 6.0 cm long and up to 5.0 cm in width. The muscular uterine wall has a maximum thickness
of about 2.5 cm.
The endometrial cavity is partially replaced by friable pink -tan tumor . The tumor measures about 13.0 x 9.0 cm in
area,involves the uterine fundus, the entire anterior and posterior corpus and the posterior lower uterine segment.
In the latter area the tumor extends very close to the endocervical /lower uterine segment junction .No gross tumor
is seen in the cervix .Cut sections of the uterus reveal invasion of greater than 50% of the uterine wall. Invasive
tumor extends to within about 0.3 cm of the serosal surface of the uterus .No involvement of uterine serosa or
parametrial tissues by tumor is evidence.
There is scant uninvolved endometrial mucosa in the anterior lower uterine corpus and lower uterine segment,
which measures about 0.1 cm in thickness .Within the uterus ,there are seven well-circumscribed leiomyomas,
ranging from about 0.5 to 2.5 cm in maximum dimensions ,three of which are subserosal and the remainder of
which are intramural .One of the intramural leiomyomas is located in the anterior lower uterine corpus and lower
uterine segment .One of the smaller leiomyomas has a semi-firm white rubbery cut surface. The other leiomyomas
have firm solid tan -white whorled cut surfaces .No areas of hemorrhage or necrosis are evident in any of the
leiomyomas .A focus of friable tumor measuring about 0.5 cm in diameter is present in the largest leiomyoma. The
mucosa of the cervix appears partly defective /eroded .Several mucus -filled cysts ,up to about 0.2 cm is diameter are
also noted in the cervix.

PATHOLOGY #:
Part F received fresh labeled 1 and ""uterus ,tubes ,and ovaries ""consists of a uterus with attached cervix and
left and right fallopian tube.
The uterus measures 8 cm superior to inferior ,7 cm laterally ,and 2 .5 cm anterior to posterior and weighs 160
grams .The left anterior serous has a 3 x 2.5 x 0 .3 cm irregular tan yellow irregular ulcerated mass attached to the left round
ligament and a 0.5 x 0 .4 x 0.3 cm nodule 0.8 cm inferior to mass.
The uterus is inked as follows :anterior -green, posterior -yellow, and the cervix is amputated and the uterus is
bisected into anterior and posterior halves revealing an irregular papillary mass primarily within the anterior endometrial
cavity measuring 2 x 2 cm. After inking, the cut sections ofthe mass on the serosal surface are tan-yellow. Cut sections of
the smaller tan nodule are well circumscribed and tan-white The myometrium measures 1.3 cm in maximal thickness and the
tumor is seen to invade to a thickness of 1.3 cm in the anterior endomyometrium. The myometrium in the posterior portion
measures 0.5 cm and the tumor is seen to invade to a thickness of 0.3 cm Cut sections of the remaining tnyometrium are
tan-pink and smooth .No other nodules are seen.
The cervical margin is irregular, disrupted and friable with multiple papillary areas .This area measures 5.5 x
5 cm. The amputated cervix is opened at the 12:00 position and sectioned clockwise and entirely submitted.
The left ovary measures 3 x 2 x 1 cm and weighs 3 grams. Cut sections of the left ovary are tan-pink with a central
tan-yellow area measuring t x 0.8 x 0.2 cm .The left fallopian tube is irregular and thickened and consists mainly of distal
fimbriated end measuring 3.5 x 03 cm.
. The right ovary measures2 x 2 x 0 .3 cm and weighs 2 grams. The right fallopian tube measures 4 x 0.5 cm Cut . .
sections of the right ovary are tan -pink . .
SUMMARY OF SECTIONS: FI and F2.- tumor with anterior endomyometrium; F3 and F4 - tumor with posterior
endomyometrium; F5 through F7 - irregular area on serosal surface; F8 - nodule on serosal surface; F9 - right ovary and
fallopian tube; F10 - left ovary and fallopian tube; F11 - right side of cervix; F12 - left side of cervix. The cervix is entirely
submitted as follows. F13 and F14 -1:00; F15 and F16 - 2:00; F17 - 3:00; F18 - 4:00; F19 - 5:00; F20 - 6:00; F21 and F22

MICROSCOPIC: A poorly differentiated papillary serous adenocarcinoma of the endometrium is seen infiltrating
throughout the myometruun and out onto the serosal surface. There is extensive vascular invasion. The neoplasm is also
seen to involve cervix including endoccrvical glands and cervical stromal invasion. The left ovary and fallopian tube are
also infiltrated by tumor as well as the left and right sides of the cervix. The tumor shows extensive necrosis, poorly formed
glands and extensive single cell infiltration. Lymphovascular space involvement is seen throughout the sections.

SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT
Page 3 of 4"," Site: Uterus, left ovary, left fallopian tube, and cervix
Justification: The report describes a papillary serous adenocarcinoma primary in the endometrium, which has invaded the myometrium, serosal surface, and cervix, as well as the left ovary and fallopian tube.

Laterality: Left
Justification: The tumor is present in the left ovary, left fallopian tube, and left iliac and obturator lymph nodes.

Histology: Papillary serous adenocarcinoma
Justification: This is stated explicitly in the report as the diagnosed tumor type.

Stage: Not provided
Justification: The report does not provide enough information to determine the stage of the cancer, such as whether there is evidence of metastasis beyond the pelvis.

Grade: FIGO grade 3
Justification: The report describes the tumor as poorly differentiated and having extensive necrosis, which are features consistent with a high-grade tumor.

Behavior: Malignant
Justification: This is indicated by the diagnosis of papillary serous adenocarcinoma, which is an aggressive type of cancer that can invade surrounding tissues and metastasize to distant sites.",Papillary serous adenocarcinoma,,FIGO grade 3,Malignant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Comments
Histologic sections from the endometrial neoplasm demonstrate a
tumor comprised of large epithelial cells with marked pleomorphism
and prominent nuclear atypia. In areas there is glanular and
pseudo-glandular growth as noted ;however ,much of the neoplasm is
composed of sheet-like growth of these neoplastic cells with no
discernible glandular formation .The overall histologic
characteristics are those of a poorly differentiated (grade 3)
endometrial adenocarcinoma. Clinical correlation is recommended. At the request of the undersigned pathologist ,these slides have
been additionally reviewed by Dr .- who concurs with the
diagnosis.

consultation and subsequently fixed in formalin is an 84 gram total
hysterectomy specimen. The uterus measures about 7.4 cm from the
fundus to the ectocervix, 3.8 cm from cornu to cornu, and up to 4.1
cm from the anterior surface to the posterior surface. The uterine
serosa is tan-red, and generally smooth except for procedure-related
artifact. Attached to the uterus, there is a small amount of pink-
tan firm parametrial soft tissue. The parametrial soft tissues,
bilaterally, appears grossly free of tumor. The cervix is about 2.8
cm long and has a maximum diameter of 1.9 cm in the ectocervical
region. The mucosa lining the ectocervix is tan and smooth. The
external cervical os is patent and about 0.9 cm in diameter. The
uterus was previously incised on both sides at the time of the
intraoperative consult. The cervical transformation zone is
distinct. The endocervical canal is about 2.1 cm long and lined forPage 2 of 6 Page 3 of 6
(coythe most part by slightly rugose tan mucosa. In the posterior
endocervix, there are two tiny endocervical polyps, measuring about
0.2 and 0.3 cm in maximum dimension, each is composed of semi-soft
tan-white tissue. Cut sections of the cervix reveal multiple mucus-
filled cysts ranging from about 0.1 to 0.3 cm in diameter. The
cervix appears grossly free of tumor. The endometrial cavity is
about 5.0 cm long and up to 3.0 cm in diameter. The endometrial
cavity is largely occupied by an exophytic polypoid pale tan tumor
mass that has a friable and focally papillated surface. The tumor
mass measures about 4.2 x 3.0 cm in surface area and has a maximum
thickness of about 1.6 cm, including exophytic and endophytic
components. extensively involves the uterine fundus, anterior
uterine corpus, posterior uterine corpus, and extends into the
posterior lower uterine segment. Upon sectioning the uterus,
invasive carcinoma is seen involving the fundus, posterior uterine
corpus and anterior uterine corpus. In the posterior fundus
and posterior corpus, greater than 50% of the wall thickness is
involved by tumor. Tumor in the anterior uterus and in the posterior
lower uterine segment is more superficially invasive (involves less
than 50% of the wall thickness). Within the uterus, mostly in the
lower anterior corpus and lower uterine segment, there is a small
amount of uninvolved tan endometrium that has a maximum thickness of
less than 0.1 cm. Within the uterus, there are five sharply
circumscribed intramural leiomyomas that measure about 0.3, 0.5,
0.6, 1.2 and 1.5 cm in maximum dimensions. The smallest and second
smallest leiomyomas are in the fundus. The third smallest
leiomyoma is located in the anterior lower uterine segment. The
largest and second largest leiomyomas are located in the posterior
uterine corpus. The largest and second largest leiomyomas have firm
white cut surfaces without grossly evident areas of hemorrhage
or necrosis. The second largest leiomyoma is partially calcified.
The smallest and second smallest leiomyomas have firm tan-white
whorled cut surfaces without grossly evident areas of hemorrhage or
necrosis. The uninvolved myometrium is semi-firm, tan-pink, up
to 1.8 cm in thickness and shows trabeculations and focal minute
cystic spaces suggestive of adenomyosis.

Gross Descrogt oon:A.Received fresh labeled with the patient's name and ""uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries"" is a 154 gram hysterectomy
specimen, measuring 10.5 x 6.2 x 4.2 cm. The specimen is opened to reveal a 4.5 x 3.2 cm fungating mass located
predominantly in the posterior endometrium. Within the anterior and posterior myometrium is a 5.2 x 5.1 x 5.0 cm circumscribed
tan-white whorled nodule, grossly consistent with a leiomyoma. This leiomyoma is compressing up against and displacing the

A. ""Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries (AF1)"", received fresh for
frozen section is a 126 gram, 8.2 x 6.5 x 3.1 cm uterus with attached
bilateral adnexa. The deep soft tissue is inked blue. The serosa is
tan-gray, smooth and glistening. The uterus is bivalved to reveal a 3.1 x 2.6
x 1.1 cm tan, sessile, firm mass with a friable surface overlying the
endometrium at the fundus and extending into anterior and posterior
endometrial cavities. The mass grossly appears to invade 0.2 cm into a 1.2 cmthick myometrium.The mass doesnot extend to the cervix (2.6 cm at closest
approach from the posterior half). The uninvolved endometrium is otherwise
tan, smooth and with multiple less than 0.1 cm cysts. The 0.1 cm thick
endometriam overlies a 1 cm in average thickness unremarkable myometrium. The
cervix (2.9 cm in diameter with a 1.1 cm patent os) has an unremarkable ecto
and endocervical mucosa. A representative of the mass is frozen as AF1. The

Gross Description
A. Received in formalin labeled - uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries"" is a previously opened uterus and cervix
with attached right and left fallopian tubes and ovaries, 336.0 grams. The uterus is symmetrical in configuration, 11.0 cm in
length, 7.5 cm in broadest extent, and up to 5.5 cm anterior-posteriorly. The serosa is pink-tan, smooth and glistening. The
cervix with attached vaginal cuff is 4.0 x 4.0 x 4.0 cm, and appears grossly normal. A portion of the cervix has been removed
intraoperatively and submitted for cancer research. Cross sectioningreveals a thin pink, slightly hemorrhagic endometrium,
0.1 cm in greatest thickness. A portion of the endometrium has been removed intraoperatively and submitted for cancer
research. Situated along the posterior aspect of the endometrial canal is a friable, red-tan polypoid lesion, 3.5 x 3.5 cm
across. The cut surface of the tumor reveals it to be grossly confined to the endometrium. At this level, the myometrium is at
least 2.5 cm in thickness. There is an area of circumscribed nodularity in the uterine wall, grossly consistent with a lelomyoma
of 1.0 cm. The right and left fallopian tubes are unremarkable. The right and left ovaries are each approximately 2.0 x 1.5 x
1.0 cm, and appear grossly normal. A portion of each ovary has been removed intraoperatively and submitted for cancer
research. Representative sections, blocks Al-A13.

Laterality: The laterality is specified for the lymph nodes and fallopian tubes, but not for the omentum or the uterus with cervix and ovaries.

Histology: Not all specimens have been examined histologically, but based on the description of the largest mass in the uterus, it is likely to be a malignant neoplasm.

Stage: The stage cannot be determined without additional information about the extent of disease beyond what is described in this report.

Grade: The grade cannot be determined without histological examination and correlation with established grading criteria for the type of tumor present.

Behavior: Based on the size and depth of invasion of the mass in the uterus, it is likely to be a malignant neoplasm with potential for aggressive behavior. However, a definitive assessment cannot be made without histological examination and clinical correlation.","not all specimens have been examined histologically, but likely to be a malignant neoplasm in the uterus",cannot be determined,cannot be determined,"likely to be a malignant neoplasm with potential for aggressive behavior in the uterus, but cannot be definitively assessed without histological examination and clinical correlation",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Justification: The report describes an endometrioid adenocarcinoma in the uterus with superficial muscle invasion and a separate invasive carcinoma in the cervix. The stage is not provided, but based on the description of the tumor involving less than 50% of the muscular wall thickness in the superior aspect of the specimen, it may be an early-stage cancer. The grade for the endometrial adenocarcinoma is given as I-II/III, indicating a well to moderately differentiated tumor. The grade for the cervical carcinoma is not provided.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
1) Received in fixative, labeled with the patient' s name and unit number and ""uterus,
cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries"", is a 232 gram specimen including a previously
opened uterus (10.5 x 7.2 x 5.5 cm), left fallopian tube (5.' cm in length, 04-0.6 cm
in diameter), left ovary (2.5 x 2.2 x 1.1 cm), right fallopian tube (6.2 cm in length,
0.5-0.7 cm in diameter ), right ovary (3.1 x 2.2 x 1.4 cm). The external surface of
the uterus is dull and covered by multiple fine adhesions. There is an area (1.5 x
1.0 cm) in the lower pole of the left ovary which is ragged and probably represents a
resection margin (inked black). There is no visible gross lesion on the external
surface of the specimen . The cervix measures 2.2 x 2.0 cm and is covered by red-tan
slightly hemorrhagic smooth mucosa. The external os is slit-like and measures 0.4 x
0.2 cm. The endocervical canal is 2.7 cm in length and has pink-tan herringbone
mucosa . The endometrial cavity measures 5.5 cm in length x 3.7 cm from cornu to
cornu. There is anextensive exophytic papillary growth involving almost the entire
endometrium sparing only the lower uterine segment, 0.3 cm on the anterior surface and
1.1 cm from the posterior surface. The uninvolved endometrium has pink-tan appearance
and measures 0.2 to 0.4 cm in thickness. The tumor mass is white-tan, fragile and
papillary. The tumor measures 6.2 cm (combined on anterior and posterior surface) x
5.2 cm x 1.4 cm (maximum thickness). The central portion of the tumor is necrotic.
Grossly, the tumor invades myometrium with the maximum extent of the anterior uterine
wall, 1. 4 cm of muscle invasion with 2.8 cm wall thickness. There is a partially
calcified leiomyoma (4.5 cm in diameter) located within the myometrium of the
posterior wall with a focal area of hemorrhage. Both fallopian tubes have previously
removed central portions, consistent with a history of bilateral tubal ligation.
There is a paratubal cyst (0.4 cm in diameter) with smooth internal lining and filled
with yellow fluid, which is located in the distal portion of the right fallopian tube.
Otherwise, the fallopian tubes are unremarkable. The left ovary is composed of
sclerotic white-yellow tissue with multiple corpora albicantia. The right ovary has
smooth and glistening pink-tan surface with white-yellow sclerotic parenchyma and
multiple corpora albicantia. The specimen is serially sectioned and submitted as
follows:

forrnalin-filled specimen is markedly distorted but when examined fresh measured 15.0 x 13.0 x 11.0 cm. The serosal
surface is smooth. The cervix measures 2.1 x 2.0 cm. The ectocervix has a tan-brown, glistening mu.cdsa with nogross lesions seen ,The endocerrical canal has a tan appearance and measures 2.7 cm in length. The endometriel
cavity is difficult to measure secondary to marked distortion, but appears to. measure at least 9.0 'cm from
comu-to-comu by 6.5 cm in length. The ertdometrial cavity is filled by the previously described large polypoid mass
measuring 14.0 x 12.5 x 10.0 cm, The mass is multilobulated and muibcystic with abundant areas of green-tannecrosis and friable tan, solid areas .The mass appears to. originate :from the fundus and the superior aspect of the
anterior endometrium involving.the anterior myometrium. The remainder of the endometrial mucosa has arough,nodular appearance. The myometrium is thinned in multiple areas and has multiple nodules present within the anterioraspect which appear to be contiguous with the lesion. The largest of these nodules measure 3.0 cm in greatest
dimension. The nodules extend to within 0.3 cm. of the serosal surface which is smooth and glistening. The
myometrium measures up to 12 cm in greatest thickness. Multiple additional firm nodules are present in the posterioraspect of the myometriurn. These nodules have a well-circumscribed firm, tan-white, whorled appearance. The
largest of these nodules measure 0.6 cm in greatest dimension. The anterior myometrium is also involved by multiple
firm well-circumscribed, tan-white, whorled-appearing nodules with abundant calcification. The nodules measure up to
2.5 cm in greatest dimension. The right fallopian tube and ovary are still attached to the uterus. The right fallopian
tube measures 6.5 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm and has a fimbriated end. The tube is sectionedto show a pinpoint lumen with no
additional lesions seen .The right ovary is strophic and measures 1.6 x 0.8.x 0.6 cm. The serosal surface is tan-whiteand smooth The ovary is bisected to show a tan-white mottled parenchyma with no lesions seen .The left fallopiantube and ovary are detached and present in the container.

watery fluid .Two cytospins are obtained.
B. The specimen is received fresh in a single container, labeled with the patient's name and number, and
marked as ""uterus ,cervix, tubes and ovaries .""It consists of a hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-
oophorectomy specimen weighing .62 grams .The uterus measures 6.8 x 5 x 2.5 cm and is in continuity
with the right 2 .5 x 1.5 x 1 cm, and left, 3 x 1.3 x 1 cm ovaries ,and the fimbriated right and left fallopian
tubes, each 8 x 0.5 cm.
The entire anterior endometrial cavity is filled with a 3 x 2 cm tumor. The tumor is friable and protrudes
up to 1.6 cm above the flat.endornetrial surface. Detached aggregates of tumor are found within the
endocervical canal. Further,, there is no grossly apparent extension into mucosa or underlying
endocervical stroma. There is suggestion of minimal superficial invasion into underlying myometriurn
which measures 1.1 cm in thickness. The adnexa are grossly free of tumor. Solid fibrous nodules
measuring-up to 0.8 cm in largest diameter are found growing on both ovarian surfaces. Paratubal
cysts are present bilaterally.

Procedures/Addenda:
Addendum
Addendum
The following addendum is issued to report the results of
estrogen and progesterone receptor and p63 immunohistochemical
studies.
Results:
Estrogen receptor (Ventana, clone SP1):
Interpretation: Approximately 60-700 of tumor cells show
moderate (2+/3) nuclear immunoreactivity.
Progesterone receptor (Ventana, clone 1E2):
Interpretation: Approximately 5% of tumor cells show moderate
(2+/3) nuclear immunoreactivity.
p63: Tumor is negative (with a postive control slide).
Site: Endometrium
Performed on block: E10
Fixation: 10% neutral buffered formalin
Fixation time: Not specified.
Comment:
The lack of p63 staining in the confluent areas of tumor growth
supports interpretation as adenocarcinoma with extensive solid
pattern growth and supports classification as grade 3
endometrioid adenocarcinoma."," Site: Endometrium
Justification: The specimen is labeled as endometrial cancer and multiple blocks are taken from different parts of the endometrium.

Laterality: Not provided
Justification: The clinical history mentions that the patient has endometrial cancer but it does not specify if it is unilateral or bilateral.

Histology: Endometrioid adenocarcinoma
Justification: The immunohistochemical studies show that the tumor is negative for p63, which supports this classification.

Stage: Not provided
Justification: The information given does not include details about the extent of the cancer or if it has spread to other parts of the body.

Grade: Grade 3
Justification: The immunohistochemical studies show that the tumor is negative for p63, which supports this classification as grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma.

Behavior: Malignant
Justification: The patient was diagnosed with endometrial cancer and it is not specified if it has been completely removed or treated.",Endometrioid adenocarcinoma,,Grade 3,Malignant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A. ""Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries (AF1-2)"". Received fresh is a
99 gram uterus (9 x 6 x 3 cm ) with attached left ovary (1.9 x 1.8 x 0.8 cm),
left fimbriated fallopian tube (3.6 cm long x 0.4 cm in diameter, right ovary
(2.6 x 1.5 x 1.2 cm) and right fimbriated fallopian tube (3.2 cm long x 0.5 cm
in diameter). The endometrial cavity is 2.7 cm from cornu to cornu and
expands 4.8 cm and contains an ill-defined fundal soft gray-tan endometrialmass(1.3 x 1 x 0.7 cm) that slightly traces into the anterior and posterior
endometrium, 4.5 cm and 3.1 cm from the anterior and posterior lower uterinesegmentsrespectively. The mass penetrates 0.2 cm into a 1.5 cm thick
trabeculated myometrium that contains a single white whorled intramural nodule(1 x 1 x 0.9 cm).The mass waspartially frozen as representative AF1. Theremainder of the endometrium is red-tan and diffuselycoarse (0.1 cm thick)with a second soft gray-tan mass (1.6 x 1.3 x 0.2 cm) that is 1.1 cm from the
lower uterine segment. Thesecond massextends 0.2 cm into the underlyingmyometrium. The uterineserosa ispink-tan, smooth and glistening. The
exocervix is red-white and smooth with diffuse erythema surrounding a 1 cm
cervical-os-that- leads--into- a-2.-5--cm`trahecu7.afed endocervical canal. The
left and right ovary are grossly unremarkable. The left and right fimbriated
fallopian tubes are both discontinuous and grossly unremarkable.

CLINICAL HISTORY:
Malignant neoplasm corpus uteri. Grade 1 endometrial cancer per endometrial
biopsy.
GROSS EXAMINATION:
A. ""Uterus, cervix, tubes, ovaries and fibroid (AF1-4)"", received fresh and
placed in formalin at is a 303 gram, 13 x 10 x 4.5 cm
didelphic uterus with attached bilateral tubes and ovaries (bilateral ovaries-
2.5 x 1.7 x 1.4 cm, bilateral fimbriated fallopian tube- 6 cm long x 0.6 cm in
diameter). The 3 cm in diameter cervix has one 1.5 cm in diameter patent os
which leads into a septated endocervical canal, dividing the endocervical
canal and endometrial cavities into right and left separate structures. The 7
x 4 cm left endometrial cavity is 100% effaced and replaced by white-tan,
exophytic, soft and triable endometrial tumor (present on both anterior and
posterior endometrium), which grossly invades 1.5 cm into and up to 3.5 cm
thick myometrium. The tumor also extends to involve the left anterior and
posterior lower uterine segment, 3.8 and 2.9 cm from the external os,
respectively. The 7 x 1.4 cm right endometrial cavity is compressed and
distorted by the aforementioned tumor in the left endometrial cavity as well
as by a large intramural nodule underlying the left endometrial cavity. The
right endometrium is 0.1 cm thick and contains two small, superficial tan
polyps, each 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.7 cm. These polyps are within the posterior right
endometrium.
There are three total myometrial nodules ranging from 1.5 cm in greatest
dimension -4 x 3.5 x 3 cm . All three nodules are intramural without
hemorrhage or necrosis , with the two smallest within the anterior, right
myometrium and the largest within the posterior, left myometrium.
The bilateral ovaries are pink-yellow with a 0.4 cm in diameter simple
cortical cyst within the left ovary with smooth inner walls. The bilateral
fallopian tubes are also unremarkable.
Also received is a separate 92 gram (fixed weight), 7.6 x 5.5 x 5.4 cm
white-tan, smooth nodule which on sectioning is focally calcified with an
otherwise whorled cut surface without hemorrhage or necrosis.

Tumor however, is not identified on the serosal surface. Metastases are noted
in the right ovary, periappendiceal fat (at the tip), and within the mesenteric
fat of the small bowel. The metastases seen in the small bowel mesentery and
ovary show somewhat divergent (higher grade) histology than the primary
endometrioid adenocarcinoma. The pattern of infiltration as well as the
cytology raised the possibility of a synchronous neuroendocrine carcinoma. As a
result, immunohistochemical stains for cytokeratin 7, cytokeratin 20,
chromogranin, and synaptophysin were performed on both the endometrium and
ovarian tumor (B3 and B 13). The staining profiles are identical and consistent
with a metastatic endometrioid adenocarcinoma. Neuroendocrine differentiation
is not seen by immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemistry for estrogen and
progesterone has been performed on (B3) and (B 13) and will be reported
separately. has been called with the results on

Received in normal saline labeled , and ""uterus ,cervix,tubes ,ovaries ""is a 395 gram uterus including cervix and bilateral attached
adnexa. The uterus measures 9.2 cm from cervix to fundus ,4.5 cm from cornu tocornu ,and 3.2 cm from anterior to posterior .The serosal surface of the uterusis smooth ,shiny, and unremarkable without grossly apparent nodules or masses.
The right ovary is entirely replaced by a tan-yellow ,partially necrotic and
hemorrhagic mass that measures 8.5 x 6.5 x 5.5 cm. The mass appears to grossly
obliterate the fallopian tube. However ,there is a focal ,1.5 x 1.3 x 1.0 cm
portion of what appears to be fimbriated end adherent to the mass .In addition,immediately adjacent to the right cornu is a 3 .5 cm in length by 1.0 cm indiameter ,distended and dilated tubular structure with a smooth ,shiny serosalsurface that may represent residual fallopian tube .The left ovary (2.0 x 1.2 x
0.6 cm) is smooth and shiny and has a cerebriform surface within grossly evident
nodules or masses .Sectioning this ovary reveals a white to yellow, homogenous
cut surface ,again without masses. The left fallopian tube measures 5.0 cm in
length by 0 .6 cm in diameter and has a smooth ,shiny ,unremarkable serosawithout grossly apparent nodules or masses .There is a 0.2 cm ,white, shiny
paratubal cyst identified adjacent to the fimbriated end. Bivalving the uterus
into anterior and posterior halves reveals a thin, somewhat atrophic endometrium
with abundant overlying hemorrhage .The endometrium measures approximately 0.1
cm in greatest thickness and contains no grossly apparent nodules or masses.
The myometrium is light tan ,trabeculated, and contains two white, whorled
nodules measuring 0.7 cm in greatest diameter and 2.0 cm in greatest diameter.
The myometrium measures 1.8 cm in greatest thickness. The right ovarian mass,
while adherent to the right cornu of the uterus, does not grossly invade into
the uterus and does not involve the serosa .A representative section of the

Upon clinician, this case was reviewed and additional immunohistochemical staining was performed on blocks 81, B2 and 07.
The fallopian tube shows focal positivity for p53 and MIBI. with features consistent with serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma. There are also foci positive
for p53 and MIBI on the ovarian surface (block 82). These areas have features consistent with tubal intraepithelial carcinoma, as apposed to p53
signature or a tubal in transition lesion. The endometrial cancer, as shown in block 07, is strongly positive for p53 and negative for WT-1, consistent with
a serous carcinoma, high-grade of endometrial origin.
I would recommend the patient be treated according to these findings.

Behavior: Malignant (Endometrial carcinoma is a malignancy that can invade surrounding tissues and spread to other organs)

The information provided in the description suggests a diagnosis of endometrial carcinoma based on the presence of pink-tan granular tumor involving primarily the anterior wall of the endometrium. However, additional information such as lymph node involvement, spread to adjacent organs, or distant metastasis is required for staging, and assessment of glandular differentiation, nuclear atypia, and mitotic activity is necessary for grading.",Endometrial carcinoma with glistening pink-tan granular tumor in the endometrium,,,Malignant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Microscopic Description
A-G. The microscopic findings support the above diagnoses.
A"," Site: Uterus
Laterality: Not provided (as it's a report on multiple specimens)
Histology: Adenocarcinoma, endometrioid type
Stage: T2b, NX (based on the information provided, the N category is not clear)
Grade: Not provided
Behavior: Malignant (due to the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma)

Justification: The report mentions a ""diffuse spreading mass lesion that covers the entire endometrial surface"" and ""the tumor extends inferiorly to involve the endocervical canal,"" which are indicative of malignant adenocarcinoma. The T category is determined based on the size of the tumor, and NX is used when lymph node involvement is not assessed or not reported.","Adenocarcinoma, endometrioid type","T2b, NX",,Malignant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PRE-OP DIAGNOSIS: Uterine carcinoma.
GROSS DESCRIPTION
A. Part A received fresh, labeled ""uterus, cervix,
bilateral tubes and ovaries"", is a 100 gram, 5.5 x 5.5 x
4.0 cm. symmetrical uterine corpus with attached 1.4 cm. of lower
uterine segment and bilateral adnexa. The cervical tissue is not
present. The 5.0 x 3.9 cm. uterine cavity contains abundant soft
tan white-red tumor, both anteriorly and posteriorly. A scant
amount of uninvolved endometrium is present posteriorly, which
appears smooth tan pink and averages 0.15 cm. in thickness.
Anteriorly, the tumor spans an area of 5.4 x 4.2 cm. and
posteriorly, the tumor spans an area of 4.2 x 3.8 cm. On
sectioning, the tumor has a maximal thickness of 1.8 cm., grossly
involving up to 50% of the myometrium. The myometrium is tan pink
and measures up to 1.8 cm. in thickness, with a single, posterior
1.4 cm. well circumscribed rubbery whorled tan white intramural
leiomyoma. The right ovary is cystic and focally disrupted,
measuring 6.0 x 4.0 x 0.3 cm. The cyst is vacant with a smooth tan
white inner lining. The left ovary is cerebriform, pale tan gold
and measures 1.6 x 1.1 x 0.9 cm. On sectioning, the stroma is pale
tan with identifiable corpora albicantia. Bilaterally, the
fimbriated tan pink right and left fallopian tube segments average

- Metastatic serous adenocarcinoma involving 2 lymph nodes (2/2). Size of largest metastasis up to 2.5 cm, with
extracapsular extension. Comment:
Histologic sections of the above specimens show extensive involvement by serous adenocarcinoma of primary uterine
corpus origin. A uterine corpus primary is supported by involvement of the uterine corpus with transmural myometrial
invasion to the serosa with extensive lymphovascular space invasion. The involvement of the ovaries is multinodular
with preserved intervening areas of ovarian tissue ,also supporting metastases to the ovaries. Additionally,
representative sections from the endometrial tumor and the left ovarian tumor were evaluated by
immunohistochemistry. The tumor at both sites is diffusely positive for P53 and negative for WT-1, results that support
serous adenocarcinoma of primary uterine rather than ovarian origin.

CLINICAL HISTORY:
55 year old woman with a stage I endometrial carcinoma.
GROSS EXAMINATION:
A..-""Uterus"". A uterus measuring 9.5 x 4.0 cm and bilateral 2 cm fragments of
fallopian tubes. The uterus is grossly distorted by multiple leiomyoma
ranging from 1 to 3 cm in diameter. The uterus is opened anteriorly in the
midline revealing an exophytic mass measuring 5 x 3 x 1 cm with numerous
papillary projections into the endometrial cavity, involving anterior and
posterior endometrium and extending very close if not into the upper portion
of the endocervical canal. The endocervical canal measures 3 cm in length.
The myometrium is 1.5 cm thick. Grossly, the endometrial tumor appears to
involve the superficial.myometrium. The resection margin is inked in black
and multiple representative sections are taken.
BLOCK SUMMARY:
Al remnants of Afl, consisting of a.2 x 1 x 0.3 cm soft tan tissue and
multiple 2-3 mm fragments.

B. ""Left tube and ovary"". A 5 cm segment of fallopian tube, an ovary
measuring 3 x 1.5-x 0.1 cm, and a cyst measuring 2â€¢x1.5 x 1 cm that is
attached to the inferior portion of the ovary. The fallopian tube is 0.5 cm
in diameter and appears unremarkable. The ovary is yellow-tan with lobulated
surface. No focal lesions are present. The cyst attached to the ovary is
unilocular, contains a small amount of serous fluid. The wall is thin and
translucent.
BLOCK SUMMARY:
B1 remnant of Bfl consisting of two 5 mm fragment of irregular dark red
tissue. Submitted in toto.
B2 representative section of'the ovary and fallopian tube.

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:
Sections of the uterus show a neoplasm composed of irregular glands in a
cribriform pattern, with a prominent desmoplastic stromal reaction.The tumorfor the most part is limited to the endometrium, with only a few foci which
are suspicious for very superficial myometrial invasion (1 mm or less).

fibroconnective tissue biopsy. The specimen is trisected and entirely submitted in
cassette B1.
C.Received fresh for tissue banking is a 50 gram, 5.0 x 4.8 x 3.6 cm uterine corpus which
has a separately received, disrupted 11 gram, 2.8 x 2.5 x 2.5 cm cervix. The cervix has an
eccentric 0.4 cm os. The uterus is received with the attached bilateral fallopian tubes
and ovaries and weighed with the tubes and ovaries removed. The cervix cannot be oriented
anterior to posterior, and the ectocervical rim will be inked blue with the deeper tissues
inked black. The uterine serosa has focal hemorrhagic adhesions and subserosal nodularity.
The uterus is bivalved to have a diffusely ragged, friable endometrium. The friable.
ragged endometrium appears to fill the entire cavity and is cauterized near the roughened
removed area of the previously amputated cervix. The ragged tumor-like area is 4.5 x 4 0
cm.Sectioning the myometrium shows a 1.8 cm possibly posterior, calcified leiomyoma
within the myometrium. The myometrium ranges up to 2.2 cm in this region, and there
appears to he possible invasive tumor extending 1 6 cm. The tumor is sampled for tissue
banking at The tumor grossly appears to involve more than 50% of the
myometrium posteriorly. and the myometrium is disrupted and hemorrhagic on the anterior
surface. The anterior myometrium averages 0.8 cm in thickness. The tumor appears to
extend with 0.2 cm between the tumor and inked serosa. The tumor diffusely extends more
than 50% of the myometrium both anterior and posterior The right fallopian tube is
disrupted and is 1.7 x 0.4 cm. The fimbria cannot be clearly identified. The right
ovary is 2.5 x 2.0 x 1.2 cm. The ovary is sectioned to have a dense fibrous stroma with
multiple corpora albicantia. The left fallopian tube is a 1.5 cm ill-defined hemorrhagic
segment of fallopian tube which is adhesed to a 2.5 x 1.2 x 1.2 cm ovary. The ovary is
sectioned to have a dense fibrous stroma with multiple corpora albicantia. Representative
sections are sampled as labeled:
C1-C3 -representative sections of cervix to include full cross section to
amputation site
C4 -one full thickness cross section of posterior lower uterine segment,
endometrium to serosa and a section of posterior fundic serosa with
subserosa nodules
C5-C7 -additional posterior full thickness cross section of endometrial tumor
to inked serosa
C8-C11 -anterior full thickness cross sections of endometrium, myometrium and
inked serosa with tumor
C12-C13 -right ovary and possible tube sampled
C14-C15 -left ovary and possible tube sampled

D.Received in formalin labeled ""posterior cul-de-sac"" are two hemorrhagic fibroconnective
tissue biopsies. The biopsies are 0.6 and 1.4 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm. The larger biopsy is
bisected, and the tissues are entirely submitted in cassette D1.
E.Received in formalin labeled ""pericolic gutter"" is a 1.4 x 0.7 x 0 4 cm nodular
fibroconnective tissue biopsy. The biopsy is bisected and entirely submitted in cassette

cervix, 6.0 cm from cornu to cornu. 9.0 cm from anterior to posterior), rightfallopian tube(5.0 cm in length x 0.5 cm in diameter), rightovary (1.7 x 1.2 x 0.4cm), left fallopian tube (4.0 cm in length x 0.5 cm in diameter), and left ovary (2.0
x 1.4 x 0.5 cm). The serosal surface of the uterus is pink to tan. smooth and
glistening. The fsctocervix (1,5 x 1.5 cm) covered with pink to tan mucosa. The
external :.^ is 1.2 x 0.2 cm, The endocervical canal is 3.5 cm in length with aherringbone appearance
, There is a 6.0 x 3.5 x 1.4 cm pink to tan friable mass on the
anterior wall of the uterus. The cut surface shows tumor invading into the inner half
of the myometrium. There is a 5.5 x 5.0 x 4.5 cm intramural fibroid in the posterior
wall of the uterus. The cut surface of the fibroid is white to tan with whorledappearance
. The tumor mass and fibroid distort the uterine cavity and the size of the
uterine cavity is unable to be determined. The endometrium overlying the fibroid
appears thin but is focally thickened to 0.2 cm. The myometrium is approximately 1.5
cn in thickness. The cut surface of the bilateral fallopian tubes is pink to tan and
unremarkable. The cervix and ectocervical margin appear uninva?ved by tumor. The
cut surface of the bilateral ovaries is pink to yellow and unremarkable. Two

Addendum Comment
Section, designated B4, of the left obturator lymph node shows a nodular
architecture with several follicles some of which have small germinal
centers. Occasional follicles composed predominantly or entirely of small
lymphocytes some of which have a monocytoid appearance. Scattered, rare
plasma cells are noted. Areas of fatty infiltration are also identified.
Increased numbers of histiocytes are seen in the dilated sinuses. An
immunohistochemical panel was performed to further characterize the
lymphocytes with respect to architecture. B and T cells (CD20 and CD3
positive, respectively) show appropriate zonation. The T cells are also
positive for CD5 and CD43. No co-expression of CD20 and CD43 or CD5 is
appreciated. The small germinal centers are positive for CD20, CD 10 and
bcl-6, but negative for bcl-2. Some of the small follicles are positive for
CD20 and bcl-2, but negative for CD 10 and bcl-6, these follicles most likely
represent either mantle/marginal zone hyperplasia or primary follicles. CD21
and CD23 stains highlight the follicular dendritic meshwork in the
follicles. Cyclin D 1 is positive in the endothelial cells, but negative in
the lymphocytes.
The combined morphologic and immunophenotypic features in this lymph node
are most consistent with a reactive process. Clinical correlation and
follow-up is recommended.

Hematopathology, have been consulted on this case and concur with the
findings and interpretation.

Comment
The tumor is predominantly composed of endometrioid adenocarcinoma with foci
of serous carcinoma. These foci are present at the lower uterine segment/
upper endocervical canal junction, and consititute the area of deepest
invasion. ER immunostain is strongly positive in the endometrioid areas,
while there is patchy staining in areas of serous carcinoma. P53 shows
strong and diffuse staining in endometrioid areas while it is negative in
areas of serous carcinoma.
Due to abnormal morphology of the lymph nodes, additional
immunohistochemical stains and hematopathology consult is pending, and the
results will be reported in an addendum.

The case is received in ten parts, each labeled with the patient's name, medical record number
and given accession number
, and it is accompanied by a requisition form labeled with the same
name and accession number.
Part A: Received in formalin and labeled ""UTERUS, CERVIX, BILATERAL TUBES
AND OVARIES "" is a 60 gram (5.5 x 4.7 x 2.5 cm) unopened uterus with attached
right fallopian tube (6 x 0.3 cm ), right ovary (2.3 x 2 x 1.4 cm), left fallopian tube (6.9 x 0.4 cm), and left ovary (2.6 x 1.5 x 1.2 cm).
The exocervix (3 x 2.5 cm) is covered by a tan-white, rubbery, and smooth
mucosal surface, and has a 0.5 x 0.5 cm circular os. The uterine serosa is
tan-pink, smooth and glistening. A. The specimen is bivalved to reveal a 2.3
x 1.2 cm endometrial cavity. The anterior endometrium features a 2.1 x 1.1 x
0.6 cm red, friable, exophytic mass extending upward from the endometrium.
The uninvolved endometrium measures 0.2 cm in thickness on average. The
myometrium averages 1.2 cm in thickness. The tumor mass appears
superficial, and grossly does not invade the myometrium.
The right fallopian tube has a pinpoint lumen on cut surface. The right
ovary is tan-white, lobulated, and firm, and is serially sectioned to reveal
unremarkable tan-white parenchyma, with multiple corpora albicantia. The
left fallopian tube is sectioned to reveal a stellate lumen, and the left
ovary is is tan-white, lobulated, and firm, and is serially sectioned to
reveal unremarkable tan-white parenchyma with multiple corpora albicantia.

GROSS EXAMINATION:
A. ""Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries (AF1)"", received fresh for)n is a 293 gram,
frozen section and placed in formalin at
13.5 x 8.5 x 5.5 cm total hysterectomy specimen with an attached 3.2 cm in
diameter cervix with a 0.6 cm patent os. The specimen is opened to reveal a
3.6 x 5.2 x 2.1 cm tan-white, soft, friable, fungating mass lesion located at
the uterine fundus. This mass lesion is located 3.2 cm to the anterior lower
uterine segment, and 2.8 cm to the closest posterior lower uterine segment.
(A4- anterior lower uterine segment, A5- posterior lower uterine segment). The
mass lesion is sectioned to reveal an apparent 0.8 cm invasion into to a 2.1
cm thick trabeculated myometrium. A section with the apparent deepest
invasion at the fundus is frozen as AF1 with the frozen section remnant
submitted in block Al. Sections of the anterior endomyometrium and posterior
endomyometrium with the aforementioned mass lesion are submitted in blocks
A6-7 respectively. The mass lesions comes to 1.5 cm to the closest serosal
surface. An additional representative section of the mass lesion is submitted
in block AS.
The remainder of the specimen demonstrates an endometrium of 0.1 cm overlying
a 2.1 cm trabeculated myometrium in the uninvolved uterus, within an
endometrial cavity of 6 x 5.1 cm. The uterus uninvolved by the aforementioned
mass lesion is remarkable for a 1.1 x 0.9 cm polypoid lesion in the posterior
lower uterine segment. The polypoid lesion is submitted in block A9. Also in
the posterior uterus are two white, whorled nodules, up to 1.8 cm in greatest
dimension. The smaller white, whorled nodule is submitted in block A7 with
the posterior endomyometrium. The larger white, whorled nodule submitted in
block A10. The cervix is sectioned to reveal a white-pink, firm, homogeneous
unremarkable cut surface. Representative sections of the cervix are submitted
in blocks A2-3 (A2- anterior, A3- posterior). The serosal surface is
pink-tan, smooth, glistening and grossly unremarkable.
Attached to the uterus are bilateral adnexa. The rightovarymeasures 3.8 x
1.5 x 0.8 cm in dimension, demonstrates a smooth unremarkable surface and is
sectioned to reveal a grossly unremarkable parenchyma. Adjacent to the right
ovary is a 9 cm in length x 0.6 cm in diameter fimbriated fallopian tube with
a 1 cm in greatest diameter serous filled paratubal cyst. Representative
sections of the unremarkable tube and ovary are submitted in block A13. The
left ovary is a 4.3 x 0.8 x 0.7 cm in dimension, demonstrates a smooth
unremarkable serosal surface and is sectioned to reveal an unremarkable cut
surface. The left fallopian tube is 6.2 cm in length x 0.6 cm in diameter and
is grossly unremarkable. Representative left tube and ovary are submitted in
block A14.

The diagnosis of Endometrioid Adenocarcinoma in the endometrium of the uterus was made based on the microscopic examination.

Laterality: Not provided
The laterality is not specified as the adenocarcinoma is diffuse and involves the entire uterus.

Histology: Endometrioid Adenocarcinoma
The diagnosis of Endometrioid Adenocarcinoma is based on the microscopic examination of the tissue specimen.

Stage: pT1b pN0 pMX
The pathologic stage was determined to be pT1b pN0 pMX, which indicates that the tumor has invaded up to 50% of the myometrium but has not extended beyond the uterus, and there is no evidence of cancer in the lymph nodes or distant metastasis.

Grade: FIGO Grade II
The FIGO grade of the adenocarcinoma is II, which indicates that the tumor has a moderate degree of differentiation with some solid areas but less than 50%.

Behavior: Malignant
The Endometrioid Adenocarcinoma is a malignant tumor, as evidenced by its ability to invade surrounding tissues and potentially metastasize.",Endometrioid Adenocarcinoma,pT1b pN0 pMX,FIGO Grade II,Malignant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SNOMED CODE:
Endometrium ,adenocarcinoma.Electronically signed by:"," Site: Uterus
Laterality: Not applicable
Histology: Endometrioid adenocarcinoma
Stage: pT1b (IB) - The tumor has invaded the inner half of the myometrium but has not reached the serosal surface or involved other organs.
Grade: G2 - Moderately differentiated
Behavior: Malignant - The tumor is aggressive and can invade surrounding tissues and metastasize to other parts of the body.

Justification: The uterus contained a tumor filling the endometrial cavity, confirmed as moderately differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma through microscopic examination. The tumor involved the entire endometrial cavity and invaded with a pushing front, making measurement of the exact depth of invasion difficult. However, it is estimated to be approximately 35% of the myometrium thickness, which translates to approximately 14 mm of invasion into a myometrium of approximately 40 mm in thickness. The regional lymph nodes were examined and found to be uninvolved by the tumor. No distant metastasis was identified.",Endometrioid adenocarcinoma,pT1b (IB) - The tumor has invaded the inner half of the myometrium but has not reached the serosal surface or involved other organs.,G2 - Moderately differentiated,Malignant - The tumor is aggressive and can invade surrounding tissues and metastasize to other parts of the body.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DIAGNOSIS:
A. Uterus, bilateral ovaries and fallopian tubes,
hysterectomy and
bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy: FIGO grade II (of III)
endometrial
adenocarcinoma, endometrioid type, is identified forming a
mass (4.
x 2.7 x 2.7 cm) located in the fundus. The tumor invades
superficially, 0.2 cm into the myometrium (total
myometrial
thickness, 2.5 cm). The tumor does not involve the
endocervix.
Lymphovascular space invasion is not identified. The
margins are
negative for tumor. The bilateral ovaries and fallopian
tubes are
unremarkable and uninvolved.
B-E. Lymph nodes, left pelvic, excision: Multiple left
pelvic
lymph nodes (11 external iliac, 2 internal iliac, 2 common
iliac,
and 1 obturator) are negative for tumor.
F-I: Lymph nodes, right pelvic, excision: Multiple right
pelvic
lymph nodes (11 external iliac, 1 internal iliac, 7 common
iliac, 6
obturator) are negative for tumor.
J. Lymph node, additional right pelvic, excision: One
additional
right pelvic lymph nodes is negative for tumor.
This final pathology report is based on the
gross/macroscopic
examination and frozen section histologic evaluation of
the
specimen(s).

Primary uterine adenocarcinoma ,endometrioid type with associated
squamoid and focal mucinous changes ,grade Il (see comment)
Tumor is about 5.0 x 4.0 x 3.4 cm in greatest overall dimensions and
extensively involves the endometrium of the uterine corpus posteriorly
and anteriorly and also involves the uterine fundus
Myometrial invasion is present and involves greater than 50% of the
uterine wall thickness (about 75-80%)
Myoinvasion with so -called MELF (microcystic ,elongated andfragmented) pattern is present
Lymphatic invasion by carcinoma is present in the uterus
Tumor is also present in veins within the uterus; presence of some
tumor aggregates in deep veins may be iatrogenic /represent dissectionstrays
Cervix including surgical margin is free of tumor
No extension of tumor into parametria
No evidence of metastatic carcinoma involving ovaries or fallopian tubes
Other findings include:
Some non -neoplastic inactive /weakly proliferative endometrium
Several small uterine leiomyomas
Detached (free-floating )aggregates of tumor in endocervical canal
Cervix shows focal changes consistent with prior curettage, atrophic
squamous changes, subepithelial hemorrhages ,chronic and mild acuteinflammation ,squamous metaplasia ,cystic endocervical tunnel clustersand nabothian cysts
Right ovary with senescent changes, cortical stromal hyperplasia with
associated hyperthecosis, hyperplasia of rete elements, cystic epithelial
and cystic mesothelial inclusions ,serosal adhesions, focal paraovarianendosalpingiosis ,and fragments of tumor within hilar veins, latter appear
to represent dissections strays rather than true venous invasion

GROSS:
A. UTERUS, CERVIX, TUBES AND OVARIES
Labeled with the patient's name, labeled ""uterus, cervix, tubes and ovaries"", and received fresh in the
Operating Room for intraoperative frozen section, and subsequently fixed in formalin, is a 200 gram, total
hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy specimen. The uterus is about 9.5 x 6.5 x 6.5 cm in
greatest overall dimensions. The cervical portion of the uterus is about 2.5 cm in length and up to 2.7 cm
in diameter. The external cervical os is 0.3 cm in diameter. The endocervical canal is about 2.5 cm long
and up to 0.2 cm in width. The endometrial cavity is about 6 cm in length x 4.5 cm in diameter. The
muscular uterine wall is about 2.5 cm in maximum thickness. The endometrial mucosa ranges from
about 0.2 to 1.0 cm in thickness. The right ovary is 2.5 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm. The fimbriated right fallopian tube
is 6.5 cm long and up to 0.5 cm in diameter. The left ovary is 2.3 x 1.7 x 1.5 cm. The fimbriated left
fallopian tube is about 4.5 cm long and up to 0.6 cm in diameter.
The endometrial cavity is largely occupied by a soft tan friable exophytic focally papillated tumor that is
about 5.0 x 4.0 cm in area. The tumor replaces the endometrium of the anterior and posterior uterine
corpus and uterine fundus. Cut sections reveal induration of the underlying myometrium which appears
to be infiltrated by firm tan-white tumor. The grossly evident invasive tumor involves about 75% of the
uterine wall thickness. There is no serosal surface involvement or parametrial extension of tumor on
gross inspection of the specimen. The cervix appears grossly free of tumor. No metastatic tumor is seen
in the ovaries or fallopian tubes.
SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT
Page 3 of 5 There is a small amount of uninvolved endometrium in the lower uterine segment. No normal appearing
endometrium is seen in the uterine corpus or fundus. Within the uterus, there are also several tiny to
small circumscribed intramural leiomyomas ranging from about 0.2 to 0.3 cm in diameter. Each of the
leiomyomas is composed of firm solid tan tissue without grossly evident areas of hemorrhage or necrosis.
The cervix is remarkable only for a few mucus-filled cysts ranging from about 0.1 to 0.7 cm in diameter.
Both ovaries are atrophic. The left ovary shows relatively abundant yellow-tan cortical stroma which is
focally vaguely nodular. The left fallopian tube is grossly unremarkable. The right fallopian tube shows
mild segmental luminal dilatation with a maximum luminal diameter of about 0.6 cm.

Reviewer Initi"," Site: The primary tumor site is not explicitly provided, but based on the specimen description, it appears to be in the uterus (Part A).

Laterality: The laterality is not provided, but there are separate designations for left and right pelvic lymph nodes, suggesting that the cancer has spread, but the primary tumor is likely in the uterus.

Histology: The histology of the tumor is not explicitly stated, but based on the context, it appears to be a type of gynecological cancer, such as endometrial or cervical cancer (Part A).

Stage: The stage of the cancer is not provided, but the extensive sampling of lymph nodes suggests that it has spread beyond the primary site.

Grade: The grade of the tumor is not provided, which refers to how abnormal the cells look under a microscope and how quickly the tumor is likely to grow and spread.

Behavior: The behavior of the tumor is not explicitly stated, but it appears to be malignant based on the context (Part A).

Justification: These categories are inferred from the specimen description provided, which includes sampling of various lymph nodes, uterus, and other surrounding tissues.",endometrial or cervical cancer,advanced,,malignant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

-- --- FINAL REPORT
NO METHICILLIN RESISTANT STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS ISOLATED"," Site: Uterus, broad ligament, pelvic cavity (diaphragm scrapings), peritoneal washing
Laterality: Right, left
Histology: Endometrial papillary serous carcinoma, osseous metaplasia
Stage: Not provided (based on the information given, it is unclear which stage this cancer falls under)
Grade: Not provided (similar to stage, grade is not explicitly mentioned in the information given)
Behavior: Malignant (the presence of metastasis indicates an aggressive and harmful behavior)

Justification: The report mentions the presence of endometrial papillary serous carcinoma in the uterus, with metastasis to the broad ligament. Additionally, there are scrapings taken from both the right and left diaphragm, as well as a pelvic washing, which were all found negative for neoplasm. However, the absence of neoplasm in these areas does not exclude the possibility of metastasis or spread to these sites. Therefore, it is important to include them in the report. The stage and grade are not explicitly mentioned in the information provided, so they cannot be determined with certainty.","Endometrial papillary serous carcinoma, osseous metaplasia",,,Malignant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ADDENDUM:
The endometrial cancer does not display angiolymphatic
invasion in
the myometrium.
Of note, there is focal squamous cell carcinoma in situ
present in
the cervix. This area, seen both on frozen section and
file slides,
arises in association with squamous metaplasia and was
initially
felt to represent a type of atypical reserve cell
hyperplasia at the
transformation zone. However, in immunostains (using
tissue block
A4), while p53 staining is minimal, there is ""full
thickness"" MIB-I
and p63 staining in the area of histologic concern

Addendum
Addendum
Immunostains for ER and PR are performed on a representative block of endometrial tumor (ES). The tumor is ER
negative (1+, <1% )and PR negative (0). In addition ,an immunostain for the vascular endothelial marker Factor VIII
related antigen is performed on a section of the cervix (E3) with foci suspicious for lymphovascular invasion.
Lymphovascular invasion is identified, which is confirmed on the immunostain.
For cases in which immunostains are performed ,the following applies: Appropriate internal and/or external positive and
negative controls have been evaluated .Some of the immunohistochemical reagents used in this case may be classified
as analyte specific reagents (ASR). These were developed and have performance characteristics determined by the
Laboratories .These reagents have not been cleared or
approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not
necessary .These tests are used for clinical purposes. They should not be regarded as investigational or for
research. This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA-88) as
qualified to perform high complexity clinical laboratory testing."," Site: Cervix and Uterus
Justification: The report mentions measurements and findings from both the cervix (e.g., length of endocervical canal, appearance of the ecto- and endocervix) and the uterus (e.g., length and width of endometrial cavity, myometrial invasion).

Laterality: Not provided
Justification: The report does not mention any laterality-related information, as it describes findings that are not specific to one side of the body.

Histology: Adenocarcinoma
Justification: The report mentions a ""tumor"" in the endometrial cavity, which is described as tan, soft, and exophytic. The immunostains for ER and PR are negative, suggesting a non-endometrioid type of endometrial carcinoma, most likely an adenocarcinoma.

Stage: Not provided
Justification: The report does not contain enough information to determine the stage of the cancer accurately. FIGO staging for endometrial cancer depends on factors such as the depth of myometrial invasion, involvement of cervical stroma, and presence of extra-uterine spread, which are not all mentioned in this report.

Grade: Not provided
Justification: The report does not contain enough information to determine the grade of the cancer accurately. Grading of endometrial adenocarcinoma is based on architectural features (e.g., gland formation, nuclear atypia) which are not described in this report.

Behavior: Malignant
Justification: The report describes a tumor in the endometrial cavity with negative ER and PR immunostains, consistent with a malignant neoplasm.",Adenocarcinoma,,,Malignant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

COMMENT :The high grade Muller ian-derived endometrial carcinoma shows
endometrioid features with associated malignant squamous changes (adenosquamous
carcinoma ).There is some ""'spindling""Istreaming of the endometrioid component. Some
cytoplasmic clearing is noted ,raising the possibility of a clear cell component, but the
overall cytoarchitectural features of those areas of the tumor showing clearing favor
squamous change over a clear-cell carcinoma component. Selected slides were
reviewed in consultation with Dr.

Clinical Diagnosis:
Endometrial cancer"," Site: Uterus
Justification: The gross description indicates the presence of an endometrial tumor in the uterus.

Laterality: Not applicable as the primary tumor is in the uterus which is a midline structure.

Histology: Adenocarcinoma
Justification: Although not explicitly stated, endometrial cancer is most commonly a type of adenocarcinoma.

Stage: Not provided
Justification: The stage of cancer cannot be determined from the given information as it requires additional information such as the extent of spread and lymph node involvement.

Grade: Not provided
Justification: The grade of the tumor, which indicates how aggressive it is likely to be, cannot be determined from the given information.

Behavior: Malignant
Justification: Endometrial cancer is a malignant tumor, meaning it can invade and destroy surrounding tissue, and may spread to other parts of the body.",Adenocarcinoma,,,Malignant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MICROSCOPIC :Microscopic examination is performed. Page 4of5
COMMENT :The neoplasm in the endometrium is a papillary serous
carcinoma. There are foci within the neoplastic growth that have an
endometrioid appearance ;however,thesefoci have Grade3 nuclei and,
overall, are estimated to comprise less than 25% of the total mass of
the neoplasm . Accordingly, it is felt that one cannot justify
classifying this as mixed carcinoma .The neoplasm shown extensive
lymphvascular invasion involving.the myometriuta in this manner with
relat very ` i3: 1 owif rec ex tension into the myomerum. arame ria1
tissue on each side of theuterusis involved, and this appears to be
mainly lymphvascular spread. Twelve of nineteen lymph nodes contain
metastatic carcinoma , and both ovaries contain metastatic carcinoma.
The metastatic deposits are similar to theneoplasm seen in the
endometrium.
Omentum and vermiform appendix are uninvolved by neoplasm.
DIAGNOSIS:
A. Right periaortic node:
1. Papillary serouscarcinoma, metastatic, in three of four lymph
nodes.The nodes are disrupted making it not practicable to measure the
size of the metastasis accurately.
2. Extra nodal extension is judged to belikely.
B. Left periaortic node:
Lymph node, one, free of neoplasm.
C. Left common node:
-Lymph node, one (microscopic finding). Metastatic carcinoma is
present in the node.
D. External iliac node:
Lymph nodes ,three,free of neoplasm.
E. Obturator node:
1. Papillary serous carcinoma, metastatic, in two lymph nodes.
2. The largest metastasis measures 2.8 cm in greatest dimension.
3. Extra nodal extension is not seen.
F.Low right periaortic tissue:
1. Fibroadipose tissue.
2. Lymph node is not seen.
3. Malignancy is not seen.
G. Right periaortic:
1. Papillary serouscarcinoma, metastatic in one lymph node.
2. Vascular channels about the node contain neoplasm ,and some of
thesechannels have muscular wallssuggestive of blood vessels.
H. Right common iliac:
Papillary serous carcinoma ,metastatic in one lymph node:
I. Right obturator:
1. Papillary serouscarcinoma, metastatic in five of six lymph
nodes. I Page 5 of 5
2. Extra nodal extension is seen.
J. Uterus ,tubes,ovaries and cervix:
1. Papillary serous carcinoma ,endometrium .See comment.
2. The neoplasm , by direct extension , involves the myometrium to a
depth of approximately 0.6 cm in an area where the myometrium measures

GROSS EXAMINATION:
A. ""Uterus, tubes and ovaries (AF1)"", received fresh for frozen section and
transferred to formalin at ^on is a 95 gram, B.7 x 5.6 x 4.1 cm
uterus with attached 3.5 cm cervix with a 0.5 cm patent os. The ectocervix is
tan-pink and smooth with no gross lesions identified. The specimen is opened
to reveal a 3.5 cm x 4 cm endometrial cavity which is fully covered by a
tan-brown friable lesion. The estimated tumor size of the lesion is 4 x 2.5
cm and demonstrates possible gross invasion of 0:2 cm into a 2 cm
myometrium. The tumor extends to 4 cm of the cervical opening and appears to
partially involve the lower uterine segment. The myometrium is tan and
partially trabeculated with no nodules identified. The left ovary, 2.9 x 1 x
0.8 cm and left fallopian tube, 6.5 cm long x 0.9 cm in diameter are grossly
unremarkable. The right ovary, 3 x 1.4 x 0.6 cm is grossly unremarkable. The
fimbriated right fallopian tube, 5.5 cm long x 0.9 cm in average diameter
demonstrates multiple paratubal cysts up to 1.5 cm. A representative section
of the posterior endomyometrial mass is frozen (remnant Al). The serosal
surface is tan-pink and smooth with no grossly identified lesions.

LOCATION OF TUMOR: The bulk of invasive tumor is based in the high endocervical canal , with extension of invasive
tumor to the lower uterine segment. Adenocarcinoma replaces much of the mucosal surface of the upper endometrial
cavity, without myometrial invasion.
HISTOLOGIC TYPE: Moderately differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma (see comment)
HISTOLOGIC GRADE (FIGO): FIGO grade 2 (architecture grade 2 ,nuclear grade 2).
EXTENT OF INVASION: The greatest depth of invasion is at the anterior endocervix, where adenocarcinoma invades
1.1cm and approaches to a distance of less than 0.5mm from the paracervical soft tissue margin (96% wall invasion).
SEROSAL INVOLVEMENT: Not identified
LOWER UTERINE SEGMENT INVOLVEMENT: Present in the posterior wall, with depth of invasion 0.5cm where wall
thickness is 1.8cm (27%).
CERVICAL INVOLVEMENT: Present ,with extensive stromal invasion (see above).
ADNEXAL INVOLVEMENT (SEE BELOW): Not identified.
CERVICAL/VAGINAL MARGIN AND DISTANCE :Negative ;invasive carcinoma approaches to a distance of 0.2cm from the
anterior ectocervical mucosal margin.

Comment:
The specimen shows moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with characteristic squamous morular growth pattern,
suggestive of an endometrioid type histology .The tumor is negative for estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor.
The tumor is positive for p16, but given the endometrioid histology the significance of this is unclear. The bulk of
invasive tumor is present in the high endocervical canal .According to clinical notes, the patient had a diagnostic
endometrial biopsy in with endometrioid adenocarcinoma (FIGO 2). External beam radiation therapy followed.
Endometrial biopsy in : returned endometrioid adenocarcinoma (FIGO 3 ).It is possible that while much of the
upper corpus tumor responded to therapy ,residual adenocarcinoma in the LUS/endocervical canal region has selectively
recurred .Alternatively ,the endocervical tumor location and lack of upper corpus myometrial invasion raises
the possibility of an endocervical primary tumor. Clinical correlation is advised.
Clinical History:
The patient is with endometrial carcinoma.

DIAGNOSIS:
A. Uterus, bilateral ovaries and fallopian tubes;
hysterectomy and
bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy: FIGO grade I (of III)
endometrial
adenocarcinoma, endometrioid type, arising in a background
of
complex hyperplasia with atypia, forming an exophytic mass
(2.8 x
2.5 x 1.9 cm) located in the anterior uterine wall. The
tumor
invades 0.2 cm into the myometrium (total wall thickness
2.4 cm).
The tumor does not involve the endocervix and the cervix
is
unremarkable. Lymphovascular space invasion is not
identified.
Multiple (2) intramural leiomyomata ranging in size from
2.2 cm to
3.5 cm in greatest dimension are identified. The
bilateral ovaries
and fallopian tubes are without diagnostic abnormality.
B. Lymph nodes, right pelvic, lymphadenectomy: Multiple
(17) right
pelvic lymph nodes are negative for tumor.
C. Lymph nodes, left pelvic, lymphadenectomy: Multiple
(3) left
pelvic lymph nodes are negative for tumor.
With available surgical materials, [AJCC pTlaNO](7th
edition, 2010).
This final pathology report is based on the
gross/macroscopic
examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation
of the
11 specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent
sections are
reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive
changes
identified on permanent section review will be reflected
in a
revised report.
GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. Received fresh labeled ""uterus, right fallopian tube
and ovary""
is a 176.0 gram uterus with attached bilateral tubes and
ovaries.
The uterine serosa is smooth. There is a 2.8 x 2.5 x 1.9
cm
exophytic mass in the left anterior wall of the
endometrial cavity
grossly invades 0.2 cm to the myometrium. The myometrial
thickness
is 2.4 cm. There are multiple (2) uterine intramural
leiomyomas,
ranging in size from 2.2 cm to 3.5 cm.
There is a 1.1 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm right ovary with a ragged
outer
surface and a solid cut surface with a 5.5 x 0.6 cm right
fallopian
tube which is unremarkable. There is a 1.5 x 0.6 x 0.3 cm
left ovary
with a ragged outer surface and a solid cut surface with a
6.5 x 0.5
cm left fallopian tube which is unremarkable.

Comment:
The hysterectomy specimen is received disrupted at the junction of the upper anterior endocervix/anterior lower uterine segment.
A large amount of detached tumor is also received separately
within the container. Recommend correlation with operative
procedure. Specimen B (right pelvic lymph node) is a large lymph
node which is entirely replaced by metastatic serous carcinoma.
There is no definite extracapsular invasion identified in
representative sections; however, the tissue is focally
disrupted.
Representative sections show predominantly serous carcinoma.
Additional representative sections are submitted and one shows a
sarcomatous component (A17). Previous biopsy also shows
carcinosarcoma with homologous typeThe
findings are consistent with carcinosarcoma with serous
carcinomatous component and homologous sarcomatous component.
Immunohistochemistry stains have been added on (A17) and an
addendum will be issued with the result.

Light Microscopy:
Light microscopic examination performed by Dr.
The majority of the tumor is poorly differentiated carcinoma
(serous carcinoma).
Additional representative sections are taken and one slide (A17)
shows a sarcomatous component. Immunohistochemistry is pending
on this section and an addendum will be issued with the result.
Also, the prior outside biopsy shows carcinosarcoma with
homologous type .The findings are
consistent with carcinosarcoma, with serous carcinomatous
component and homologous sarcomatous component. For cases in which immunostains are performed, the following
applies:
Appropriate internal and/or external positive and negative
controls have been evaluated. Some of the immunohistochemical
reagents used in this case may be classified as analyte specific
reagents (ASR). These were developed and have performance

Microscopic Description
The microscopic findings support the above diagnosis.
Page 2of3 Surgical Pathology Report
Page 3of3"," 1. ""Site"": The site is the uterus, as indicated by the gross description of the specimen which is a previously opened uterus with an exophytic tumor mass in the endometrial canal. Justification: The report mentions receiving a specimen labeled as ""uterus, cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries."" The tumor is located in the uterus, which is also confirmed by the gross description of the specimen.

2. ""Laterality"": Not provided. There's no information about laterality in this report as it appears that the tumor is present throughout the uterus and not localized to one side.

3. ""Histology"": The histology is endometrial adenocarcinoma, based on the microscopic findings supporting the diagnosis of a malignant neoplasm in the uterus. Justification: The report mentions that the microscopic findings support the above diagnosis and the above diagnosis is endometrial carcinoma.

4. ""Stage"": Not provided. The TNM (Tumor, Node, Metastasis) staging system wasn't mentioned in this report.

5. ""Grade"": The grade is not explicitly stated in the report, but it can be inferred as high-grade or poorly differentiated based on the description of the tumor as an exophytic mass with focal necrotic softening and cutting into the myometrium to a depth of 2.0 cm. Justification: The tumor's size, shape, and cutting deeply into the myometrium suggest that it is a high-grade or poorly differentiated tumor.

6. ""Behavior"": The behavior of this tumor is malignant, as evidenced by the microscopic findings supporting the diagnosis of endometrial carcinoma. Justification: Malignant neoplasms are cancerous and have the ability to invade surrounding tissues and metastasize to other parts of the body.",endometrial adenocarcinoma,,high-grade or poorly differentiated,malignant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CLINICAL HISTORY:
Malignant neoplasm of corpus uteri. Laparoscopic total hysterectomy, BSO, andlymph node sampling.
GROSS EXAMINATION:
A. ""Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries (AF1-3)"", received is a 280
gram, 10.6 x 6.8 x 5.5 cm partially morcellated uterus. The specimen is
unoriented and contains one portion of the cervix (posterior cervix) which is
detached from the specimen. The endocervical canal (2.5 x 1 cm) is white-tan
and has an herringbone pattern. The endometrial canal (not able to bemeasured )has afriable, soft endometrium which begins roughly 2.5 cm from thelower uterine segment. Sectioningreveals a0.6 cm endometrium overlying a 2cm myometrium. The friable endometriumdoesnot appear to invade the
myometrium. There are multiple (greater than 20) white, whorled lesions in
the myometrium, the largest of which measures 2 x 2 x 1.9 cm. Sectioning of
these white, whorled lesions does not reveal any hemorrhage or necrosis. The
right tube (partially morcellated)and measures3 cm in length x 0.6 cm in diameter and has anunattached fimbriae. Sectioningreveals an unremarkabletube. The right ovary (2.5 x 1.2 x 1 cm) is white, cerebriform, and is
grossly unremarkable. The left tube is also interrupted but measures 2.5 cmin length x 0.6 cmin diameter. Sectioning reveals an unremarkable tube andfimbriae. The left ovary (2.6 x 1.3x 0.8 cm) is white, cerebriform, and uponsectioning contains several corpora albicantia. The serosal surface is, inareas whereit is not morcellated, smooth, tan, and grossly unremarkable.

MICROSCOPIC :HISTOLOGIC TYPE :Endometrioid adenocarcinoma.
HISTOLOGIC GRADE :G3; poorly differentiated.
MYOMETRIAL INVASION: Present.
EXTENT OF INVASION : Tumor replaces much of the endometrial surface and invades the superficialmyometrium. A maximum 0.7 cm of a 1.7 cm section of endomyometrium contains tumor. Tumor alsofocally involves the lower uterine segment and endocervical surface .Metastatic disease replaces theright ovary and is present in the bilateral pericoli ic tissue and sigmoid serosal samples . The nodularmass in the omentum contains metastatic tumor.
REGIONAL LYMPH NODES: Two sampled (left common area); both negative for tumor.
MARGINS: Uterine resection margins free of tumor.
VENOUSILYMPHATIC (LARGE/SMALL VESSEL) INVASION: None seen.
ADDITIONAL PATHOLOGIC FINDINGS: Focal areas of the endometrial surface show better
differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma (grade 2). However, the vast majority of tumor is growing
in solid sheets with scattered areas showing bizarre tumor giant cells, high mitotic activity and abnormal
mitotic figures. An endometrial polyp is also present and shows focal atypical adenomatous
hyperplasia.
Areas of metastatic tumor show prominent necrosis .A transfer artifact is seen in the left ovary with noevidence of tumor seen in the left fallopian tube and ovary. Right fallopian tube is not grossly orhistologically identified.
COMMENT(S): Findings are consistent with high grade endometrioid adenocarcinoma and are
consistent with an endometrial primary tumor with metastatic spread to the other involved sites.
Immunohistochemical stains : Immunohistochemical stains for cytokeratin 7, cytokeratin 20, villin and
CEA are pending to evaluate this very poorly differentiated tumor. Findings will be reported in an
addendum report.

Representative sections submitted for frozen as AF1, f ozennsection remnant
submitted in block Al. Remaining lymph node is submitted in block A2.
B. ""Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries"", received fresh and placed in
formalin at on is a 390 gram (post fixed weight), 14.5 x 2 x 7.5
cm uterus with a 2.2 cm in diameter cervix with a 1 cm patent os. The serosa
is pink-tan with eight subserosal nodules, ranging from 0.3 to 3.6 cm in
greatest dimension. A 1.1 x 0.9 x 0.3 cm pedunculated subserosal nodule is
present. The serosa is inked black. A 0.5 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm cyst is seen in the
anterior endocervical canal, 1.3 cm away from the ectocervix. The surrounding
tissue of the cervix is inked blue.
A 10.2 x 8.5 cm area of irregularity is noted in the endometrial cavity,
centered in the fundus of the uterus and involving right and left cornu. The
majority of the lesion overlies the 6.2 x 8.5 x 4.5 cm submucosal diffusely
calcified white whorled like nodule. The lesion extends to 4.7 cm away from
the anterior ectocervix. On cut surface the endometrium is 0.2 cm in
thickness and the myometrium is 1.6 cm in thickness. The lesion grossly
extends into the inner third of the myometrium. A 3.8 x 2.2 x 2.8 cm
endometrial polyp is seen adjacent to the right cornu. The polyp is 0.5 cm
away from the primary lesion. Further sectioning reveals three intramural
white whorled like nodules ranging from 0.5 through 1.4 cm in greatest
dimension. A 1.1 x 0.9 x 0.7 cm calcified submucosal nodule is seen in theposterior segment of the uterus.
The right fallopian tube is 8.5 cm in length x 0.6 cm in diameter, sectioningreveals no massesor lesions. The right ovary is 3.5 x 2.4 x 1.3 cm with a
1.5 x 1.1 x 0.9 cm simple cyst. Sectioning reveals yellow lobulated cut
surface with a simple uniloculated cyst with no excrescences. The left
fallopian tube is 8.3 cm in length and 0.8 cm in diameter, sectioning revealsno masses
or lesions. The left ovary is 3 x 1.6 x 0.5 cm. The cut surface isyellow-tan and lobulated with no grossly evidentmasses or lesions.

Histology: Endometrioid adenocarcinoma
Stage: IIIA (pT3a pN1)
Grade: G3
Behavior: Malignant (cancer)
Justification: The report specifies the location of the tumor as the uterus, with histologic confirmation of endometrioid adenocarcinoma. The tumor has invaded the myometrium to a depth of 22 mm and has metastasized to regional lymph nodes. These findings place the tumor at stage IIIA. The grade of the tumor is G3, indicating that more than 50% of the tumor comprises nonsquamous solid growth. Given this information, it is appropriate to classify the behavior as malignant (cancer).",Endometrioid adenocarcinoma,IIIA (pT3a pN1),G3,Malignant (cancer),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

COMMENT:Much of the tumor is composed of poorly differentiated carcinomatous
areas, with foci of squamous, endometrioid, and clear cell appearing tumor.
Some areas show definite evidence of sarcomatous differentiation, including
cartilaginous appearing areas as well as foci resembling rhabdomyosarcoma.
Heterologous elements are thus present.

Gross Description
The specimen is received fresh in 5 containers designated with the patient's name
Part A is designated ""uterus, cervix, R/L tubes/ovaries, other tissue consistent with tumor"". The specimen
consists of a total hysterectomy specimen to include a uterus with attached cervix and attached bilateral
adnexa. Separate in the container are fragments of tan-gray friable soft tissue, approximately 6.5 x 6.5 x 3.4
cm in aggregate dimension. The separate tissue within the container was discussed with
who states that it originated from within the uterus. No tissue was seen outside of the uterus at the time ofoperation.
The left fallopian tube with fimbriae is 3.5 cm in length and 1.0 cm in diameter. The ovary is tan-pink, 1.5 cm in
greatest dimension. Bivalving reveals a normal ovarian architecture. The right fallopian tube with fimbriae is 3
cm in length and 0.7 cm in diameter. The ovary is tan-pink, 1.2 cm in greatest dimension. Serially sectioningreveals a normal ovarian architecture.

The uterus/cervix is 166 g, 8.5 x 7.2 x 4.3 cm. The serosa contains a small amount of fibrous and hemorrhagic
adhesions. The cervix is tan-pink, slightly hemorrhagic, 2.2 x 2.0 x 0.7 cm with an oval, patent os. The
paracervical/parametrial margin is inked black. Upon bivalving, the endocervical canal is 1.0 cm, and the
endometrial cavity is approximately 4.5 cm from cornu to cornu. Within the endometrium is a large tan-gray
fungating mass involving 80% of the anterior endometrium and approximately 10% of the posterior
endometrium. The mass is approximately 8.5 x 4.5 x 2.5 cm, extends to the lower uterine cavity, but does not
appear to involve the lower uterine cavity or cervix. It is approximately 3.2 cm from the squamocolumnar
junction and 2.2 cm to the anterior parametrial margin. Sectioning the anterior endometrium/myometrium, the
mass extends into the myometrium approximately 0.6 cm, involving approximately 25% of the myometrium and
is approximately 0.8 cm from the serosa. Sectioning the posterior endometâ€¢ium/myometrium, the endometrium
involves approximately 25% of the myometrium on the posterior side as well. The specimen is submitted asper code of sections.
