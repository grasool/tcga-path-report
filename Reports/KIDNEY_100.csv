GROSS DESCRIPTION:
e nay & ureter: Received fresh labeled eft kidney and ureter"" and consists of a 1151 gram
nephrectomy specimen measuring 25 x.15 x 9 an lndud ng dney measuring 22 x 12 x 6 cm and perirenal fat
ranging in thickness from 1 to 6 cm. Extending from the renal pelvis is a ureter (8 x 0.5 cm) renal artery measuring 7x
0.5 cm, and rend vein measuring 0.5 x 1 cm. The renal vein is free of gross abnormality at the margin. The specimen
is received with a surface disruption at the inferior pole and at the lateral aspect of the kidney measuring 6 cm in
greatest dimension through which friable necrotic debris extrudes. The adjacent fat is marked with black ink. In the
mid lower pole and corresponding to the capsular disruption is a well circumscribed predominantly necrotic mass
measuring 15 x 10 x 9 cm. The mass lies 1 cm from the renal vein margin and grossly extends through the renal Page 2 of 2
capsule and perirenal fat at the capsular disruption site. The remainder of the renal cortex is tan-brown with a well
defined corticomedullaryjunction. The pelvis and calyces are covered by smooth glistenin mucosa .The adipose
tissue is thinly sectioned, and no lymph nodes are found .The case is reviewed by , Representative sections
of the specimen are submitted as follows :Al) renal vein, artery and ureter margins en face ;A2-3) capsular
disruption two fragments per cassette ;A4-8) capsule wall, two fragments per cassette ;A9) non- neoplastic kidney;
Al 0) perinephritic fat.
At the request oM the specimen is regrossed with additional sections of the perlhilar blood vessels
submitted in cassettes Al 1-A15 under the direction ot^ ^s
MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
Sections of vascular and ureteral margin tissues do not show a neoplasm .Sections of the grossly described
lesion show a necrotic papillary carcinoma with patchy hemosiderin, and areas of variably foamy cytoplasm. Nuclear
characteristics show areas of prominent nucleoli and irregular nuclear borders. There is associated organizing blood.
Small vessel vascular space invasion is present .Tumor does not a ear to involve renal pelvis or hilar tissues.
Sarcomatoid areas are not seen In the examined sections.

Gross Description
A. The specimen is received fresh labeled ""right peritumoral fat."" The specimen consists of
multiple,. irregular, unoriented fragments of tobulated adipose tissue, which range from 1 to 3.5 cm in
greatest dimension.. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a grossly unremarkable cut surface.
No tissue is submitted to the Tissue Procurement Laboratory. Representative sections of the
specimen are submitted in 5 cassettes, Al-AS.
R. The specimen is received fresh labeled ""right renal mass, inferior margin.'"" The specimen
consists of an irregular fragment of fibroadipose tissue measuring 1.2 x 0.6 x 0.6 cm. The specimen
is oriented according to the surgeon's designation and inferior margin is inked blue. The specimen is
bisected and submitted entirely for frozen section as FSB1.
G. The specimen is received fresh labeled 'right renal mass, superior margin ."" The specimen
consists of an irregular fragment fibroadipose tissue measuring 1.5.x 0.4 x 0_3 cm_ The specimen
is oriented according to the surgeon 's designation and the superior margin is inked black. The
specimen is bisected and submitted entirely for frozen section as FSC1.
D. The specimen is received fresh labeled right renal mass, posterior margin. The specimen
consists of an irregular fragment of fibroadipose tissue measuring 12 cm in greatest dimension. The
specimen is oriented according to the surgeon's designation and the posterior margin is inked black.
No tissue was submitted to the Tissue Procurement Laboratory. The specimen is submitted entirety

which is entirely submitted as frozen section as FSB1.
G. The specimen is received fresh for OR consult, labeled aright renal mass, frozen section
margins and diagnosis"". The specimen consists of a moderately firm„ red-brown, irregular, renal mass
which consists of normal renal parenchyma and adipose tissue measuring 6 x 5 x 4.5 cm in overall
dimension. The surgical margin of resection is marked with black ink and the renal capsule with
adipose tissue is inked blue. Sectioning reveals a soft to somewhat firm yellow- brown, necrotic,
partially hemorrhagic mass (4 x 3.5 x 3.3 cm). The mass is located approximately 12 cm from the
surgical margin of resection .Grossly ,the mass does not appear to infiltrate the capsule. The
remaining renal parenchyma is grossly unremarkable .Additional sectioning isolates what grossly
appears to be a portion of the adrenal gland measuring 2 cm in its greatest dimension ..No tissue is
submitted to the Tissue Procurement Laboratory: Representative sections are submitted as follows:
FSCi : Frozen section of renal mass with inked parenchymal margin (perpendicular section)

encapsulated perinephric tissue, 844.0 g, 19.5 x 9.8 x 8.6 cm. The specimen is inked black. The
adrenal gland is not identified.
The cut surfaces exhibit an irregular tumor mass involving the cortex and medulla in the superior,
middle and inferior poles, 8..7 x 7.6 x 7.2 cm- The tumor is variegated, pale tan-pink and soft with
smooth lobulated sections.. Marked fibrotic septation is noted. Neither necrosis, hemorrhage or cystic
degeneration is identified. The tumor invades 90% of the calyceal system and extends to the hilum.
The renal vein, artery and ureter are probe patent, and not Involved by tumor. The tumor does not
appear to invade the renal sinus, nor penetrate through the renal capsule to involve the permephric fat..
The tumor is sharply demarcated from normal parenchyma .Satellite tumor nodules are not present-
The remaining renal parenchyma is pink -tan, smooth and glistening with a well -demarcated
rtico-medullary junction, 1.5 cm thickness- The papillae are blunted. A. segment of attached ureter
is noted (4.5 cm length x 4 mm diameter). The renal artery reveals no significant atherosclerotic

The tumor cells are arranged in papillae and tubules and exhibit moderate amount of pink eosinophilic
cytoplasm- Areas of papillae formation with foamy histiocytes are present. There is a single layer of
tumor cells with luminally placed nuclei. No nuclear stratification is identified.
Immunohistochemical stains performed show the tumor cells to be strongly postive for cytokeratin 7,
and E-Cadherin, focally positive for vimentin with weak and focal positivity for racemase. The tumor
cells are negative for CO10, RCC and CD117.

SPECIMEN (S) SUBMITTED :GROSS DESCRIPTION
1. Right kidney mass: In formalin labeled ""right kidney mass"" is a 15 x 7.5 x 6.5 cm kidney with abundant attached
perinephric fat weight 1,721 grams in aggregate. There is 3.5 cm ureter extending from the renal hilum. The kidney is
bivalved to reveal an ill defined 8.5 cm in greatest dimension variegated tan-white to red nodular tumor within the
superior pole. On cut section, the tumor grossly appears to possibly extend into the perinephric fat at the superior pole.
The lining of the renal pelvis is grey-white and slightly bosselated. Upon sectioning it appears that the tumor elevates
the urothelium and It is unclear at gross dissection whether the tumor penetrates through the urothelium into the renal
pelvis. The tumor also grossly extends into the renal artery, lying 5mm from the renal artery resection margin. The
remaining renal parenchyma is pale tan-pink with an ill defined corticomedullary junction. There is a small portion of
adrenal gland at the most superior aspect of the specimen with an orange red out surface. The gland grossly does not
appear to be involved by tumor. The perinephric fat is inked black. Representative sections are submitted in eight
cassettes as labeled: A vascular and ureter margins, B tumor to include perinephric fat, C-D tumor to include renal
pelvis, E tumor to include renal artery, F tumor to include uninvolved renal parenchyma, G normal renal parenchyma, H
adrenal gland.
2. Peri-caval node. In formalin labeled ""peri-caval node"" are two nodular tan-pink tissues which measure 3.5 x 3 x 2.3 cm

Justification: The report specifically mentions a right kidney mass, which was surgically removed.

Laterality: Right
Justification: The kidney and subsequent descriptions in the report clearly refer to the right kidney.

Histology: Papillary renal cell carcinoma
Justification: The pathologist's report describes the tumor as being composed of papillary structures with fibrovascular cores, which are lined by tumor cells with amphophilic cytoplasm and large, slightly irregular nuclei with prominent eosinophilic nucleoli. These features are consistent with a papillary renal cell carcinoma.

Stage: pT3a pN1
Justification: The pathologic tumor stage is provided in the report as pT3a pN1, which indicates that the tumor has invaded the perinephric fat and the renal vein, with positive lymph nodes present.

Grade: Not provided
Justification: The report does not mention the grade of the tumor.

Left kidney: In formalin labeled ""left kidney"" is a 762 gram, 16.5 x 11.5 x 10 cm nephrectomy specimen with attached
perinephric fat, attached 8 cm of ureter, and a 6 cm attached adrenal gland. Upon sectioning in the superior pole, there is a
12.5 cm in greatest dimension lobulated tumor .The cut surfaces of the tumor are lobulated mottled orange-red to brown, with
diffuse hemorrhage and necrosis .The tumor abuts and elevates the renal capsule ;however ,no definitive invasion beyond the
capsule into the perinephric fat is appreciated .The tumor also appears to abut the renal pelvic /calyceal mucosa ,with no gross
invasion into or through the mucosa. No involvement of the ureter or gross involvement of the vasculature is appreciated. The
remaining cut surfaces are pink -brown renal parenchyma with a defined corticomedullary junction .The out surfaces of the
adrenal gland are mottled grey-orange to brown, with no tumor involvement .There is a 1.3 cm lymph node at the kidney hilum.

covered wi~ a mantle oftan-yellow, perirenal adipose tissue 
measuring 23 x 12.5 x 10 em and weighing 1,394 grams. The 
surface shows prominent vasculature and is partially covered on 
the anterior aspect with gray-pink membranous tissue measuring 10 
x 7 em. The ureter measures 9 x 0.5 x 0.4 eni. The anterior side 
of the kidney is coated with black ink and the posterior side 
with green ink. 
On bivalving the specimen, almost the entire kidney is displa.ced 
wjth tan-yellow hemorrhagic tumor with the ex~eption of portions 
of kidney at the inferior and medial aspects. The kidney itself 
measures 13 x 8 x 8 em. Tumor is identified outside the capsule

Right renal mass. 
Gross Description 
Received in formalin and labeled ""right kidney"" is a kidney surfaced by a moderate amount of perirenal fat 
which together total 399 gm. Trimmed of fat the kidney is 133 gm, 9.3 x 5.8 x 3.8 cm. Arising from the 
renal pelvis is a 7.8 cm in length and 0.6 em in diameter segment of ureter, a 2.2 cm in length and 1 em in 
diameter segment of renal artery, and a 1.2 cm in length and 0.8 cm in diameter segment of renal vein. No 
lymph nodes are identified in the renal pelvis and no adrenal gland tissue is identified within the perirenal 
fat. The kidney is purple-brown with a faint lobulated appearance. On the inferior pole there is a 3.5 em in 
diameter spherical nodule with a yellow-tan coloration. In this area the capsule is inked black. The cut 
surface identifies a 5.5 x 3.5 x 3.5 cm mottled yellow-tan tumor mass with focal areas of hemorrhagic 
necrosis and white fibrous areas up to 1.2 cm in maximum diameter. In addition, there are cystic structures 
from 0.1 to 1 cm in diameter. Grossly, the tumor mass extends to the renal capsule but does not penetrate 
the capsule. In addition, the tumor extends into the vein ofthe renal pelvis. The remaining renal 
parenchyma is red-brown. The surface of the cortex exhibits broad-based scars up to 1.6 cm in diameter. 
In addition, there are renal retention cysts from 0.2 to 0.8 cm. The renal cortex averages 0.5 cm in 
thickness and the medulla averages 1.2 cm. No other masses or indurated areas are grossly identified. 
Summary of sections: 1 -surgical margins of the ureter, renal artery and renal vein, 2-4 -tumor mass and 
renal capsule, 5-6 -tumor mass and renal pelvis, 7 -representative section of renal parenchyma with scar, 
8 -representative section of renal parenchyma with renal retention cysts, 9-11 tumor within segmental 
branches of renal vein.

unremarkable. The renal vein stump measures 1.5 em in length and 0.5 em in diameter and 15 grossly unremarkable. On sectioning, there reveals a 
circumscrioed, golden yellow mass within the lower pole that measures 3.7 x 3.0 em that Is beneath the capsular surface. The mass does not appear to 
penetrate through the capsule into the surrounding perinephric fat The surrounding cortex is brown-tan and measures 0.7 em and shows a well

bisected kidney with attached perinephric fat measuring in total 20.0 x 12.0 x 5.0 em weighing 600 grams. The attached perinephric fat has been 
partially separated from the kidney exposing the capsule. The kidney itself measures 14.0 x 7.0 x 3.5 em. The capsular surface is gray tan with slight 
hemorrhage. The capsule has been inked. The ureter is identified and measures 7.5 em in length and 0.3 cm in diameter. The surface of the ureter is 
gray tan to brown tan with slight adhesions. The ureter is opened. The mucosal surface is gray tan. There are no lesions grossly identified, The renal 
pelvis and calices are however distorted and surrounded by a large gray tan friable yellow to brown tan mass measuring 4.5 x 4.5 x 3.0 em. The mass 
appears grossly confined to the cortex and does not appear to invade through the capsule into the surrounding perinephric fat and is within and abuts 
the capsule surface. The surrounding renal cortex measures 0,5 em and shows well demarcated renal pyramids and cortical junction, The renal artery

portion of renal vein which is bifurcated and measures 2.0 cm in length x 0.3 
cm in diameter. The ureter measures 10.0 em in length x 0.2 em in diameter. 
The external surface consists of a large amount of bosselated tan-yellow 
perirenal adipose tissue. On sectioning, a fairly well circumscribed mass is 
identified within the lower pole which measures 5.5 x 4.0 x 4.0 cm in overall 
dimension. The cut surface consists of soft, diffusely congested, red golden 
yellow tissue with scattered irregular, gray-tan, cystic areas. The solid 
tissue comprises approximately 60% of the cut surface and the cystic portion 
40%. The lesion lies subjacent to the renal pelvis and shows possible focal 
extension into the adjacent hilar fat. This focal extension is located 
adjacent to a portion of the renal artery. The mass involves 50% of the lower 
pole and also shows irregular satellite lesions composed of soft golden 
yellow-red tissue which range in size from 0.2 to 0.8 cm in greatest 
dimension. The mass is located 4.0 em from the renal artery/renal vein 
margin. The mass measures 1.0 cm from the radial soft tissue margin. The 
capsule surrounding the mass strips with ease. The remainder of the renal 
parenchyma is pink-brown with a distinct corticomedullary junction. The 
cortex measures 0.5 cm in thickness and the medulla measures 1.2 cm in

Received in a single container labeled right 
kidney is a previously bivalve right nephrectomy specimen surrounded 
by a large amount of perinephric adipose tissue and faced anteriorly 
by a moderate amount of Gerotas fascia. The specimen as received 
weighs 1320 grams and on reconstruction measures 25.6 x 14.0 x 8.5 
em. In the anterior superior medial aspect is a 5.1 x 2.4 x 1.0 em 
recognizable adrenal gland which on sectioning has a bright yellow 
cortex surrounding a hyalinized tan gray medulla. The cortex has an 
eccentric 0.7 em bright yellow chalky appearing nodule through the 
cortex in the central portion of the specimen. The margins of 
resection include 0.7 cm of grossly patent renal artery, 0.8 cm of 
grossly patent renal vein and 9.8 cm of grossly patent ureter. The 
capsule strips with slight difficulty to reveal to an organ measuring 
12.8 x 7.0 x 6.0 cm. The cortex is lobulated, slightly pale tan 
brown. The cortex measures up to 1.0 cm and is slightly granular and 
tan brown. The corticomedullary junction is poorly defined. The 
medulla is gray brown and slightly hyalinized with focal blunting of 
the papillae. The calices and pelvis at the upper pole are grossly 
distorted by the presence of a 7.8 x 6.5 x 6.2 cm lobulated tan gray 
to yellow lesion with fleshy, slightly bulging tan yellow moderately 
hemorrhagic cut surface. This lesion foc.ally appears to be slightly 
encapsulated and grossly appears to extenq beyond the plane of the 
Kidney proper, however, the le5io'n does' not appear to 'extend into the 
surrounding adipose' tissue being separated from it by attenuated

grossly patent renal vein, and 9.8 ern of grossly patent ureter. The 
capsule strips with ease to reveal an organ measuring 11.4 x 7.2 x 
5.6 em. This has a lobulated finely granular red brown cortical 
surface. The specimen is previously sectioned in the low posterior 
pole to reveal an eccentric 2.7 x 2.5 x 2.2 em well circumscribed 
thinly encapsulated chalky gray yellow to brown focally hemorrhagic 
lesion. On sectioning this lesion has a tan pink to yellow focally 
hemorrhagic cut surface but appears grossly confined to the capsule. 
This grossly appears to focally extend to within 0.1 em of the 
cortical margin; however, the lesion does not appear to extend beyond 
the capsule into the cortex. The surrounding parenchyma is slightly

HISTORY
Renal mass
(StageIV chronic kidney diseasewith history of renal transplant)
GROSS
Received fresh in a container labeled left kidney"" is a kidney with
a moderate amount of attached perinephric fat (12.5 x 8 x 4.8 cm).
The kidney by itself (9.5 x 3.8 x 3.2 cm), weighs 78 grams. Hilar
vessels are up to 0.8 cm long, 2.5 cm in diameter. The renal vein
lumen is widely patent. The attached ureter (2.5 cm long, 0.4 cm in
diameter) has a metal clip across the lumen adjacent to the margin.
The inferior pole of the kidney has a 4 cm in diameter discrete
tumor nodule with a mottled, spongy orange gray cut surface.
Scattered areasof hemorrhage are present throughout. The tumor has
a discrete pushing margin, which produces a bulge in the overlying
intact capsule. Extension into the adjacent perinephric fat is not
apparent. The overlying adventitia margin is marked with black ink.
Superiorly, the tumor margin is within 0.2 cm of the renal sinus
fat.Direct extension into perinephric fat is not apparent. The
remaining renal parenchyma has athin, atrophic firm tan cortex (up
to 0.5 cm thick) and numerous cortical cysts containing clear fluid
and old, brown'blood. Renal pyramids are atrophic. Major and minor
calices along with the renal pelvis are lined by mildly striated
gray-white mucosa.

Renal mass
Gross Description:
The specimen is labeled left kidney and is received in formalin. It consists of a nephrectomy specimen
which together with perinephric fat weighs 446 grams. It measures 17.5 cm from superior to inferior, 9 cm
from medial to lateral, and 4.5 cm from anterior to posterior. Along the medial-superior edge of the
perinephric fat there is a intact appearing 6.5 x 3.5 x 1 cm portion of adrenal gland. Along the anterior
surface of the kidney there Is a thin delicate membranous tissue consistent with Gerota 's fascia
approximately measuring 10 x 5 cm. The central-lateral surface of the nephrectomy specimen is torn and
disrupted exposing the cortical surface of the kidney which Is bulging .Serial sections of the adrenal gland
reveal no gross evidence of tumor involvement. At the hilum of the kidney the renal artery and renal vein
are identified. The vessels are opened and there is no gross evidence of intraluminal tumor. Extending
from the hilum of the kidney is a small caliber portion of ureter which is 6.5 cm in length and 0.3 cm In
diameter. The ureter is opened to the renal pelvis to reveal the urothelium Is tan-white and smooth and
unremarkable. Sectioning through the central-lateral surface of the kidney reveals a well circumscribed
golden yellow and thinly capsulated appearing neoplasm which overall measures 3.3 x 3.2 x 2.8 cm. This
neoplasm abuts the cortical surface of the kidney but grossly does not appear to extend through the renal
capsule Into the small amount of adherent perirenal adipose tissue .The neoplasm Is 3.5 cm from the
hilum and hilar vascuiature. There is some cautery and cavitation of the renal parenchyma just along the
superior edge of the tumor suggestive of surgical manipulation .There is some hemorrhage extending
into the hilar fat. The kidney away from the neoplasm has a normal reddish brown appearance and the
cortical medullary junction appears distinct. The cortical thickness is 0.7 cm. Close sectioning of the
remainder of the kidney reveals no additional masses. The perinephric adipose tissue is dissected but no
lymph nodes are identified grossly. Also in the specimen container is an additional 7.5 cm aggregate of
lobulated fatty tissue which is serially sectioned and palpably unremarkable. Representative sections of
the tumor are obtained for research purposes. Following fixation the sections are submitted as
summarized below: Section summary: Al) surgical margin, renal artery, renal vein and ureter, A2)
adrenal gland, A3) additional sections of ureter and ureteral pelvic junction, A4) Gerota's fascia, A5-A7)
sections of central-lateral tumor and cortical surface of kidney, A7-A8) sections of tumor and immediately
adjacent renal tissue. Additional section of tumor adjacent to the renal sinus was submitted in Al 0, and
an additional section of renal artery and renal vein are submitted in cassette Al 1.^
