The specimen is received fresh. labeled '\" segment 5 resection\". The specimen consists of\n604.0 gram segmentectomy resection of liver which measures 1x6.0 x 11.0 x 7.0 cm. The capsule of\nthe specimen is pink-tan to red-brown, focally hemorrhagic, and has bosselated surface. The\nparench^,anal resection margin is tan-red-brown, focally cauterized and is inked blue. The specimen is\nserially sectioned to reveal an irregular, ill-defined lobulated intraparenehymal tumor mass which\nmeasures 11.0 x 9.0 x 7.0 cm. The tumor is bulging capsule and is 1.0 cm from the closest\nparenchymal resection margin- T G tumor mass is focally hemorrhagic and necrotic... The areas of\nnecrosis range from 0.1 to -2_5 cm in greatest dimension, and occupy less than 10% of the tumor.\nRepresentative section of the tumor in relation to the closest parenchymal resection margin is\nsubmitted for frozen section as FSAI. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted to the\nTissue Procurement Laboratory- Additional sections of the specimen are submitted in 6 cassettes as\nfollows:\nA2-A5,.

However, without further clarification, I cannot be certain.\n\nLaterality: Not provided\n\nHistology: The specimen consists of a \"stony\" ovoid mass with granular brown tissue and an irregular border, which suggests a diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or another type of malignant liver tumor.

Likewise, there is a documented though rare\nassociation of DPM/VMCs with cholangiocarcinoma.The significance of this finding, with\nregards to potential causality for (or contribution to) neoplasia, is unclear in the\npathology literature.With regards to vascular invasion, scattered foci of tumor present\nin medium-sized portal/septal type veins are identified. \" Major\"venous invasion, per\nAJCC/CAP definition, cannot be assessed in this specimen.\nGrossDescription\nReceived is a single specimen cons-'---\"\"- 'airs^n and specimen container are\nlabelled with the patient' s name, .The cassette and identifiers\nare labelled with the Surgical Number\nA.Specimen is received fresh.

The surrounding, non-neoplastic\nliver shows some bile stasis, which is predominantly intrahepatocellular. There is mild bile duct\nproliferation and scattered neutrophilic aggregates within portal areas and sinusoids. These findings are\nsuggestive of a biliary obstruction, possibly secondary to the tumor. Also present are mild portal\nlymphocytic infiltrates, consistent with a mild (Grade 1) chronic hepatitis.

There is both a micro-\ntrabecular as well as a macro-trabecular pattern. Focal pseudo-acinar structures are also\nseen. There are focal areas of tumor necrosis and hemorrhage. Focal changes suspicious for\nlymphovascular space invasion are observed in the capsule(section #8). There was a single nodule of\ntumor without any apparent satellite lesions. The tumor appears to be well differentiated and does not\ninvolve in the surgical margins. The adjacent liver tissue has a normal hepatitic architecture without\nsignificant fibrosis. Steatosis was also absent.\nDIAGNOSIS\nLIVER MASS, LEFT LOBE, PARTIAL HEPATITIC RESECTION\n- HEI ATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA, %VELL DIFFERENTIATED, PREDOMINANTLY\nTRABECULAR PATTERN, 8.0 CM IN GREATEST DIMENSION\n- SURGICAL MARGINS CLEAR\nUUID:AOF69933-CBDD-492D-9564 -AEBFB2F9CE38TCGA-RC-A10S-01A-PRRedacted\nIII IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII iiiiiiillll iillllllilllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll IIIItea\nAUrIEDD UAIfILD\n- wewerl:Z -\nI",

The specimen consists of a 1050 g, 15 x 15 x\n15 cm partial hepatectomy specimen, portions of which have been sampled for frozen section and given to\nTissue Procurement. The margin of resection has been inked in black. The hepatic surface is generally\nsmooth and glistening with a 10.5 x 6.0 cm portion of adherent diaphragm and parietal pleura. Serial\nsectioning reveals a 12 x 10 x 10 cm, fairly well-circumscribed, yellow/tan mass with large areas and\nnecrosis and hemorrhage noted. The mass has a vaguely nodular character along with occasional fibrous\nseptations noted. The mass appears to come within 0.3 cm from the inked surgical margin.

Within container E is a 3.5 x 1.5 x\n1.0 cm, roughly triangular portion of gray/purple soft tissue with a stapled edge. Two fairly well\ncircumscribed, variegated, white/red nodules are noted in the lung parenchyma measuring 0.4 and 0.3 cm in\ngreatest dimension. The specimen is serially sectioned and entirely submitted.\nE1 - portion of lung closest to stapled margin\nE2,E3 - remaining specimen\nContainer F is additionally labeled \"face of right lower lobe\".

It holds a 2 x 1 x 0.8 cm, single, irregularly-\nshaped, black/tan soft tissue fragment. G 1\nLight Microscopy:\nLight microscopic examination is performed.\nSections of the gallbladder show chronic cholecystitis with cholesterolosis. The cystic structure noted adjacent to gallbladder lumen and examined by frozen section is grossly unconnected to the lumen of the\ngallbladder and unlike the gallbladder mucosa is not stained with bile. It consists of a round cystic structure\nlined by columnar epithelium and completely surrounded by a thick smooth muscle wall. The\nlining mucosa in multiple foci concentrically around the lumen penetrates the wall in a Rokatansky-\nAschoff-like pattern.. These features are consistent with a gallbladder duplication cyst. Sections of the liver\ntumor show a tii atel^idifterentlated epatocellular carcinoma with large numbers of PAS-positive\nalpha-l- antitrypsin inclusions. Trichrome and reticulin stains demonstrate biliary fibrosis\nin the adjacent parenchyma. The iron stain is non-contributory. Tumor infiltrates the inferior surface of the\ndiaphragm with some destruction and fibrosis of skeletal muscle of the diaphragm. However, the\ndiaphragm is not penetrated by tumor.\nThe right lower lobe of the lung, on the immediately adjacent diaphormatic surface shows striking\nmesothelial proliferation, but no tumor is identified.\nThe three lymph nodes submitted show reactive hyperplasia but no evidence for metastatic hepatocellular\ncarcinoma.\nI have personally conducted the evaluation of the above specimens and have rendered the above\ndiagnosis(es).",

The appendix\nranges from 1.5 cm in diameter proximally and 0.7 cm in diameter\ndistally. The outer surface of the appendix is tan, glistening\nand smooth. At the appendiceal orifice there is a 1.9 x 1.5 x\n1.3 cm brown soft friable polyp. The polyp comes to within 1.0\ncm away from cecal margin. Further sectioning reveals that the\npolyp has a stalk measuring 0.5 cm in length and 0.5 cm in\ndiameter. The polyp appears mucosal based. The cecal mucosa is\ntan/yellow and glistening. The remainder of the appendix is void\nof luminal contents with the mucosa appearing pale, tan with\nfocal areas of hemorrhage with a wall thickness of 0.2 cm.

Tissue was received with a stitch on one side and is\nbrown and smooth and inked blue. The opposite side is brown with\nfocal areas of cauterization and inked black. Sectioning reveals\nbrown unremarkable liver parenchyma. The specimen is entirely\nsubmitted in block El-E6,\nLight Microscopy:\nLight microscopic examination is performed by Dr.\nThe sections show hepatocellular carcinoma involving the portal\ntract margin (Bl), the surgical margin in specimen B and also\nthe separately submitted medial (specimen D) and anterior\nmargins (specimen E). The carcinoma is detached in specimen D\nand uninked; therefore, the carcinoma in this specimen cannot be\noriented as to old versus new margin in specimen D. In specimen\nE.the carcinoma involves both the old and the new margin.\nStains are performed on the portal tract margin (B1) and the\ncarcinoma in this section is positive for glypican 3 and shows\nwidened trabeculae by reticulin staining. The\nimmunohistochemistry is supportive of portal tract margin\ninvolvement in Specimen B.\nThe hepatocellular carcinoma abuts capsule with an overlying\nfibrous serosal adhesion, reactive mesothelial cells and\nhemosiderin laden macrophages. Immunohistochemistry is performed\non the section with capsule (B4). HEPAR-l is negative within the\nfibrous adhesion and calretinin highlights reactive mesothelial\ncells. The carcinoma abuts capsule; but no diagnostic\ninvolvement of capsule is identified. The hepatocellular carcinoma shows both trabecular and\npseudoglandular (acinar) architecture. Immunohistochemistry is\nperformed on a representative section of carcinoma (B5). HEPAR-1\nstains a subset including the gland forming areas.\nGlypican 3 is positive. CK7 is positive in a subset including\nboth the glandular and non-glandular architecture. CD5 is\nnegative. The findings are consistent with a hepatocellular\ncarcinoma with areas of pseudoglandular architecture. No\nadenocarcinoma (cholangiocarcinoma or metastatic colorectal\ncarcinoma) is identified.\nThe background liver is cirrhotic with mild steatosis (< 10%,\npredominately macrovesicular). No definite active\nsteatohepatitis is identified. Special stains are performed on\nthe representative uninvolved liver (B8). Reticulin and\ntrichrome highlight stage 4 fibrosis. Iron highlights scattered\niron within hepatocytes and mostly within Kupffer cells. PASD\nstains macrophages in sinusoidal areas,and is negative for\nalpha-1 antitrypsin particles.\nIn the cecal margin block of specimen A (A2) there is apparent\ndetached benign appearing liver tissue. HEPAR-1 is positive in\nthese detached fragments confirming liver in this section. This\nmay represent floater versus adhesion to liver.

ADDENDA:\nAddendum\nMolecular Anatomic PathologyTesting:\nBlock 3A, microdissection target 1 (TI):\nA. Lose of heterozygosity is IDENTIFIED at chromosomeSq (371).B.

Fractional Allelic Loss is 8%(1 locus with loss/12 informative loci).\nNote;\nLON of high amplitudeis considered when more than 75% of cellular DNA is affected.\nLoss of heterozygosity of tumor suppressor gene alleles is knownto occur inliver neoplaeias and to correlate with tumor progression. As reported in theliterature, benign neoplasms (hepatic adenoma and focal nodular hyperplasia)typically have low frequency of LOH (mean tractional allelic lose -61) and hepatocellular carcinomas (BCC) frequently have higher prevalence of LOX (meanfractional allele loss -301) (1,2). Some studies have shown that MCC with\nPAL of 430% are associated with indolent biological behavior and PAL of >30%with an aggressive biological behavior (3-5). LOU mutations are reported ashigh amplitude when more than 754 of cellular DNA is affected.Some HCC with low amplitude LOX mutations and PAL 25 -35 4 considered to be indeterminatebiological behavior .However,not all tumors reveal such a correlation and,therefore , the LOH profileshould be interpreted in the context of thecytologicand histologic findings and the patient'a clinical history.Sample Preparation and LOH Analysis\nManual microdissection of the tissue sample was performed to include tumor\ntissue and normal adjacent tissue if available)or a blood sample. DNA wasisolated using standard laboratory procedure.Specimens with the minimum of\nS0% of tumor cells in a microdisseetion target are accepted for the analysis.\nOptical density readings were obtained.\nEighteen microsatellite markers (listed below )that have been previously foundto be involved in liver neoplasia and/or co-localize with known tumor\nsuppressor genes were used for analysis.FCR was performed using\nfluorescently labeled primers and the products of amplification were detected\nusing capillary electrophoresis on A613730 platform .Relative fluorescence was\ndetermined for individual alleles and the ratio of peaks was calculated\n. Normal tissue was examined to determine whether the\npatient is heterozygous at the marker (genetically informative )and neoplactic\ntissue was then analyzed to detect lose of heterozygosity .Thresholds for\nsignificant allelic imbalance were determined using normal(non-neoplastic)\nspecimens for every marker .Loss of heterozygosity was determined using (NL /Na)! (TL /TS) formula and reported when allelic ratio for a particular marker\nwas below 0.5 or above 2.0. when normal tissue was not available ,peak height\nratios falling outside of 2 We beyond the mean for each polymorphic allele\niparngwere assessed asshowing lose of heterozygosity.\nD13407 1p36 - CMtI/RIZ\nD1S171 1p36 CMM/RIZ\nD3S1539 3p26 VHL/OGGl\n035516 3p26 VHL/OGGI\nD5S1384 5g23 APC\nDSS6IS Sg23 APC\nD89254 8p22 ---\n033261 0p22 ---\n093251 9p21 CDM:N2A\n0981748 9p23 CDIO 2A\nD10S520 1Og23 PTEN\nDLOSII73 1Og23 eTXN\n0178974 17p13 TP53\n01791269 17p13 TP53\nD17S1877 17q23 Her2/neu\nD18S487 18g21 DCC\nD21S1256 21g22 ETS2\nD22S268 22g13 NF2i\"'Y %mo, Site\n11PM Dlsuepanry\n',la Mai{nancy N / NSto\nP rim\n:aa I:lr;rrcle):\nI.-e, In\n1.

However, specific values for PAL are not given.\n\nBehavior: Based on the PAL values mentioned in the text, it can be inferred that the tumor with a PAL of 430% or more has an aggressive biological behavior, and a PAL between 25-35% is considered indeterminate for biological behavior. However, specific information about the tumor's behavior is not provided.\n\nTherefore, the answers are:\n\nSite: Liver neoplasia (inferred)\nLaterality: Not provided\nHistology: Hepatic adenoma or hepatocellular carcinoma (inferred)\nStage: Not provided\nGrade: Not explicitly stated\nBehavior: Indeterminate or aggressive (based on PAL values, but not specifically mentioned for this tumor)."

Laterality: Not provided in the report.\n3. Histology: The histological diagnosis is adenocarcinoma, as stated in the \"Histological Diagnosis\" section of the report.\n4. Stage: The pathological stage is pT3 No M0, which indicates that the tumor has grown into the surrounding tissues but has not spread to distant sites or lymph nodes.\n5. Grade: The grade of the tumor is not explicitly mentioned in the report; however, it can be inferred to be moderately differentiated based on the description \"moderately well-differentiated adenocarcinoma\" found in the IRS Approval section.\n6. Behavior: The behavior of this tumor is malignant, as it is an invasive cancer that can spread to other parts of the body.\n\nJustification: These six categories are chosen because they provide essential information about the tumor's characteristics and help guide treatment decisions.

The report does not mention any laterality as it's a resected right lobectomy of the liver, so there's no equivalent concept of laterality here.\n3. \"Histology\": Hepatocellular carcinoma. This is specified in the report where it mentions \"Grade 2 (of 4) hepatocellular carcinoma\".\n4. \"Stage\": pT2 N0 M0. The tumor is solitary with vascular invasion but no regional lymph node metastasis or distant metastasis, as per the report.\n5. \"Grade\": II. The tumor is moderately differentiated, as mentioned in the report.\n6. \"Behavior\": Malignant. This is inherent in the classification of 'carcinoma' which is a malignant tumor."
