Focally, in one residual bronchus , an area of in \nsitu adenocarcinoma is identified. In addition , some subpleural \nfibrosis is present suggesting that this is a primary adenocarcinoma \nas opposed to a metastatic adenocarcinoma. A panel of \nimmunohistochemical stains is performed including CK7, CK20, CDX2, \nand TTF1 (with appropriate positive and negative controls). The \nneoplastic cells are strongly positive for CK7. The neoplastic \ncells demonstrate some scattered focal positive stain for CK20. The \nneoplastic cells demonstrate focal weakly positive staining TTF1. \nIn addition, the neoplastic cells demonstrate a rare focal positive \nstaining cell for CDX2. \nThis demonstrates a well differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma. \nThe subpleural fibrosis would suggest this represents a primary lung \nneoplasm, however, the immunohistochemical stains are equivocal and \ntherefore the possibility of a metastatic lesion cannot be fully \nexcluded on histologic grounds alone.

Below the hilum there is a finn tumour which measures 68 x 65 mm in \nmaximal dimension and has a finn sclerotic cut surface. Towards the superior aspect of this there is a \nfinn node which is adherent to the medial aspect of the tumour. Further enlarged nodes are present \nsurrounding the inferior aspect of the bronchial resection margin and pulmonary artery. The tumour \nabuts the pleural surface on this medial aspect but appears clear of the lateral aspect by approximately \n10 mm. On sectioning there are areas of necrosis and the tumour has a sclerotic cut face. Elsewhere \nthere is apical scarring. Distal to the tumour there is evidence of obstructive pneumonitis and in the \nbasal aspect of the lung there is a finn grey nodule.

[Blocked in toto, SA] \nMICROSCOPIC \nI: Sections show a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Patchy necrosis is present. \nVascular invasion is presenl but the pulmonary artery is clear of malignancy. No pleural, lymphatic or \nperineura l invasion is identified. The bronchial resection margin is clear of malignancy and shows no \nevidence of squamous metaplasia or dysplasia. Obstructive pneumonitis is confinned adjacent to the \ntumour. A way from the tumour there are at least three further distinct lesions. The first is the nodule \nnoted in the lower zone which comprises granulomatous inflammation including numerous giant cells \nof Langhans type with surround ing lymphocytic infiltration and fibrosis. A few tiny foci of necrosis \nare present within this nodule. There are [wo further foci of granulomatous inflammation with \nextensive central necrotic debris surrounded by foamy macrophag es and fibrosis. These appear to be \ncentred on bronchi. No organisms are identified in any of these lesions with Grocott or ZN stains. \nHowever the appearances are highly suspicious for infection, and I note that atypical Mycobacteria \nhave been found previously in sputum. The peribronchial lymph nodes are confmned to contain \nmetastatic squamous cell carcinoma, and they also have foci of fibrosis and dystrophic calcification, \nbut they show no evidence of granulomatous inflamma tion. \n2: Sections of the pulmonary artery show no evidence of malignancy . \n3: Sections of the lymph node show multiple silicotic nodules together with extensive sheets of \npigmented macrophages but there is no evidence of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma. \n4: Sections show lymph nodes with a follicular hyperplasia, sinus histiocytosis and aggregates of \npigmented macrophages.

The neoplastic cells have prominent \nnucleoli, and do not have the cytologic appearance of small \ncell carcinoma, grade II neuroendocrine carcinoma (atypical \ncarcinoid) or large cell neuroendocrine carCinoma. \nImmunohistochemical stains are performed. The neoplasm \nstains positively for cytokeratin CK7 as well as forTTF-1. \nThe neoplasm is negative for CK20, high molecular weight \nkeratin SK and p63. The findings support the diagnosis of .-\n_gdenocarcinoma of lung primary. There is weak staining for \nsynaptophysin. It 1s felt 1n that this is an example of \nnon-neuroendocrine carcinoma {adenocarcinoma) that shows \npositive staining for synaptophysin, and that it should not \nresult in classification of a neuroendocrine tumor. \nCurrent NCCN practice guidelines recommend determination of \nEGFR and KRAS mutation status in adenocarcinoma of lung to \nhelp select patients for Tyrosine-Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) \ntherapy. EGFR-activating mutations have been shown to be \nsignificantly associated with response to TKis and KRAS \nmutations are associated with TKI resistance. They are \nmutually exclusive in NSCLC. Additionally, recent data show \nthat ALK (Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase) gene rearrangements in \nadenocarcinoma of lung are associated with resistance to \nTKis and have favorable response rates to Crizotinib, the \nALK inhibitor agent currently in clinical trials. Mutation \nanalysis for KRAS and EGFR-TK domain and ALK gene \nrearrangement by FISH is available as the Lung Cancer \nMutation Panel. Testing may be performed on \nparaffin-embedded tissue from the primary or metastatic \ntumor or pleural fluid cell block.

Received fresh in a container labeled \"right upper \nlobe\" is a 296 gm, 17.8 x 11.8 x 4 em, lung lobe compatible \nwith right upper lobe. In the hilar region there is an 0.8 em long \nand 1.5 em in diameter bronchial stump which is grossly \nunremarkable. The vessels at the margin are also grossly \nunremarkable. There are some tan-gray lymph nodes up to 1.2 em in \ngreatest dimension in the hilar region. The pleural surface is \npink-purple with some anthracotic pigment deposition. There .is some \nretraction of the pleural surface. The specimen is sectioned, and \nthere is a 2.6 x 2 x 1.8 em rubbery tan-white mass underlying the \narea with pleural retraction1 with the mass suggestive of invading \nthe pleura. Approximately 2 em from this mass is a separate 4 x 3.5 \nx 3.1 ern rubbery tan-white mass. This mass approaches at least near \nto the pleural surface. The larger lesion has yellow-orange \ndiscoloration surrounding it, suggestive of surrounding pneumonia. \nThe remainder of the parenchyma is spongy and red-purple without \naddi tiona! lesions. RS-13, follmving fixation. \nBLOCK SUt~1ARY: Al -bronchial margini A2 -vascular margin; A3-A5 -\nfirst lesion described; A6-A9 -larger lesioni AlO -parenchyma \nsurrounding larger lesioni All-random lungi Al2 -two hilar lymph \nnodes; A13 -bisected hilar lymph node. \nGROSS DESCRIPTION \nB. Received fresh in a container labeled \"level 11\" are \ntwo pieces of soft red-gray tissue, 0.7 em in greatest \naggregate dimension. AS-1, following fixation. \nC. Received fresh in a container labeled \"2R\" are four \npieces of soft red-gray tissue, 3 em in greatest aggregate \ndimension. AS-2, following fixation. \nD. Received fresh in a container labeled \"4R\" are multiple \nsimilar fragments of tissue, in aggregate 2.7 x 1 x 0.5 em. \nAS-3, following fixation. \nE. Received fresh in a container labeled \"level 7\" is a \nsimilar portion of tissue, 1.5 em in greatest dimension. \nAS-2, following fixation. \nMICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION \nThe follm'ling template surrunarizes the findings in this \ncase: \nHistologic type: Both of the mass lesions consist of poorly \ndifferentiated non-small cell carcinoma. There are areas that it is \nfavored have squamous differentiation, as well as less frequent \nfoci suggestive of glandular differentiation (adenocarcinoma). \nAlthough not entirely identical, the two lesions look similar. \nHistologic grade: Poorly differentiated \nPrimary tumor (pT): These two lesions are grossly 2.6 em and 4 em \nin greatest dimension. The 2.6 em in diameter lesion has visceral \n pleural invasion, with the larger lesion extending very \nperipherally but without definite visceral pleural invasion. \nAlthough it is difficult to definitely distinguish between \nsynchronous primaries and the two masses being part of the same \nprocess, given the similarities in appearance, based on the new \nguidelines, two nodules of similar histology in the same lobe \nMICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION \nwould be classified as pT3, Clinical correlation is recommended. \nMargins of resection: The bronchial and vascular resection margins \nare negative. \nDirect extension of tumor: Visceral pleural extension for the 2.6 \nem in diameter lesion, no direct extension identified for the larger \nlesion. \nVascular invasion: Not definitively identified. \nRegional lymph nodes (pN): pNl. There is metastatic carcinoma in \none of three hilar lymph nodes in part A. The separately submitted \nlymph nodes in parts B, c, D, and E are negative for malignancy. \nDistant metastasis {pM} : pMX \nOther findings: There are inflammatory changes surrounding the \ntumors, with focally prominent pneumonia surrounding the larger \nlesion. \nNote: This case has been reviewed in Intradepartmental consultation \nwith all reviewers interpreting the two mass lesions as similar in \nappearance. \n3,4x3,5 \nDIAGNOSIS \nA.

The analytical sensitivity of\nthe assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low\npercentage of cells may not be detected.\nThis test is validated for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and\ncodon 13 mutations in fresh, frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin\nembedded tissue. In particular the test performance has been\nestablished in samples of colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung\ncarcinoma which harbor these mutations, although several other\ntissues are also known to harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of\npancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix, etc.).\nMETHOD/LIMITATIONS:\nTissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is\nselected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample ,quantified\nand amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to\nexon 2 of the KRAS gene .PCR products are subjected to single\nnucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;\nprimer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel\nelectrophoresis and fluorescence detection .False positive or\nnegative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants\nor somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.\nREFERENCES:\nNSCLC\nMascaux C, lannino N, et al.

Electronically signed by:\nDate:\nAddendum #1 performed by\nADDENDUM #2:\nINTEGRATED ONCOLOGY\nEGFR Mutation Analysis\nReferring Physician: .\nBody Site: Lung\nClinical Data :Adenocarcinoma\nRESULTS: No mutation detected.\nINTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified in the sample provided\nfor analysis .Fewer than 5% of non -small cell lung carcinoma\npatients without identifiable mutations are reported to be\nresponsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies. COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more tumor cellularity is optimal\nfor this mutation analysis .The sample submitted showed 80% tumor\ncellularity upon pathologist review.\nA frequently occurring sequence change 2361 G>A (Q787Q) was\nidentified. This polymorphism is known not to have clinical\nsignificance.\nMutations in the tyrosine domain of the epidermal growth factor\nreceptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with differential\nresponsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)\ntherapies. The objective response rate among patients with a\nsensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%.\nThis assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain;\nbased on the current literature, most mutations in non -small-cell\nlung carcinoma (NSCLC) are expected to occur in these exons.\nMutations present in less than 10-20% of extracted DNA may not be\ndetected by this method. Mutation status in a sample may change\nduring tumor progression or the course of therapy; therefore, this\nresult cannot be used to infer the presence or absence of a mutation\nin another sample or sub -sample obtained from this tumor.\nThis test is validated for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The\nclinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types\nis unknown.\nMETHOD/LIMITATION:\nTissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is\nselected for analysis .DNA is isolated from the samples, quantified\nand amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to\nexons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by\nbi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary gel\nelectrophoresis and fluorescence detection .False positive or\nnegative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants\nor somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.\nREFERENCES:\n1.Azzoli CG, et al, J.

C34.3 M 8255/3 G3.  \nComment/supplementary remark:   \nWithin the main tumor and the lymph node metastases, which are found within the lung in the \nparabronchial region, at the hilus and in sample 5, the large-cell solid tumor component, which has a partly clear -cell character, is predominant. Especially in the area of the main \ntumor margin and the surrounding area the carcinoma shows glandular tubulopapillary and bronchioloalveolar differentiation. No maturation pattern of squamous epithelium is evident on conventional histology (immunohistochemical analysis will follow to provide as definitive confirmation as possible of the bronchopulmonary origin of the tumor and thus exclusion of a late metastatic spread of the reported breast carcinoma). The RX category is explained by the fact that the tumor infiltrating the pleura and disseminated there extends as far as the pleural surface and, with the detection of carcinoma cells in the pleural effusions, the possibility cannot be excluded that some of them remained there. The central bronchus resection line and the resection margins of the large pulmonary vessels and the resection pr eparation of parietal \npleura itself, as registered under 4., are tumor- free \n  Result of immunohistochemical analysis: a major part of the tumor cells with double expression of low and high molecular weight keratins (M903 and 902). In the glandular differen tiation component, tumor cell nuclei are positive TTF1.  \n The immune profile confirms the diagnosis of an adenocarcinoma of the lung of mixed differentiation.  \n  \n",

However, based on the procedures performed (bronchoscopy and thoracoscopy), it could be a lung cancer or another type of lung mass.\n\nStage: The stage is not provided in the text, as it would require additional information such as the size of the mass and whether it has spread to nearby lymph nodes or other organs.\n\nGrade: The grade is also not provided in the given text. Grade refers to how abnormal the cancer cells look under a microscope and how quickly the cancer is likely to grow and spread.\n\nBehavior: The behavior of the mass cannot be determined without more information, such as whether it is benign or malignant.\n\nJustification for the choices: The site, laterality, stage, grade, and behavior are not explicitly provided in the text, and the histology can only be inferred based on the procedures performed.

Part A is submitted fresh for tissue procurement, \n             labeled \"lingula\".  It consists of an elongated portion of \n    lung tissue, measuring 18 x 4 x 2 cm. maximally.  It has been \n    amputated along an entire edge, which has steel clips and paper tape \n    present.  There is an area of pleural puckering opposite the tape, \n    which has drawn the pleura into a stellate- like area, with a \n    palpable mass deep to that.  The pleura is focally torn along \n    another portion of the specimen.  Black ink is applied over the area \n    of the scar and then the specimen is serially sectioned.  This \n    reveals the presence of a nodular tumor mass immediately beneath the \n    pleura, in the region of the above- mentioned scar.  That tumor mass \n    measures maximally 2 x 1.5 x 1.3 cm.  Sections through the remaining \n    pulmonary parenchyma reveal a consolidated bloody red tissue, \n    without other focal nodules present.  There is some adherent fat \n    present on the pleural surface.  Representative tumor and normal \n    ions are submitted for tissue procurement, per request of \n      Sections after fixation. \n      Part B is submitted fresh, labeled \"Level 10 lymph \n             node\".

Collection \nE. EML41ALK rearrangement NOT identified (see In Situ Procedure). \nNote: \nKRAS codon 12/13 mutations are found in approximately 10-30% lung adenoyarclnomas and associated with history of \nsmoking, The presence of KRAS mutation leads to resistance to EGFR ~ therapies (1). EGFR exon 19 and 21 \nmutations are present in about 10% of  and up to 40% in th..-,opulation, common in and \nassociated \nwith the clinical response to treatment with EGFR inhibitors (2). These mutations are mutually exciusive and \ntheir presence may have prognostic andlor therapeutic implications (3,4). Clinical studies show high EGFR gene copy \nnumber by FISH analysis (amplification) to be associated with favorable clinical benefit (clinical response, stable disease, \ntime to progression, and survival) In patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase \ninhibitors. \nApproximately 3% of lung adenocarcinomas within the Asian population have an interstitial deletion and inversion in \nchromosome 2p resulting in the EML4IALK fusion gene (ALK+) which is sensitive to AlK inhibitors (5,6). The prevalence \nof this abnormality in the Western population is stili unknown, Detection of this abnormality is critical for identifying \npatients eligible for therapies that target ALK enzymatic activity. EML41ALK rearrangements are mutually exclusive with \nKRAS and EGFR mutations. \nFINAL DIAGNOSIS: \nSUMMARY STATEMENT \nThe posterior segmentectomy demonstrates a 2.5 cm poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma associated with \nangiolymphatic and parietal pleural invasion. Metastatic adenocarcinoma is present in posterior and apical segment \nlevel 11, level 10 and level 5 lymph nodes. Surgical resection margins are free of tumor.

C34.2 M8255/3.  \nComment/supplementary remark:   \nThe tumor classification as adenocarcinoma of the lung showing a predominantl y \ntubulopapillary structural pattern still requires confirmation by appropriate \nimmunohistochemical analysis. The classification of the second small tumor focus as a (hematogenous) metastasis that \u2013 despite a certain difference in histoarchitecture and cel l \nmorphology in places \u2013 is based on the structure of the focus, which is lacking the fibrous remodeling or cicatricial zone here that is characteristic of a primary peripheral bronchopulmonary carcinoma. Vascular invasion can be seen in the intratumoral, thick -walled \npulmonary vessels of the larger tumor, where there is tumor spread with endobronchial occlusion in a subsegmental branch of the bronchus. The R1 classification is explained by the observation that the tumor glands invading the pleura extend as far as the outer surface of the pleura in places and the tumor cells thus remain in the pleural space.    Result of immunohistochemical analysis (both tumor foci)  \nCK7 positive throughout, CK20 negative. TTF1.positive (in the smaller focus more than in the larger one), only isolated tumor cells with delicate cell membrane staining for surfactant protein B.  This not only confirms that it is an adenocarcinoma of the lung and, but also supports the view that the smaller focus represents the metastasis of the larger focus  \nseen in 1.) and classified as primary tumor.  \n",

The report describes a tumor in the right upper lobe, which was identified as squamous cell carcinoma, keratinizing type, and moderately differentiated (G2). The stage was determined to be pT2aN0MX based on the size of the tumor (>3 em but <= 5 em), the absence of regional lymph node metastasis, and the inability to assess distant metastasis.

No preoperative tissue diagnosis . \nMACROSCOPIC \nOne specimen submitted. \nThe specimen is labelled 'left upper lobe wedge resection' and consists of a wedge oflung tissue, 130 x \n70 x 30 mm. The specimen bears a line of staples 110 mm in length. Protruding from one aspect of \nthe pleural surface is a palpable mass. The pleura is free and mobile over the mass. 35 mm away from \nthis lesion is a firm pleural plaque, 30 mm in diameter. Elsewhere the pleura shows some irregular \ngrey and white discolouration. Serial slicing reveals a well defined yellowish white tumour mass, 25 \nmm in greatest diameter, approximately 2 mm deep to the pleura. The cut surface shows small areas of \nyellowish necrosis. The tumour is at least 25 mm clear of the stapled surgical margin. No other lesions \nare identified. The uninvolved lung shows severe emphysema. The mass lesion has been sampled for \nMicrobiology and for  [IA-IB tumour with overlying pleura; lC-ID pleural _iir decalcification; IE-IF uninvolved lung parenchyma.] \nMICROSCOPY \nSections reveal a peripherally located moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma demonstrating \npredominantly acinar and focal solid architecture. The tumour is positive for CK7 and TTFI and \nnegative for CK20. Zones of geographic necrosis are evident within the confines of the tumour. The \ntumour does not involve the pleura and is macroscopically clear of the intraparenchyma l stapled \nmargin. No lymphatic or vascular invasion is identified and no perineural permeation by tumour is \nseen.

Part one is labeled 'right middle lobe nodule'. It consists of a\nwedge shaped portion of lung measuring 11 x 5 x 2 cm. There is a\nstaple line identified on the specimen, measuring 10 cm in length.\nThere is a cut identified on the specimen measuring 1.5 cm in\nlength. On further sectioning there is a gray white ill defined area\nmeasuring 1.1 x 1 cm is identified. This area is 0.3 cm from the\nstaple line and 0.4 cm from the pleural surface. The staple line is\ninked blue. Further sectioning of the lung reveals spongy tan maroon\nparenchyma. One portion from the ill defined area is submitted for\nfrozen section analysis. Representative sections are submitted.\n2. Part two is labeled 'station #9 lymph node'. It consists of a\nsingle lymph node measuring 2.4 x 1.5 x 1 cm. The cut surface is\ngrey-black. Entirely submitted in one cassette.\n3. Part three is labeled 'station #10 lymph node'. It consists of\nmultiple irregular fragments of grey-black lymph nodes measuring 1.5\nx 0.8 x 0.5 cm in aggregate. Entirely submitted in one cassette.\n4. Part four is labeled 'completion of right middle lobectomy'. It\nconsists of a lobe of lung measuring 10.5 x 5.5 x 2 cm and weighing\n38 grams. Two staple lines, measuring 8 cm and 6 cm in length are\nnoted. The bronchial and vascular margins are identified. The\nserosal surface is grey-purple and shows a subpleural grey-black\nnodule measuring 0.9 x 0.8 cm. Sectioning reveals an unremarkable red beefy lung parenchyma. The subpleural nodule likely represents\nthe lymph node. No discrete mass lesions are noted. Representative\nsections are submitted.\n5. Part five is labeled 'station #4 lymph node'.

The pathologist whose\nsignature appears below reviewed the original pathology report,\nexamined candidate H&E slides, and selected block 1 A appropriate to\nthe specifications of the ordered molecular analysis. xl H&E and x9\nunstained slides were prepared and forwarded to\nwhere the subject molecular test will be performed. An\naddendum report will be issued when the results.of this molecular\ntest are available.\nAddendum #1performed by\nADDENDUM #2:\nMOLECULAR ONCOLOGY\nKRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS\nReferring Physician\nBody Site :Right middle lobe of lung\nSpecimen Type: Slides\nClinical Data :Adenocarcinoma\nRESULTS: Wild-type gene.\nINTERPRETATION:\nNo mutations were identified at codons 12 and 13 of the KRAS gene.\nCOMMENT:\nMutations in the KRAS gene are reported to be associated with poor prognosis ,and resistance to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor\ntherapies in patients with non -small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). KRAS\nmutations occur in 15-30% of NSCLC patients and are strongly\nassociated with adenocarcinoma and smoking history.\nThis assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;\nbased on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are\nexpected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of\nthe assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low\npercentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated\nfor use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and codon 13 mutations in\nfresh, frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue. In\nparticular the test performance has been established in samples of\ncolorectal cancer and non-small cell lung carcinoma which harbor\nthese mutations, although several other tissues are also known to\nharbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of pancreas, bile duct, ovary,\nappendix, etc.).\nAnalysis of EGFR mutation or gene amplification status may provide\nadditional information regarding this patient's probability of\nresponse to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies, if\nclinically indicated. See references.\nMETHOD/LIMITATION:\nTissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is\nselected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified\nand amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to\nexon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single\nnucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;\nprimer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel\nelectrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or\nnegative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants\nor somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.\nREFERENCES:\nNSCLC\nMascaux C, lannino N, et al.

COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more tumor cellularity is optimal\nfor this mutation analysis. The sample submitted showed 70% tumor\ncellularity upon pathologist review.\nA frequently occurring sequence change 2361>GA (Q787Q) was\nidentified .This polymorphism is known not to have clinical\nsignificance.\nMutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth\nfactor receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with\ndifferential responsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase\ninhibitor (TKI) therapies. The objective response rate among\npatients with a sensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%.\nThis assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain;\nbased on the current literature ,most mutations in non -small-cell\nlung carcinoma (NSCLC) are expected to occur in these exons.\nMutations present in less than 10-20 %of extracted DNA may not be\ndetected by this method .Mutation status in a sample may change\nduring tumor progression or the course of therapy; therefore, this\nresult cannot be used to infer the presence or absence of a mutation\nin another sample or sub-sample obtained from this tumor.\nThis test is validated for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The\nclinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types\nis unknown.\nMETHOD:\nTissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is\nselected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified\nand amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to\nexons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by\nbi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary gel\nelectrophoresis and fluorescence detection.

When a rearrangement involving ALK is\npresent, either inversion or translocation, one of the two fusion\nsignals separates as one red and one green signal. In this\nspecimen, separated signals were present in 0% of the nuclei scored.\nThis result is within the normal limits.\nCOMMENTS: Three to four copies of ALK were observed in 26.0% of\ncells. This gain of intact ALK fusion hybridization signals\nrepresents an aneuploid population with extra copies of chromosome\n2/2p ALK region .Additional copies of ALK are not uncommon in\nNSCLCs, although the significance of extra copies of the ALK gene in\nlung carcinoma is unclear at this time (Salido M. et al.

Fibrinous chronic granulating and fibrosing visceral (sample 1.)) \nand parietal pleuritis (sample 2.)). Uncharacteristic chronic, predominantly interstitial inflammation and fibrosis \nassociated with focal fibrous and small honeycomb-like parenchyma remodeling along the ventrobasalmargin \nof 88.

Left lung submitted fresh for tissue procurement \n             labelled \"left lung\" is an intact lung with two lobes \n    weighing 442 grams.  There is a suture line present at the \n    amputation point of the main left bronchus, the left main pulmonary \n    artery and main left pulmonary vein.  The pleural surface of the \n    lung is intact with a finely stippled anthracotic pigment present. \n    No obvious areas of puckering of the pleura or umbilication are \n    evident.  Several small possible peribronchial lymph nodes are \n    present adjacent to the bronchial stump.  There is a mass that is \n    palpable in the interlobar fissure.  This appears to be below the \n    surface of the lung.  Sections are placed through the mass and this \n    reveals a large tumor mass which is immediately inferior to the main \n    bronchus.  The tumor mass measures maximally 6 x 5 x 4 cm.  It \n    arises approximately 1 cm below the bronchial cuff margin that \n    grossly does not appear to be involved by tumor.  There does appear \n    to be at least one lymph node which is partially involved by tumor \n    adjacent the bronchus.  Portions of the t ormal lung are \n    submitted for procurement per request of   Further \n    sectioning of the lung reveals a second t present deep to \n    the pleural surface of the lower lobe.  This pleural mass as central \n    necrosis and measures maximally 3 x 2 x 1.5 cm.  It has the same \n    fleshy  tan- white gritty cut surface as does the main tumor mass. \n    The upper lobe does not appear to have any discrete nodules.  It is \n    crepitant gray- tan tissue without focal nodularity.  Sections after \n    fixation. \n    BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 - bronchial margin; 2 - vascular margin; 3 - \n    pleural margin of the main dominant tumor mass; 4- 7 - dominant tumor \n    mass; 8-10 - secondary smaller tumor including pleural surface; 11 - \n    random left upper lobe; 12 - random left lower lobe; 13- 14 - \n    bronchial lymph nodes. \n \n     \n \nMICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION \n             Microscopic sections of both lesions present in the left \n             lung have a similar histologic appearance.  Both are \n    moderate to poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas with cells \n    exhibiting prominent eosinophilic cytoplasm.  It is not clear from \n    the histology if this represents two separate primary tumors or an \n    intrapulmonary metastasis from the main lung tumor.  Results of the \n    evaluation of the lung are summarized in the following template: \n \n    Histologic type:  Adenocarcinoma. \n    Histologic grade:  Moderate to poorly differentiated. \n    Primary tumor (pT):  Two lesions are present.  The larger lesion \n    measures 6 x 5 x 4 cm., the smaller lesion 3 x 2 x 1.5 cm. (pT2). \n    Margins of resection:  Bronchial and vascular margins of resection \n    are free of tumor.  Visceral pleural surface free of tumor. \n    Direct extension of tumor:  Absent. \n    Venous (large vessel) invasion:  Negative. \n    Arterial (large vessel) invasion:  Negative. \n    Lymphatic (small vessel) invasion:  Negative. \n    Regional lymph nodes (pN):  Two of six bronchial lymph nodes contain \n    metastatic adenocarcinoma (2/6).  All mediastinal lymph nodes are \n       negative (pN1). \n    Distant metastasis (pM):  Cannot be assessed (pMX). \n \n    5, 3x6, 14x2 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \nDIAGNOSIS \n    A.

Hilar LN (station 10) right: 2.5 em fatty specimen with 2 nodes, 2.5 and 1.2 em, section surface of larger \ngrayish-black and of smaller pale reddish node with 5 mm whitish focus. \n1.) Right middle lobe: inflated, frxed bilobectomy preparation measuring 18 x 16 em, up to 17 em high. Central \nbronchus resection plane located I em proximal to the division into the lobe bronchi. At the hilus two black \nnodes, 1.2 em and 0.9 em in size. Dorsal to the intermediate bronchus a staple suture line runs 7.5 em in a \ncranial direction to the apex of the lower lobe, and a second staple suture line mns 10 em from the hilus along \nthe cranial margin of the middle lobe. Lateral pleura over S4 shows a star-shaped area of retraction measuring \n2.5 em, with a pale brown discoloration in the marginal region, under this a tumor, max. 6.5 em in size, with a \npolycyclic demarcation, obstructing the middle lobe bronchus in the proximal sections and extending to within \n1.5 em of the bronchus resection margin. Spread to the pleura in the area of its retraction, section surfaces pale \nbrown to gray, partly with blackish pigmentation. Mucosa in the region of the ostium of the middle lobe \nbronchus and the adjoining intermediate bronchus extending irregularly to the resection margin. Lung \nparenchyma of remaining middle lobe and lower lobe inconspicuous. \n3.) Bronchial sleeve: 2 em segment of bronchus with 2 em resection margin to the main bronchus (line marked) \nand 1.1 em resection margin tot he upper lobe bronchus. Distal end closed by metal staple suture. \n4.) Upper and middle lobes: two 2 em irregular black nodes or node parts. \n5.) Lobar LN (station 12) right: I em node. \n6.) Hilar LN (station 10) right: 8 mm node with sunounding tissue. \n7.) Pulmonary ligament LN (station 9) right: three node between 0.5 and I em with surrounding tissue \n8.)

Resection margin to main bronchus tangential, resection margin to upper lobe bronchus tangential, cross\u00ad\nsection close to distal resection margin, \n4.)-7.) All material (in 4. -6. halved in each case), \n15 blocks, partly Elastica-van Gieson, PAS, diastase-PAS. \n Microscopy \nRe 1.) Immediate intraoperative evaluation ): metastasis of squamous cell carcinoma. \nAfter paraffin embedding. \nLymph node sections with extensive infiltration by atypical epithelia arranged in differing sizes of partly \nbranched and vaguely epidennoid or concentrically layered solid structures. Moderately wide to wide, pale to \nmoderately eosinophilic cytoplasm. Focally recognizable intercellular bridges. Nuclei round to oval, partly with \nsomewhat inegular contours, mostly moderately, but focally also markedly anisomorphic, with enlarged \nchromatin, differing sizes of nucleoli and numerous mitoses. Surrounding desmoplastic stroma. Small focal \ninclusion of necrosis. \nRe 2.) Immediate intraoperative evaluation ): squamous cell dysplasia up to severity of a squamous \ncell carcinoma in situ with spread to bronchial glands, no evidence of invasive growth rapid sections. \nAfter paraffin embedding. \nTumor made up of atypical epithelia described in 1.). Focal dyskeratoses or vague pearly bead formation. \nIsolated nuclei also deformed. Multifocal necroses of differing extent. Middle lobe bronchus segmentally \nobstructed by the tumor and in large pa1ts destroyed, here continuous infiltration of para bronchial lymph nodes. \nSpread to the visceral pleura, which is markedly enlarged by fibrosis in parts, but not unequivocally infiltrated. \nIn many places invasion of small blood vessels in the tumor and tumor margin. Proximal to the tumor \nobstruction in the middle lobe bronchus and also at the bronchus resection margin partial replacement of the \nrespiratory epithelium by enlarged atypical squamous epithelium extending to the secretory ducts and bronchial \nglands with the squamous disorder mostly reaching well into the upper third or to the surface. Nuclei irregularly \narranged, in most cases slightly to moderately anisomorphic, but with foci of relatively marked anisomorphism, \nand formation here and there of keratin lamellae and pearly beads. Vessel resection margins and hilar lymph \nnodes tumor-free. In S5 incompletely inflated alveolar lung tissue in parts with relatively extensive intraalveolar \nerythrocyte extravasates. \nOtherwise in many places the alveolar lumina and partly also the lumina of bronchioles are occupied with \nmoderately dense macrophages, some transformed into foam cells, some pale brown and with frne granular \nblackish pigmentation. In multifocal parabronchial vessels and in interlobular septa lymph follicles and small \npatches of relatively dense lymphomonocytic infiltrates. In SIO mostly only a few intraalveolar macrophages. \nRe 3.) Immediate intraoperative evaluation (  resection margin to main bronchus + upper lobe \nbronchus in each case tumor-free and free of dysplastic epithelial lesions. \nAfter paraffin embedding: \nBronchial sections with focal replacement of respiratory epithelium by immature squamous epithelium at the \nmargin to the main and upper lobe bronchus. Stroma with increase in elastic fibers. To some extent somewhat \nprominent seromucous glands. Strands of typical hyaline cartilage. Close to the distal resection margin only \nsections of atypical squamous epithelium preserved or registered at the surface as described under 2.), here \nlikewise focal spread in glandular ducts. \nRe 4.) -7.) Lymph nodes with intact basic structure, inconspicuous lymphatic cell content with formation of \nactivated follicles and slight to moderate deposits of blackish granular pigment and some small anisotropic \nparticles within macrophages. \nEVALUATION \nPrimary diagnosis/diagnoses: relatively large, central to peripheral bronchopuhnonary, histologically \nmoderately differentiated, large-cell, slightly keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma of the middle lobe. \nTNM classification pT2 pNJ. VI RO, stage IIB. \nC 34.2 M 8070/3 \nSecondary diagnosis/diagnoses: slight chronic retention pneumonia peripheral to the tumor in S5. Lymph \nnodes with uncharacteristic reactive lesions and anthracotic pigment deposits (samples 2.) and 4.)-7.)). \nRemark/addendum: the tumor shows obliterative segmental growth in the middle lobe bronchus and has \nspread to the mucosal surface right to the central bronchus resection line of sample 2.) and to the distal sections \nof repeat bronchial resection material in sample 3.). The resection margin tot he main and upper lobe bronchus \nof sample 3.) is free of dysplastic epithelial changes. Lymph node metastases are seen in sample 1.) and \nparabronchially in sample 2. ). The other lymph nodes removed and the vessel resection margins of the main \npreparation are tumor-free. An unequivocal infiltration of the visceral pleura cannot be demonstrated. \n",

But in view of the presentation of the tumor and the partial bronchioloalveolar differentiation, the interpretation can be just as easily be supported or perhaps even f avored \nthat this is a primary multifocal tumor manifestation. This would correspond to pT2(m). The stage grouping IIIB thus competes with IIB. The main tumor mass lies in segments 6 and 9 of the resected right lower lobe.

It consists of one grossly identifiable fragment\nof fleshy hemorrhagic tissue consistent with lung. A long black\nsuture which does not designate anything in particular is attached to\nthe specimen. The specimen weighs 66 grams and measures 10 x 6.5 x 4\ncm.A palpable massis identified in the parenchyma. The overlying\npleura is inked with black ink. Serially sectioning the lung reveals\na 2.5 cm tumor massthat is white tan and firm around the edges and\nslightly necrotic and hemorrhagic in the center. Tumor and normal\nlung are collected for the tumor bank and for lab for\nfurther studies. A tied off vessel is grossly identified. This\nvessel is sampled and assumed to be a vascular margin. A long\nparenchymal staple margin is grossly identified in the specimen in the\nshape of a Y. This margin measures 9 cm at its longest aspect and\nthere is also an arm of the staple margin that measures 4.2 cm. The\ntumormass appears to grossly abut the pleura. However, the tumor\nmassis located approximately 1.6 cm from the closest staple margin.\nThis staple margin is shaved and submitted in its entirety. The shave\nsuture margin is submitted in cassettes B-D.Sections are taken of\nthe tumor mass.Sectioning through the remainder of the lung\nparenchyma does not reveal any other mass lesions. Sections of normal\nlung are submitted. Additionally received with the specimen is a small\nfragment of rib. This rib measures 2.1 x 1.4 x 0.3 cm.

Suspected occupational exposure \nto asbestos. \nREPORT ON FINDINGS \nMacroscopy \n1.) Inflated, fixed right lung measuring 12 x 11 em at the base and np to 25 em in length, central bronchus \nresection plane located 1.2 em proximal to the bifurcation of the upper lobe bronchus. Upper pleural fissure \nextensively obliterated in dorsal third, over segment 6 and adjacent sections of S2 an 8.5 x 6 em area of parietal \npleura is extensively adhesive. At the hilus are six partly lesioned mobile grayish-black nodes between 1.1 and \n2 em in size, lower lobe bronchus and proximal sections oflower lobe segmental bronchi largely obstructed by \na central moderately solid, pale brownish, predominantly endobronchial tumor, max. 4.8 em in size, in the lower \nlobe. Involvement of several grayish-black pigmented nodes up to 1.4 em in size by the tumor. Central blood \nvessels partly narrowed by the tumor. Tumor spread across the pleural fissure questionably into the upper lobe. \nSleeve-like spread along the lower lobe bronchus, with apparent involvement of a 2.2 em grayish-black node \nextending right up to the hilar resection surface. Intermediate and peripheral lower lobe bronchial branches are \nmarkedly dilated and filled with thick mucus. Parenchyma in segment 6 below the pleural adhesion is an \nindurated and pale brownish-yellow area of about 3.5 em with unclear demarcation, medial parenchyma in \nsegment 3 and apical parenchyma in segment I rarefied with lacunae or lacuna systems of up to 0.5 em. Pleura \nover segment I shows whitish discoloration in several, partly striated areas of up to 5 em, underlying \nparenchyma here shows an indurated and grayish-white seam about 0.3 em thick. \n2.) Hilar LN (station 10) right: 2.6 em lesioned node or node part, section surfaces predominantly pale brown to \nwhitish suggestive of a tumor. \n3.) Pulmonary ligament LN (station 9) right: two lesioned grayish-black nodes with some surrounding tissue, \n0.3 and 1.2 em in size. \n4.) Paraesophageal LN (station 8) right: five lesioned grayish-black nodes or node parts between 0.3 and 1.2 \nem. \n5.) Snbcarinal LN (station 7): 2 em node part with pale brown to whitish section surfaces suggestive of a tumor. \n6.) Low paratracheal LN (station 4) right: 3.5 em lesioned node with predominantly pale brown to whitish \nsection surfaces suggestive of a tumor. \n7.) Retrotracheal right: 1 em lesioned grayish-black node with some snrronnding tissne. \n8.) High paratracheal LN (station 2) right: five lesioned grayish-brown nodes or node parts between 0.1 and I \nem. \n9.) Hilar LN (station (St.! 0) left: 2.5 em lesioned node or node part, section surfaces pale brown to whitish \nsuggestive of a tumor. \n10.) Low paratracheal LN (station 4) left: 1.5 em five lesioned grayish-brown node with some surrounding \ntissue. \nII.) High paratracheal LN (station 2) left: 1.1 em lesioned grayish-brown node with some sun\u00b7ounding tissue, \nsection surfaces pale brown to whitish . \n Examined: \n1.) Tumor with rest of parenchyma+ proximal branch ofBJO, 2 sections of tumor with lower lobe bronchus+ \ninvolved nodes, 2 sections with pleural fissure to upper lobe (upper lobe portion partly color-marked), 2 \nsections main bronchus at birfurcation of lower lobe bronchus with node close to hilus (hilar resection surface \ncolor-marked), SIO intermediate, S6 at junction of S2, Sl apical, S3 medial, S2 dorsal, central bronchus \nresection plane+ resection margins of vessels, hilar nodes, \n5.), 6.)

All material (in 10. and II. halved in each case), \n23 blocks, partly Elastica-van Gieson, PAS, diastase-PAS, iron staining. \nMicroscopy \nDescription of histological and cytological findings omitted for capacity reasons. \nEVALUATION \nPrimary diagnosis/diagnoses: \nCentral bronchopulmonary, histologically poorly to moderately differentiated, partly keratinizing squamous cell \ncarcinoma of the lower lobe of the right lung with marked lymphogenic metastasization. 1NM classification \naccording to this picture pT2 pN3 VI RO, stage lllB. C 34.3; M 8070/3. G3. \nSecondary diagnosis/diagnoses: \nLargely organized pneumonic infiltrate with fibrous parenchymal remodeling in S6 and old thromboses of \nadjacent small pulmonary arteries. Flat subpleural parenchymal scar in apical Sl with slight perifocal \nemphysema. Circumscribed high-grade emphysematous stromal remodeling with formation of small cysts in \nsegments I and 3. Minimal mixed dust deposits in lung parenchyma and accumulation of alveolar siderophages \nwith possible respiratory bronchiolitis. Pleural fibrosis especially over the fibrous remodeling area in S6 with \nadhesion. Tumor-free lymph nodes with slight to moderate pigment deposits and in some cases reactive \nfollicular hyperplasia. \nRemark/addendum: \nOn the one hand, the carcinoma is spreading to central segmental bronchi of the lower lobe by completely \ninfiltrating and obliterating these, while growing into the lower lobe bronchus. On the other hand, the tumor \nextends to the pleura fissure. The angioinvasion does not affect small arteries and veins in the tumor area. Most \nof the 30 lymph nodes found are infiltrated with metastases, and they are not only detected in the tumor area \nand the hilus region, while the lymph node metastasis the near the main bronchus extends to within 0.5 mm of \nthe mediastinal resection surface, but they are also found in the lymph node areas registered under 2.), 5.), 6.) \nand 8.)-II.).

Submitted fresh for tissue procurement labeled \"left \n             upper lobe\" is a lobe of lung tissue which has been \n    amputated at the level of its principle bronchus and blood vessels. \n    The bronchial profiles that are present consists of three bronchi, \n    each approximately 8 to 9 mm across. They are grossly unremarkable. \n    Some vascular stumps are present at the point of amputation as well. \n    There is some anthracotic tissue present which  may represent some \n    hilar lymph nodes.  The visceral pleural surface of the lobe is \n    intact although there is a small area of adhesion and thickening \n    overlying an obviously large intraparenchymal tumor mass.  The \n    remainder of the parenchyma is anthracotic without focal lesion. \n    The lung was serially sectioned and this reveals a very large tumor \n    mass present in the center of the lobe which has a extensively \n    necrotic center. The tumor mass measures maximally 6 cm. across. \n    There is a rim of granular brown black tumor tissue present which \n    appears to extend to the visceral pleural surface. The center of the \n    tumor is necrotic with a creamy yellowish red appearance.  Fresh \n    tissue from normal lung is submitted for procurement as per \n    request of  Sections through the remainder of the lung \n    show no othe esions.

Overlying the apex and the lateral \naspect of the apex of the lobe is an area of pleural tethering with an underlying tumour \nmass. The remainder of the pleural surface shows no specific abnonnality apart from \nextensive carbon pigmentation. The lobar bronchus has been transected t1ush with the \nhilar soft tissue and has two lumens at this point. Small peribronchial anthracotic \nnodes are noted, none of which appears macroscopically to be involved by a tumour. \nSectioning reveals an apical tumour mass which appears to be bilobed. The combined \nmaximum size of this lesion is 32 mm. The more superior lobule is approximately 20 \nmm in diameter and shows foci of central necrosis. The more lateral and inferior \nlesion is approximately 12 mm in diameter and has a solid cream to tan cut surface. \nIn some areas the lobules appear to be separated by 2 to 3 mm of unremarkable lung \nparenchyma. Both lobules abut the overlying pleura. No other lesions are identified \non serial slicing through the parenchyma. However there is severe emphysema. [1 A, \nbronchial resection margin; 1 B, peribronchial lymph nodes; 1 C-I D longitudinal \nsections through tumour including overlying pleura and both lobules; IE, sections of \ninferolateral solid nodule with overlying pleura; 1 F, uninvolved lung parenchyma.] \n2: The second specimen is labelled 'left hilar lymph node' and consists of three \nts of focally anthracotic and fatty tissue. [BIT,2A.] \nMICROSCOPY \n1: Sections show two adenocarcinomas. The first has a predominantly acinar architecture with a small \namount of surrounding bronchioloalveolar type growth. Ext~nsive blo.od vessel invasion is noted and \nthere is possible lymphatic penneatioll : The other lesion is a papillary adenocarcinoma. The lesions \nare separated by approximately 5 inm by unremarkable lung. A third focus of adenocarcinoma with a \nbronchioloalveolar pattern is present within the random section oflung. This measures 5 mm in \ndiameter. Overlying both tumours, there is scarring of the pleura and features suspicious for invasion. \nSpecial stains will be performed. No perineural permeation is identified. The lesion is well clear of the \nbronchial resection margin. No lymph node metastases are seen. The uninvolved lung shows evidence \nof emphysema. \n2: Sections of the lymph nodes show reactive changes only. There is no evidence of malignancy. \nSUMMARY \n1-2: Left upper lobe and left hilar lymph nodes: \nA: Three foci of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma; 20 mm (acinar), 12 mm (papillary) and 5 \nmm (bronchioloalveolar) in maximal dimension. \nB: Extensive blood vessel invasion; probable lymphatic permeation but no perineural permeation \npresent. \nC: Possible pleural invasion identified; special stains being performed; clear of bronchial margin. \nD: No lymph node metastases. \nE: TINO (awaiting pleural stains) \nF: Non-neop lastic lung: Mild emphysema.  SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT \n1: Tumour invades into the visceral pleura overlying the tumour 'with the acinar architecture . It is not \ndefinitely on the pleural surface. There is no invasion of the visceral pleura by the papillary carcinoma. \nBoth tumours stain positively for CK 7 and TTF 1. CK 20 is negative.

Situated within \nthe upper part of the lobe there is a large mass present medially. The pleural \nsurface overlying this mass appears intact. On sectioning through the lobe this \nmass measures approximately 72 mm in maximum dimension. It has a \nlobulated cream appearance on cut surface and comes to within 1 mm of the \npleural surface. Tumour is present surrounding the segmental bronchus but \ndoes not appear to have eroded through ~he bronchial wall. The endobronchial \nresection margin is clear of tumour. On section ing through the remainder of \nthe lung parenchyma there is anthracosis but no evidence of emphysema and \nno further lesions are identified.

Lung, left upper lobe, wedge resection: - Adenocarcinoma  \n \n \n \n \n \n    ADDENDUM # 1 FOR MOLECULAR TE STS:  \n EGFR, KRAS and ALK (FISH) was sent on 1  for patient \nThe test is to be performed on tissue from case \ndate  The case report, slides, and blocks for the cited accession number were retrieved from archives. Th e pathologist whose \nsignature appears below reviewed the original pathology report, examined candidate H&E slides, and selected block 1C appropriate to  \nthe specifications of the ordered molecular analysis. 1 H& E and 9 unstained slides were prepared and forwarded to where the  \nsubject molecular test will be performed. An addendum report will be issued when the results of this molecular test are available.  \n Addendum #1 performed by \nElectronically signed \n ADDENDUM #2 : \n  EGFR Mutation Analysis \n  \n \n \nReferring Physician:  \n Body Site: Left upper lobe of lung  Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma  \n RESULTS: No mutation detected.  \n INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified in the sample pr ovided \nfor analysis. Fewer than 5% of non- small cell lung carcinoma  \npatients without identifiable mutations are reported to be  \nresponsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies.   COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more tumor cellularity is optimal  \nfor this mutation analysis. The sample submitted showed 80% tumor \ncellularity upon pathologist review.  A frequently occurring sequence change 2361G>A (Q787Q) was identified. This polymorphism is known not to have clinical significance.  \n Mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with  \ndifferential responsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapies. The objective response rate among patients with a sensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%.  This assay analyzes exons 18 -21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain; \nbased on the current literature, most mutations in non- small- cell \nlung carcinoma (NSCLC) are expected to occur in these exons.  \nMutations present in less than 10-20% of extracted DNA may not be detected by this method. Mutation status in a sample may change during tumor progression or the course of therapy; therefore, this result cannot be used to infer the presence or absence of a mutation in another sample or sub-sample obtained from this tumor.  This test is validated for non- small cell lung carcinoma. The  \nclinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types  \nis unknown.  METHOD:  \nTissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tu mor is  \n selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified  \nand amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to \nexons 18-21 of the EGFR gene.

COMMENT:  \nMutations in the KRAS gene are reported to be associated with poor prognosis, and resistance to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies in patients with non -small- cell lung cancer (NSCLC). KRAS  \nmutations occur in 15-30% of NSCLC patients and are strongly associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking history.  This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene; based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is vali dated for \nuse in identifying KRAS codon 12 and codon 13 mutations in fresh, frozen, or formalin -fixed paraffin embedded tissue. In particular \nthe test performance has been established in samples of colorectal  \ncancer and non- small cell lung carcinoma which harbor these \nmutations, although several other tissues are also known to harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix, etc.).  \n Analysis of EGFR mutation or gene amplification status may provide additional information regarding this patient's probability of response to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies, if clinically indicated. See references.  \n  METHOD/LIMITATIONS:  \nTissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is  \nselected for analysis. DNA is isolat ed from the sample, quantified \nand amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single \n nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13; \nprimer extension products ar e analyzed using capillary gel  \nelectrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n This test was developed and its performance characteristics  \ndetermined by The laboratory is regulated under  \nthe Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of (CLIA) as qualified to perform high complexity clinical testing.

Probe #Nuclei Examined % Positive Nuclei % Control values 2p23(ALK)V 100 0 <15.0 A total of 100 cells were scored.  \n FINDINGS: FISH was performed on paraffin embedded tissue sections using dual color break- apart probe to the ALK \ngene at 2p23. This probe flanks the entire gene. If a rearrangement involving ALK is present, inversion or translocation, one of the two probe signals separates as one red (orange) and one green signal. In  \nthis specimen, separated signals were present in 0.5% of the nuclei scored. Based on laboratory validation data, these results are within the normal limits.  \n COMMENTS: Three to four copies of ALK were observed in 27.0% of cells. This gain of intact ALK fusion hybridization signals  \nrepresents an aneuploid population with extra copies of chromosomes 2/2p ALK region.

        "llm_output": " The text appears to be a series of commands or function calls related to a medical report, possibly for a tumor or cancer case. Here are the categories and my justification for each:\n\n1. Site - This is the location in the body where the tumor originated. It's crucial for determining the type of cancer and the appropriate treatment.\n2. Laterality - This refers to the side of the body affected by the tumor, which can be important in certain types of cancer such as breast or lung cancer.\n3. Histology - This is the type of tissue where the tumor originated, such as epithelial, mesenchymal, or lymphoid tissue. It helps determine the type of cancer and the appropriate treatment.\n4. Stage - This is a measure of how far the cancer has spread in the body, which determines the prognosis and treatment options.\n5. Grade - This is a measure of how aggressive the cancer cells look under the microscope, which can help predict the behavior of the tumor.\n6. Behavior - This refers to whether the tumor is benign or malignant, which has implications for treatment and prognosis.\n\nJustification: These categories are commonly used in medical reports for tumors and cancer cases, and they provide essential information for determining the type of cancer, the appropriate treatment, and the prognosis."

Right upper lobe mass\nB.Additional right upper lobe for margins\nGROSS DESCRIPTION-\nA.Received fresh is a 10.5 x 5.5:x 3,5 cm wedge resection of lung. A staple tine indicates the resection margin.\nThe pleural surface, smooth and pale tan-red, shows minimal anthracotic stippling. Located approximately 2 cm\nfrom the staple line is a 1.0x 0.8 cm area of pleural puckering. Beneath the pleura is an ill-circumscribed mass\nmeasuring approximately 2.. 0 x 1.8 x 1.2 cm. The periphery of the mass is. firm and gray, and the center is\ncavitated, No additional masses are identified throughout the remaining parenchyma. Intraoperative touch\npreparations are prepared. A small portion of the mass, as well as normal lung, is obtained for the\nT'iree.sections of the mass with overlying. pleura (inked black) are submitted in Al-A3.\nINTRAOPERATIVE TOUCH PREP DIAGNOSIS: Non-small cell carcinoma.\nB.Received fresh is a 106 gram, 17 x 8.0 x 5.4 cm lobe of lung. The pleura exhibits minimal to moderate\nanthracotic.stippling. Towards the center of the resection is a 9.0 x 5.5 cm defect in the pleura; representing the\nprior wedge resection. The edges of the pleural defect are 1.5 cm or greater from the staple: liner Sections of the\nlung reveal a spongy tan-red parenchyma with no additional masses. Near the bronchial margin (which. is 2.5 cm\nor greater from the staple line) are several small anthracotic Lymph nodes: The bronchial margin is submitted for\nfrozen section in B1, representative sections of lung parenchyma in B2 and $3, and lymph nodes. in B4.\nFROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS: Bronchial margin negative for malignancy .Reported to\nImmu.nohistochemistryr Results\nForrnalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue is utilized.

Remark/addendum: \nThe carcinoma has infiltrated the visceral pleura also in the region of the adhesion site with the co-resected \npiece from the lower lobe of the lung. The resection margin of the bronchus and vessels, the parenchyma of the \nco-resected piece from the lower lobe of the lung and all excised lymph nodes are tumor-free. \nNo asbestos bodies are found in the prepared section planes. But very much further-reaching investigations, \nespecially dust analyses, are needed to determine the asbestos exposure of the lung. ",

Sectioning reveals a cystic like structure with a granular wall  \nthat is 3 x 2 x 1 cm and is does not contain any fluid.   The remaining portion  \nof tissue has a yellow -tan lobulated smooth and glistening cut surface.  \nResidual frozen tissue is  submitted in cassette A1.   Other representative  \nsections are submitted in cassettes A2- 3.  \n Part B is received in a single formalin filled container additionally labeled  \n\"11R\" and consists of a 2.1 x 1.8 x 1.4 cm red- brown irregular portion of soft  \ntissue .  The specimen is serially sectioned and submitted entirely in cassettes  \nB1-2.  \n Part C is received fresh for collection by the Tissue Bank and.   It \nis additionally labeled \"right upper lobe\" and consists of a previously incised  \nlung lobe that is 17 x 7 x  3.5 cm.   There is additionally, another portion of  \nlung tissue in the same container that is 7 x 3 x 0.7 cm, which most likely came  \nfrom the area previously incised on the larger portion.   There is an 8.3 x 3.5 x  \n3.5 cm white- tan irregular, partially necr otic mass where the previous incision  \nhas been made. This lesion abuts the pleural surface in this area and is 2 cm  \nfrom the nearest bronchial and vascular margin. The nearest lung parenchymal  \nmargin is 1.6 cm from the lesion.   Further sectioning of the mass reveals a  \nwhite to yellow -tan, multiloculated, partially hemorrhagic and necrotic mass.  \nThe mass appears to be involving the pleura, but not penetrating completely  \nthrough the pleura.    \n Representative sections are submitted as follows:  \n     C1      br onchial and vascular margins;  \n     C2 -3     mass to include overlying pleura;  \n     C4 -5     mass to include adjacent lung parenchyma;  \n     C6      uninvolved lung parenchyma.  \n Part D is received in a single formalin filled container additionally labeled  \n\"9R; inferior pulmonary ligament\" and consists of a 1.5 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm portion  \nof lymph node with attached fibrous tissue.

Onpalpation there is a firm to hard mass located in the \napical segment, predominantly on the postsromedial aspect. The mass measures approximately 60 x 65 \nx 40 mm in maximum dimension. There is puckering of the overlying pieural surface at the apex. The \npleural surface on the medial aspect of the specimen has a fibrinous-type exudate. On sectioning there \nis a solid lobulated tumour which has a yellow greyish-white cut surface. It, in places, has a villous\u00ad\nlike architecture. There is haemorrhage scattered throughout the tumour. The tumour appears to abut \nthe pleural surface. The tumour appears to lie at least 20 mm from the bronchial resection margin. \nThere is a soft tissue resection margin which has a row of staples and measures 85 mm in length. The \ntumour is well clear of this. The surrounding adjacent uninvolved lung parenchyma has a colhipsed \nappearance.

The findings include removal of a portion of the bronchus, dissection of pulmonary parenchyma along the staple line, and sampling of peribronchial lymph nodes. Some specimens show anthracotic discoloration, which is associated with exposure to coal dust or other environmental pollutants. The procedure also notes a honeycomb appearance in sections of the apical upper lobe, which may suggest interstitial lung disease. However, without microscopic examination and additional clinical information, it is difficult to provide more specific diagnostic information."

C 34.1; M 8070/3; 3. \nSecondary diagnosis/diagnoses: \nTumor necrosis varying in extent with the formation of a lacuna. Chronic resorptive and organizing pneumonia \nin the tumor environment and S3 periphery. Emphysematous stromal remodeling of lung parenchyma with \nformation of small subpleural cysts in the apex. Suspected respiratory bronchiolitis. Pleural adhesion zones and \nchronic fibrosing parietal pleuritis (sample 2.)). Lymph nodes with reactive follicular hyperplasia in some cases \n(e.g. samples 6.), 8.) and 12.)), in some cases sinus enlargement and an overall rather minor anthracotic pigment \ndeposit. \nRemark/addendum: \nThe main tumor mass lies in segments 3 and 2. Since the central segmental bronchi are tumor-free, it appears to \nbe a primarily peripheral carcinoma of the lung, which has invaded the pleura of the pleural fissure and the \nadhesion zone, although at the latter site the tumor manifestation appears confmed to the visceral layer.

Electronically signed\nADDENDUM #1 FOR MOLECULAR TESTS:\nKRAS, EGFR and ALK FISH were sent on\nThe test is to be performed on\nThe case report ,slides, and blocks for the cited\naccession number were retrieved from archives. The pathologist whose\nsignature appears below reviewed the original pathology report,\nexamined candidate H&E slides, and selected block 1 A appropriate to\nthe specifications of the ordered molecular analysis. x 1 H&E and x9\nunstained slides were prepared and forwarded to\nwhere the subject molecular test will be performed. An\naddendum report will be issued when the results of this molecular\ntest are available.\nAddendum # 1 performed by\nADDENDUM #2:\nINTEGRATED ONCOLOGY\nMOLECULAR ONCOLOGY\nKRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS\nReferring Physician:\nBody Site :Right lower lobe of lung\nSpecimen Type: Slides\nClinical Data :Adenocarcinoma\nRESULTS :Wild-type gene.\nINTERPRETATION:\nNo mutations were identified at codons 12 and 13 of the KRAS gene.\nCOMMENT:\nMutations in the KRAS gene are reported to be associated with poor\nprognosis ,and resistance to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor\ntherapies in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). KRAS mutations occur in 15 -30% of non -small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC)\npatients and are strongly associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking\nhistory.\nThis assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;\nbased on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are\nexpected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of\nthe assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low\npercentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated for\nuse in identifying KRAS codon 12 and codon 13 mutations in fresh,\nfrozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue. In particular\nthe test performance has been established in samples of colorectal\ncancer and non-small cell lung carcinoma which harbor these\nmutations, although several other tissues are also known to harbor\nKRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix,\netc.).\nAnalysis of EGFR mutation or gene amplification status may provide\nadditional information regarding this patient's probability of\nresponse to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies, if\nclinically indicated. See references.\nMETHOD/LIMITATIONS:\nTissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is\nselected for analysis .DNA is isolated from the sample ,quantified\nand amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to\nexon 2 of the KRAS gene .PCR products are subjected to single\nnucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;\nprimer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel\nelectrophoresis and fluorescence detection .False positive or\nnegative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants\nor somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.\nREFERENCES:\nNSCLC\nMascaux C ,lannino N ,et al.

The objective response rate among\npatients with a sensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%.\nThis assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain;\nbased on the current literature ,most mutations in non-small-cell\nlung carcinoma (NSCLC) are expected to occur in these exons.\nMutations present in less than 10-20% of extracted DNA may not be\ndetected by this method .Mutation status in a sample may change\nduring tumor progression or the course of the therapy; therefore,\nthis result cannot be used to infer the presence or absence of a\nmutation in another sample or sub -sample obtained from this tumor.\nThis test is validated for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The\nclinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types\nis unknown.\nMETHOD:\nTissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is\nselected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the samples, quantified\nand amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to\nexons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by\nbi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary gel\nelectrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or\nnegative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants\nor somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.\nREFERENCES:\n1.Azzoli CG, et al.

Sectioning reveals a large tumour present predominantly \nin the superior aspect of the lobe which measures 7S x 60 x 60 mm. The tumour has a pink and tan \ncolour and has a soft consistency. The tumour reaches the pleura but no definite invasion through the \npleura is seen grossly. The tumour extensively invades around bronchi and at one point tumour is seen \nto erode through the bronchial wall to form a polypoid mass measuring up to 10 mm within the \nbronchial lumen. This is present approximately 14 mm away from the nearest bronchial resection \nmargin. The tumour appears to come within approximately 2 mm of the hilar resection margin but \ntumour is not seen at a surgical resection margin. Located away from the main tumour within the \ninferomedial aspect of the lung are three separate tumour nodules measuring between S to 12 mm in \ndiameter. An area of fibrosis and calcification measuring up to 3 mm in diameter is also seen within \nthe region of one of the separate tumour nodules in the inferior aspect of the lobe. Lung tissue at the \nsuperio~ aspect of the lobe proximal to the tumour shows yellow discolouration. The lung in the \ninferior aspect of the lobe distal to the tumour appears fairly unremarkable. [I A, bronchial and hilar \nvascular resection margins; IB, vascular resection margin and lymph nodes; I C-l G, tumour with ID \nbeing mediastinal resection margin, I E bronchus with invasion by tumour; I G-lI, separate tumour \ndeposits inferior to the main tumour; lJ, uninvolved lung proximal to tumour; lK, uninvolved lung \ndistal to tumour.] \n2: The second specimen is labelled \"hilar lymph node\" and consists of multiple fragments of grey \ntissue measurin in aggregate approximately 20 x 20 x S mm. [BIT, 2A.] \nMICROSCOPY \nI: Sections show a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. Much of the tumour has the \ncytoarchitectural features of a non-mucinous bronchioloalveolar carcinoma, but unequivocal stromal \ninvasion is present, and an endobronchial component is confirmed. Tumour abuts but does not invade \nthe pleura, and the bronchial and mediastinal resection margins are clear of malignancy. No vascular \nor lymphatic invasion is identified. Peribronchial lymph nodes show no evidence of metastatic \nadenocarcinoma. Several satellite nodules are confirmed in lung parenchyma inferior to the main \ntumour mass. These show the BAC architecture and presumably represent spread through airways. \n2: Sections show fragments of lymph node in which there is no evidence of metastatic \nadenocarcinoll1 ~\\' \nSUMMARY \nRight lower lobectomy: Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with a large component of \nbronchioloalveolar carcinoma, 7S mm in diameter, with adjacent satellite nodules. \nNo pleural, vascular, lymphatic or perineural infiltration present. \nNo lymph node metastases. \nPathological stage T4 NO. \nT-28000 M-81403 PI-03000 \n \n",

Left lower lobe: inflated, fixed left lower lobe measuring 15 x 10 em at the base, up to 19.5 em high, central \nbronchus resection plane located at the level of bifurcation B6 and the bronchus of the lower group. A staple \nsuture line runs from the hilus in a ventral direction for 2.5 em, and a staple snture line runs from the hilus in a \ncranial direction for 3.5 em. Visceral pleura over S6/S!O in the laterodorsal region shows an area of whitish \nthickening and flat protrusion and retraction measuring about 6.5 x 3.5 em. Under this is a fum tumor, max. 5 \nem in size, with a vaguely arcuate configuration and central resorption. Peripheral branches ofB6, B9 and BlO \nleading into the tumor. Parenchyma in the tumor margin area partly compacted and pale. Inclusion of vascular \nbranches in the tumor. Rest of parenchyma largely inconspicuous. \n2.)

All material (in 13.) lamellated) \n17 blocks, partly Elastica-van Gieson, PAS, diastase-PAS \n Microscopy \nRe 1.): Tumor made up of complexes of destructive growth and longer, partly reticulate structures oflarge \natypical epithelia in a multilayered arrangement, repeatedly showing vaguely squamous cell layers, with partly \ncopious eosinophilic or clear, otherwise stained cytoplasm with inclusion of disorganized, anisomorphic nuclei \nof differing sizes, which also show an enlarged chromatin stmcture. Nucleoli always prominent. Intercellular \ngaps and bridges. Isolated small islands of large tumor cells layered rather like onion skins. Occasionally \nintracellular granular, diastase-digestible, PAS-positive particles and at the same time also small lacunae \nsurrounded by tumor cells and containing diastase-resistant, PAS-positive material, with epithelia here at the \nmargin also visible in parts as bronchioloalveolar in nature. Between the tumor cell structures smaller areas of \nnecrosis with partly degraded granulocytes and other cell debris. Then a lacuna formation with abundant \nnecrotic material, here and there remnants of delicate alveolar septa and vessels still visible. Also cholesterol \ncrystal gaps and accumulation of various inflammatory cells. Isolated relatively small vessels in the tumor with \ntumor cell nests in the lumen. In parts there is a transfer of tumor cell structures to original respiratory \nepithelium. In the region of cholesterol crystal gaps is an accumulation of large, mostly foamy macrophages \nalso within the very confined, nonoxygenated subpleural ( n?) that is still present. In \nsome sections, the tumor also extends directly to the pleura, where the pleural elastic fascia is destroyed and \ntranscended by a few tumor cell nests. Above this, the pleura is markedly enlarged in parts by connective tissue, \nand in the region of its surface is an accentuated accumulation of inflammatory cells, proliferation of \nmesenchymal spindle cells and capillary vessels and various inflammatory cells and fibrin plaque. Tumor \ngrowth in a central direction, partially surrounding larger vessels with infiltration and partial destruction of a \nbronchus. Further inflammatory cell infiltrates in the marginal adjacent parenchyma of the lung, where there are \ninterstitial follicular lymphocyte aggregates. Small intraalveolar groups of brown pigmented macrophages. \nOtherwise essentially preserved alveolar stroma. Only circumscribed lymphocyte-rich infiltrates in the region of \nthe peripheral airways and respiratory bronchioles and alveolar duct. No evidence of tumor at the 'resection \nmargins of bronchus and large pulmonary vessels. The stroma of the bronchus shows an increase in elastic \nconnective tissue fibers, as well as some chronic inflammatory cells, in part follicularly compressed aud also \nmanifest in the region of bronchial glands. A few of them are atrophied. In between or alongside are islets of \nfatty tissue. \nRe 2.) -13.) Some lymph nodes-in particular the larger ones-show an increase in secondary follicles with \ninclusion of large and partly active germinal centers. Small patches of anthracotic pigment deposits, \naccumulation oflarge-cell macrophages, in a few cases also small clusters of epithelioid monocytes. Partial \nenlargement of the sinus, with larger monocytoid cells here in places. \nEVALUATION \nPrimary diagnosis/diagnoses: \nLarge, peripheral, bronchopulmonary, histologically predominantly large-cell, slightly to moderately \ndifferentiated, nonkeratinizing squamous cell carcinoma of the left lower lobe of the lung. TNM classification \naccording to this picture pT2 pNO (0/23) VI RO. Stage m. C 34.3; M 8070/3. \nSecondary diagnosis/diagnoses: \nPartial necrotic tumor change with formation of a relatively large resorption lacuna. Tumor-associated active \nchronic, partially resorptive inflammation and also locally confined chronic fibrinous, partly already relatively \nhigh-grade fibrosing pleuritis. Signs suggestive of a slight respiratory bronchiolitis. Chronic bronchitis and \nsmall foci of fatty tissue metaplasia at the bronchus resection margin. Lymph node with slight anthracotic \npigment deposits and to some extent marked reactive follicular hyperplasia. \nRemark/addendum: \nTo a minimal extent the carcinoma has invaded the overlying visceral pleura, which is markedly fibrosed here. \nIn a central direction, the tumor has partially infiltrated and destroyed the bronchi of the basal group, the main \ntumor mass being located in cranial sections of segment 10. Bronchus and vessel resection margins are tumor\u00ad\nfree. \n",

Results reported by \nand repeat-back provided by  \n \nIntra -Operative Consultation #1 performed by \n \nFinal Diagnosis performed by \nsigned \n     ADDENDUM #1 FOR MOLECULAR TESTS:  \n KRAS, EGFR and ALK FISH were sent on  for patient,. The test is to be performed on tissue from case  \nThe case report, slides, and blocks for the cited \naccession number were retrieved from archives. The pathologist whose signature appears below reviewed the original pathology report, examined candidate H&E slides, and selected block 1D appropriate to  \nthe specifications  of the ordered molecular analysis. x1 H&E and x9 \nunstained slides were prepared and forwarded to where the  \nsubject molecular test will be performed. An addendum report will be issued when the results of this molecular test are available.  \n  \nAddendum #1 performed by  \nElectronically signed      \n \n \n \nMOLECULAR ONCOLOGY  \nKRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS  \n Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma  \n RESULTS: Wild type gene.  INTERPRETATION: No mutations w ere identified at codons 12 and 13 of \nthe KRAS gene.  \n COMMENT:  \nMutations in the KRAS gene are reported to be associated with poor prognosis, and resistance to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies in patients with non -small- cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  KRAS  \nmutations occur in 15-30% of NSCLC patients and are strongly associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking history.  This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene; based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of \nthe assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated for  \nuse in identifying KRAS codon 12 and codon 13 mutations in fresh, frozen, or formalin -fixed paraffin embedded tissue. In particular \nthe test performance has been established in samples of colorectal  \ncancer and non- small cell lung carcinoma which harbor these  \nmutations, although several other tissues are also known to harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix, etc.).  \n Analysis of EGFR mutation or gene amplification status may provide additional information regarding this patient's probability of response to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies, if \n clinically indicated. See references.  \n \nMETHOD/LIMITATION:  \nTissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is  \nselected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified  \nand amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to  \nexon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13; primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel  \nelectrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.  \n REFERENCES:  \n \n This test was developed and its performance characteristics  \ndetermined by  The laboratory is  \nregulated under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of \nas qualified to perform high complexity clinical  \ntesting. This particular test is not considered a stand alone test and should be only used in the context of other diagnostic tests or clinical work -up related to treatment decisions.\nis a business unit of  a \nwholly-owned subsidiary of  \n \n Electronically signed by: Date:   \n \n Addendum #2 performed by \n \n ADDENDUM #3:  \n \n \n \n  EGFR Mutation Analysis  \n \n Referring Physician:  \n Body Site: Right upper lobe of lung  Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma  \n RESULTS: No mutation detected.  \n INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified in the sample provided for analysis. Fewer than 5% of non- small cell lung carcinoma  \npatients without identifiable mutations are reported to  be \nresponsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies.   COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more tumor cellularity is optimal  \nfor this mutation analysis. The sample submitted showed 30% tumor cellularity upon pathologist review.  A frequently occurring s equence change 2361G>A (Q787Q) was \nidentified. This polymorphism is known not to have clinical significance.  \n Mutations in the tyrosine domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with differential  \nresponsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapies. The objective response rate among patients with a sensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%.  This assay analyzes exons 18 -21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain; \nbased on the current liter ature, most mutations in non- small- cell \nlung carcinoma (NSCLC) are expected to occur in these exons.  \nMutations present in less than 10-20% of extracted DNA may not be detected by this method. Mutation status in a sample may change during tumor progression or the course of therapy; therefore, this result cannot be used to infer the presence or absence of a mutation in another sample or sub-sample obtained from this tumor. \n  \nThis test is validated for non- small cell lung carcinoma. The  \nclinical significance an d utility of this test in other tumor types  \nis unknown.  METHOD/LIMITATION:  \nTissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is  \nselected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the samples, quantified  \nand amplified by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) using primers to  \nexons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by bi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary gel  \nelectrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or negative results may occur for reasons that include gene tic variants  \nor somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.  \n \n \n   DISCLAIMER:  \nThe test was developed and its performance characteristics  \ndetermined by  The laboratory is  \nregulated under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of \n (CLIA) as qualified to perform high complexity clinical  \ntesting.

Nl metastases. \nMACROSCOPIC \nFour specimens received: \n1: The first specimen is labelled \"left lung\" and consists of a left pneumonectomy specimen which \nmeasures 180 x 150 x 40 mm. Located in the apex of the left lower lobe is a large peripheral tumour \nmeasuring 70 x 65 x 45 mm. There is some puckering of the overlying pleura above the tumour but \ndefinite invasion to the pleura cannot be identified grossly. Many enlarged hilar lymph nodes and \nintraparenchymallymph nodes are identified but none of these show macroscopic evidence of tumour \ninvolvement. Elsewhere the visceral pleura and parenchyma show prominent carbon pigmentation. \nThe visceral pleura at the apex of the left upper lobe shows a cream papule. No other lesions are \nidentified grossly. [1 A, bronchial and pulmonary artery hilar resection margin; 1 B-1 C, bronchial \nlymph node; ID, interlobar lymph node; lE-lG, tumour with overlying pleura; IH-lJ, \nintraparenchymallymph nodes from left lower lobe; lK, intraparenchymallymph nodes from left \nupper lobe; lL, lung away from tumour in left lower lobe; 1M, lung from left upper lobe; IN, further \nsection of tumour and adjacent uninvolved parenchyma.] \n2: The second specimen is labelled \"hilar lymph node No.1\" and consists of a lymph node measuring \n6 mm in diameter. [BIT, 2A.] \n3: The third specimen is labelled \"No.2 hilar lymph node\" and consists of two fragments of nodal \ntissue, the largest measuring approximately 12 mm in diameter. [Bisected, blocked with smaller \nfragment,3A.] \n4: The fourth specimen is labelled \"lymph node No.8\" and consists of two fragments of nodal tissue, \nthe largest measuring approximately 1 0 mm in diameter. The other fragment appears to contain \nmultiple nodes on sectioning. [Each fragment bisected, BIT, 4A-4B.] \nMICROSCOPY \n1: Sections show a moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma which abuts but does not \ninvade the pleura. There are extensive areas of tumour necrosis and several blood vessels within the \ntumour are obliterated but definite vascular invasion is not found. No lymphatic or perineural \ninfiltration is seen. Peribronchial lymph nodes show reactive hyperplasia, anthracosis and a few small \nsilicotic nodules but defmite tumour metastases are not found. However metastatic carcinoma is \npresent within intraparenchymallymph nodes from the left lower lobe (lJ). A single fragment sampled \nas a peribronchial lymph node appears to represent a fragment of the primary tumour (lD). Lung \nparenchyma away from the tumour shows a marked degree of peribronchial and interlobular septal \nanthracosis. There is also upper lobe emphysema and pleural fibrosis. \n2: Sections show a small lymph node in which there is no evidence of malignancy. \n3: Sections show partial replacement of the lymph node by metastatic adenocarcinoma. \n4: Sections show reactive lymph nodes with anthracosis and occasional silicotic nodules. There is no \nevidence of metastatic carcinoma. \nSUMMARY \nLeft pneumonectomy and lymph node sampling : \nModerately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, 70 mm in diameter. \nNo pleural, vascular or perineural infiltration seen. \nMetastases in intraparenchymal and hilar lymph nodes. \nPathological stage T2 Nl. \n",

The pathologist whose  \nsignature appears below reviewed the original pathology report,  \nexamined candidate H&E slides, and selected block 1D appropriate to  \nthe specifications of the ordered molecular analysis. x1 H&E and x9  \nunstained slides were prepared and forwarded to  where the  \nsubject molecular test will be performed. An addendum report will be  \nissued when the results of this molecular test are available.  \n \n  Addendum #1 performed by  \n \n    \nADDENDUM 2:  \n  \n \n \nRESULTS: Positive for a p.G12A (c.35G>T) mutation in codon 12 of  \nthe KRAS gene.  \n \nINTERPRETATION: Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to  \ncorrelate with poor prognosis and resistance to tyrosine kinase \ninhibitor therapies in patients with non- small lung cancer.  \n COMMENT:  \nKRAS mutations occur in 15- 30% of non- small- cell lung cancer (NSCLC)  \npatients and are strongly associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking history.  \n This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;  \nbased on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are  \nexpected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of  \nthe assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low  \npercentage of cells may not be detected.  \n \nThis test is validated for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and  \ncodon 13 mutations in fresh, frozen, or formalin- fixed paraffin \nembedded tissue. In particular the test performance has been  \nestablished in samples of colorectal cancer and non- small cell lung  \ncarcinoma which harbor these mutations, although several other  \ntissues are also known to harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of  \npancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix, etc.).  \n \nMETHOD/L IMITATION: \n \nTissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is  \nselected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified  \nand amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to \nexon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single  \nnucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;  \nprimer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel  \nelectrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or  \nnegative results may occur for reasons that inc lude genetic variants  \nor somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.  \n \nREFERENCES:  \n \n \n  \n \n \nThi\ns test was developed and its performance characteristics  \ndetermined by It has not been cleared or approved by the  \nUS Food and Drug Administration.

The analytical  \nsensitivity of the assay is 10- 20%, thus mutations present in a low  \npercentage of cells may not be detected.  \n Most data published to date pertain to gefitinib (Iressa(r)).  \nSimilar da ta have been seen in studies using erlotinib (Tarceva(r)).  \n Homozygosity for the frequently occurring sequence change 2361 G>A  \nwas identified. The polymorphism is not likely to have clinical  \nsignificance.  \n This test is validated for non- small cell lung carcinoma. The \nclinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types  \nis unknown.  \n \nMETHOD:  \nTissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is  \nselected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the samples, quantified  \nand amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to \nexons 18- 21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by  \nbi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary gel  \nelectrophoresis and fluorescence detection.

The test is to be performed on tissue from cas e  \naccession number were retrieved from archives. The pathologist whose \nsignature appears below reviewed the original pathology report, \nexamined candidate H&E slides, and selected block 1A appropriate to the specifications of the ordered molecular analysis. x1 H&E and x9 unstained slides were prepared and forwarded to  \n where the subject molecular test will be performed. An \naddendum report will be issued when the results of this molecular  \ntest are available.  \n  Addendum #1 performed by \n \nADDENDUM #2:  \n  MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY  \n KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS  \n \n \n RESULTS: Wild -type gene  \n \n INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified at codons 12 and 13 \nof the KRAS gene.  COMMENT:  \nMutations in the KRAS gene are reported to be associated with  poor \nprognosis, and resistance to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies in patients with non -small- cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  \n KRAS mutations occur in 15-30% of NSCLC patients and are strongly associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking history.  This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene; \nbased on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated  \nfor use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and codon 13 mutations in fresh, frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue. In particular the test performance has been established in samples of colorectal cancer and non -small cell lung carcinoma which harbor  \nthese mutations, although several other tissues are also known to harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix, etc.).  Analysis of EGFR mutation or gene ampl ification status may provide  \nadditional information regarding this patient's probability of response to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies, if clinically indicated. See references.  \n METHOD/LIMITATIONS:  \nTissue sections are reviewed by a pathologis t and relevant tumor is  \nselected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified  \nand amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13; primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel  \nelectrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.  \n REFERENCES:  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nG\n \n \n        Addendum #2 performed by \n \nADDENDUM #3:  \n  INTEGRATED ONCOLOGY  \n  EGFR Mutation Analysis  \n \n \n \n Body Site: Left lower lobe of lung  \n \nClinical Data: Adenocarcinoma  \n RESULTS: Positive for the E746_A750del5 mutation in Exon 19.  \n INTERPRETATION: Deletion mutations in exon 19, mostly involving the  \nLREA motif, are reported to correlate with responsiveness to EGFR  \ntyrosine kinase inhibitor in patients with non- small- cell lung  \ncarcinoma.  \n  COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more tumor ce llularity is optimal  \nfor this mutation analysis. The sample submitted showed 80% tumor  \ncellularity upon pathologist review.  \n E746_A750del5 corresponds to 2236_2250del15.  A frequently occurring sequence change 2361G>A (Q787Q) was  \nidentified. This polymorphism is known not to have clinical  \nsignificance.  \n Mutations in the tyrosine domain of the epidermal growth factor  \nreceptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with differential  \nresponsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)  \ntherapies. The objective response rate among patients with a  \nsensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%.  \n This assay analyzes exons 18 -21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain;  \nbased on the current literature, most mutations in non- small- cell \nlung carcinoma (NSCLC ) are expected to occur in these exons.  \nMutations present in less than 10- 20% of extracted DNA may not be  \ndetected by this method. Mutation status in a sample may change  \nduring tumor progression or the course of therapy; therefore, this  \nresult cannot be us ed to infer the presence or absence of a mutation  \nin another sample or sub- sample obtained from this tumor. \n This test is validated for non- small cell lung carcinoma. The  \nclinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types  \nis unknown.  METH OD/LIMITATION:  \nTissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is  \nselected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the samples, quantified  \nand amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to exons 18- 21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by   bi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary gel  \nelectrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or \nnegative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.  \n REFERENCES:  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n  \n \n \n     \n3  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n",

All fragments are submitted in cassette F for frozen section\ndiagnosis. G. Specimen G is designated \"lung, right upper lobe bronchial\nmargin.\" The specimen consists of a 263 gm right lower lobectomy\nmeasuring 14.3 x 10.2 x 6.0 cm. The pleural surface is remarkable for a\nunderlying mass adjacent to the bronchus. The bronchial margin is\nremoved and submitted enface for frozen section diagnosis. The\nremainder of the pleural surface is inked blue. The specimen is\nsectioned revealing an exophytic, tan-white, solid-appearing lesion\nmeasuring 5.0 x 4.9 x 3.9 cm. The lesion is adjacent to the hilum and\n0.1 cm from the bronchial margin. This lesion appears to abut the\nserosal surface, where no serosal extension is noted. Sectioning the\nremainder of the lung parenchyma has a consolidated, tan-red appearance\nwith areas of mucus plugging. No additional mass or lesions are\npresent. Representative tissue was procured for potential future\nstudies. The specimen is sampled in 14 cassettes.\nSummary of Cassettes:\nG1- bronchial margin, en face (frozen section).\nG2 - three potential lymph nodes.\nG3 - single lymph node bisected.\nG4 - vascular margin.\nG5-G7 - tumor closest to dominant airway.\nG8-G11 - additional tumor with adjacent soft tissue.\nG12-G14 - uninvolved lung parenchyma. H. Specimen H is designated \"lymph node station 4 R.\" The\nspecimen consists of three tan-red, spongy-appearing tissue fragments\nranging in size from 2.0 to 0.8 cm in greatest dimension. All fragments\nare submitted intact in two cassettes.\n1.

On sectioning in the central portion of the specimen there\nis an intraparenchymal 1.0 x 0.9 x 0.7 cm lobulated gray tan\nfibrotic nodular lesion noted 0 .4 cm from the nearest staple line\nmargin. This has a gritty gray tan fibrotic cut surface. The\nremaining parenchyma is spongy congested and markedly anthracotic\nstreaked with moderate honeycombing. The specimen is step sectioned\nand entirely submitted in 10 cassettes.\nContainer labeled'4 - level4 lymph node\" are\n1.6 x 1.0 x 0.3 cm of gray brown to black fleshy tissue fragments\nwhich are entirely submitted in a single cassette.\nContainer labeled ' 5 - level 7 lymph node\" are\n4.0 x 2.2 x 1.1 cm partially fragmented lobulated portion of fleshy\ngray black tissue with a slightly mottled fleshy gray black cut\nsurface. This is received along with 1.2 x 0.9 x 0.4 cm of similar\nirregular tissue fragments .The largest portion is sectioned and\nsubmitted labeled A-E while the smaller portion is entirely\nsubmitted labeled F.\nIM\nMicroscopic Description:\nSections of specimen #2 show a large cell malignant neoplasm that in\nareas shows prominent gland formation. These glandular area blend\ninto more solid nests of neoplastic cells. These are supported by a\ndense fibrous stroma and alternate with areas of necrosis. The\nneoplasm extends into the pleural but not onto the pleural surface.\nSections of the neoplasm within the right upper lobe specimen #3\nshow a large cell malignant neoplasm with a distinctly different\ngrowth pattern. In this neoplasm the cells form sheets that have\nirregular borders. The cells have a moderate amount of eosinophilic\ncytoplasm and enlarged pleomorphic nuclei.\nSections of the lymph node specimens show no areas of metastatic\ncarcinoma.\nlmmunohistochemical stains are performed on the neoplasm in the\nright lower lobe specimen and right upper lobe specimen. The right lower lobe specimen shows the neoplasm to be positive for CK7 andnegative for CK20 .Some of the cells are strongly positive for\nTTF1. These are in the more glandular areas .The more solid areasare negative for this marker .The more solid areas do express\npositivity for CDX -2 where the glandular areas tend to be negative\nfor this marker .The cells are negative for p63 .This staining\npattern would support this being an adenocarcinoma of pulmonary\norigin .It is unclear why some of the cells mark with the\ncolorectal marker CDX-2. This same panel performed on the right\nupper lobe specimen show the neoplastic cells to be negative for\nboth CK7 and CK20. The cells are negative for CDX-2 and TTF1. Thecells are strongly positive for p63 .This staining pattern would\nsupport this being a squamous carcinoma that is very poorly\ndifferentiated .The immunohistochemical control slides stain\nappropriately.\nFinal Diagnosis\nRight lung lower lobe wedge biopsy #1 with frozen section:\nNegative for carcinoma.\nAlveolar changes focally with pneumocyte hyperplasia consistent\nwith organizing pneumonia\nand atelectasis.\nFrozen section diagnosis is confirmed.\nLung ,right lower lobe wedge biopsy #2 with frozen section:Tumor characteristics:\nHistologic type :Adenocarcinoma.\nHistologic grade :Poorly differentiated.\nTumor size: 2 .7 x 2.5 x 2.0 cm.\nTumor focality :Single focus of right lower lobe.\nVisceral pleural invasion :Yes (PLI).\nLymphovascular space invasion :Not identified,\nTumor extension :Not identified.\nTreatment effect Not identified.\nSurgical margin status:\nTumor distance from bronchial margin :Not applicable.Tumor distance from stapled margin :0.8 cm.Lymph node status:\nSee specimens four and five.\nLung,right upper lobe, wedge biopsy:\nHistologic type :Poorly differentiated squamous carcinoma (see\nabove comments).\nHistologic grade :Poorly differentiated.\nTumor site :Right upper lobe.\nTumor focality :Right upper lobe, single focus\nTumor size: 1 .0 x 0.9 x 0.7 cm.\nVisceral pleural invasion :Not identified.\nLymphovascular space invasion: No.\nTumor extension: No.\nTreatment effect :Not identified.\nSurgical margin status:\nTumor distance from bronchial margin: Not applicable.\nTumor distance from parenchymal stapled margin :0.4 cm.Tumor distance from pleural surface :0.8 cm (as measured onhistologic sections).\nLymph node status:\nSee specimens four and five.\nLymph node level 4 ,excisional biopsy:\nNegative for tumor (0/1).\nLymph node level 7 ,excisional biopsy:\nNegative for tumor (O/1).\nPathology stage: CommentsThe tumor morphology present in specimen three shows focal areas\nwith morphology compatible with a poorly differentiated\nadenocarcinoma.

Right lung: inflated, fixed right lung measuring 14 x 12 em at the base and up to 26 em high, central \nbronchus resection plane located 1 em upstream of the upper lobe bronchus. Dorsomedial and basal pleura over \nS10 shows an area of max. 7.5 x 4 em with roughening or residual adhesion, in the basal region over S7 is a 3 \nem similar area, Intermediate bronchus in the region of the middle lobe bronchus bifurcation and proximal \nsections of the bronchi of the basal group narrowed by a moderately firm, predominantly pale brownish-white \ntumor with small patches of grayish-black pigmentation, max. 4.7 em in size, with unclear and arcuate \ndemarcation, with the main mass in SIO and adjacent sections ofS6, S7 and S9, extending to within 0.2 em of \nthe medial visceral pleura over SIO. Truncation of B9 and BIO and also a subsegmental branch of B7 in the \ntumor. Focal crossing of lower pleural fissure and infiltration of middle lobe. In the tumor environment some \nsatellite foci up to 0.2 em in size. Peripheral sections of basal bronchial branches dilated and filled with thick \nmucus. Parenchyma below the adhesion zone over SIO shows diffuse induration and a brown vitreous \nappearance. In the mediocaudal region of the upper lobe bronchus bifurcation next to the pulmonary artery a 2.5 \nem node firmly adherent to the vascular wall with predominantly whitish section surfaces and extension right up \nto the hilar resection surface, not continuity wit tumor. At the intermediate bronchus a 0. 7 em node part \nsuggestive of a tumor, next to the lower lobe bronchus part a 0.5 em grayish-black node.

Tumor made up to solid structures of large atypical epithelia, densely packed in parts, with copious, \nmostly stained cytoplasm with the inclusion of isolated very large, otl1erwise often round, occasionally \ndeformed nuclei containing granular chromatin and always prominent nucleoli. Apoptoses, not uncommonly \nseveral mitoses per markedly enlarged visual field (field length 0.61 mm). Occasionally a vague epidermoid \nlayer, often intercellular fissures and isolated visible bridges. No mucin inclusion. In places a dissociation of the \ntumor cell structures. Smaller areas of necrosis. Affected lung parenchyma pmtly destroyed, likewise a \n relatively a large bronchus here, strand of cartilage remaining. A further large bronchus partially infiltrated and \ninvolved in the tumor, likewise in this area smaller bronchi and bronchioles whose lumen is partly dilated, the \noriginal respiratory epithelium replaced by tumor epithelium. In adjacent region tumor cell nests and fonnations \nof small tumor lie freely in alveoli, also tumor cell structures in dilated lymph vessels. Vascularized interlobular \nsepta. between the tumor formations partly loose, partly fiber-rich, collagenous connective tissue with \naccumulation of iuflammatmy cells. Isolated small vessels here, walls thickened by elastosis and containing \ntumor cells. A larger vein surrounded, loose capillary-containing fiber tissue in the lumen. Between peripheral \ntumor margin and visceral pleura on the medial side a strip of free lung parenchyma with partly deficient \natelectasis and thickened alveolar septa. Lower pleural fissure and partly fused visceral pleura demarcating or \ncovering this fissure transcended by tumor, where large bronchi are invaded to within close proximity of the \nmucosa. Large tumor node next to the upper lobe bronchus bifurcation, enclosed anthracotic pigment, tumor \ncell nests here at the resection margin. In the mediastinal tissue a further tumor-compromised lymph node with \nanthracotic pigment deposits and otherwise fibrous growth of connective tissue. In subpleural region of Sl a flat \nremodeling zone of the lung parenchyma with development of collagenous and elastic connective tissue, with \nalveolar stroma still partly recognizable. Nearby tiny radial areas of interstitial fibrosis with small patches of \naccumulated anthracotic pigment. In the basal lower lobe am relatively large area of nonoxygenated, fibrosed \nlung parenchyma with inclusion of partly obliterated smaller, partly patent vessels and bronchioles. Overlying \npleura markedly enlarged and fibrotic. Otherwise here and there in dilated peripheral ainvays mucus and \nleukocytes and also a small cluster of pigment-storing macrophages in the alveoli. At the bronchus resection \nmargin, sections of mucosal epithelium are interrupted, othenvise regular. Here as in the walls of the large \npulmonary vessels no evidence of tumor cells. Lymph node at the hilus with isolated secondary follicles, slight \nplaque of anthracotic pigment and foci oflarge macrophages. \nRe 2.) -b.) Partly preserved lymph nodes with few secondary follicles, varying degrees of anthracotic pigment \ndeposits, accumulation of macrophages and isolated secondary follicles. In parts, lymph nodes are largely \noccupied by solid epithelial tumor. In places, tumor manifestation also in the paranodal tissue. At one point and \nin a larger lymph node only very small areas occupied by tumor cell nests. \nEVALUATION \nPrimary diagnosis/diagnoses: \nCentral bronchopulmonary, histologically largely undifferentiated, large-cell squamous cell carcinoma of the \nright lower lobe of the lung (C4) with overgrowth of the interlobar fissure and continuous growth into the \nadjacent section of the middle lobe and also several in some cases large lymph node metastases. Tumor \nclassification according to this picture pT2 pN3 Ll VI Rl, stage IIIB. C34.3 M8070/3. \nSecondary diagnosis/diagnoses: \nPeripheral bronchiolectasia in the lower lobe, relatively large fibrous cicatricial remodeling zone in S I 0 \nmediobasal and similar flat subpleural cicatricial zones in Sl apical. Local high-grade pleural fibrosis over SlO. \nTwnor-associated inflammation and small tumor necroses. Slight anthracotic pigment deposits in the lung \nparenchyma and relatively marked in some lymph nodes. \nRemark/addendum: \nThe main mass of the carcinoma lies in SJO. Centrally it has grown as far as the bifurcations of the lower lobe \nmain bronchus and the middle lobe bronchus, without these being destroyed or constricted. The tumor invasion \nof small blood vessels only concerns the focal region, the lymphangioinvasion is more marked and is also \nlocated in the vicinity of the tumor focus. The Rl classification is based on the fmding that carcinoma nests in \nthe large involved lymph nodes next to the bifurcation of the upper lobe bronchus extend to the mediastinal \nresection plane. Further lymph node metastases are seen at the intermediate bronchus in the mediastinum and \nalso in the lymph nodes located under 4.) -6.). The pN3 classification is also made with regard to the previous \nfinding with carcinoma cell structures in the fine needle aspiration biopsy from LN4 left (according to clinical \ndata). ",

Most of the pleural surfaces are smooth, glistening \nand light to medium purple-brown. It weighs 2ilO grams. The \nbronchial resection margin portion of the most hilar aspect of the \nspecimen is a bronchus 1.1 x 0.9 em across. This resection margin \nis shaved from the specimen and submitted as a frozen section block. \nTwo nodules are palpated in the upper aspect of the lobe and both \nshow some degree of overlying puckering of the pleural surfaces . \nThese are marked by me with blue dye. The more lateral lesion is \ncut across and reveals a subpleural , Io.'hite and gray speckled lesion \n2.0 x 1.7 cm on cut surface.

The frozen section control confirms the frozen section findings \nof a proximal bronchial resection margin that is negative for tumor. \nThe t\\'10 foci containing gross tumor, the more laterally situated and \nthe more atypically situated have identical histology with areas \nshowing adenocarcinoma growing in scar tissue \\\",ith some areas \nshowing more clear cell patterns to the cytoplasm and other areas \nhaving more eosinophilic and darker cytoplasm . Some of the latter \ntumor grows in a lepidic pattern including focally into the visceral \npleura, with at least one small focus deposited and stuck to the \noutside of the visceral pleura ). Deeper sections have been \nmade of these foci. The section taken between the two nodules, \nalthough not grossly involved, has microscopic involvement of \nadditional invasive adenocarcinoma which therefore shows a \nconnection between these two otherwise apparently separate nodules . \nThus, I think this is a single tumor with a so-called dumbbell shape \nand both foci of tumors making the larger nodules have mixtures of \nclear-type cytoplasm and eosinophilic-type cytoplasm . Emphysema is \nalso found within the lung. \nA focus of tumor shows growth into a thick-walled blood vessel, \nprobably a vein.

Part one is received fresh, labeled 'left upper lobe wedge  \nresection, r/o carcinoma'. It consists of a wedge shaped portion of  \nlung, measuring 9 x 4 x 4 cm. The specimen weighs 36 grams. There is  \na staple line identified on the specimen measuring 9 cm and 3 cm in length. The staple line is inked black and the pleural surface is  \ninked blue. The pleural surface shows dimpling at one area. Serial  \nsectioning of the specimen reveals a gray white firm irregular mass,  \nmeasuring 3.5 x 3.4 x 1.8 cm. The mass is 1 cm away from the s taple  \nline. The mass has a gray white cut surface. The remainder of the  \nlung has tan pink spongy parenchyma. One piece cut from the mass is  \nsubmitted for intraoperative microscopic examination. Representative  \nsections are submitted.  \n 2. Part two is received in formalin, labeled 'station #9 lymph  \nnode'. It consists of a single piece of tan maroon irregular soft  \ntissue, measuring 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm. The specimen is bisected and  \nentirely submitted.  \n 3. Part three is received in formalin, labeled 'station #11 l ymph  \nnode'. It consists of a single piece of tan maroon irregular soft  \ntissue consistent with lymph node, measuring 1.5 x 0.9 x 0.2 cm. The  \nspecimen is bisected and entirely submitted for microscopic  \nexamination.  \n 4. Part four is labeled 'upper lobe completion lobectomy'. It  \nconsists of a lobe of lung measuring 15 x 8 x 4 cm. The specimen \nweighs 169 grams. There are two staple lines identified on the  \nspecimen, measuring 15 cm and 8 cm in length. The staple line is  \ninked black. The bronchus measures 2.5 cm in diameter and the  \nbronchial vessels measures 2.0 cm in diameter. The bronchial  \nvascular margin is shaved. Serial sectioning of the specimen shows  \ntan maroon spongy parenchyma. No definite mass lesion or fibrosis is  \nidentified. Representative sections are submitted for microscopic  \nexamination.  \n \n \n \nSUMMARY OF SECTIONS:  \n1A mass, frozen section control  \n1B-1C mass (entire measurement)  \n1D-1E mass  \n1F stapled margin, entirely submitted 1G tumor, with adjacent to lung parenchyma close to the staple  \nline \n1H normal lung parenchyma 2A single bisected lymph node  \n3A single bisected lymph node  \n 4A bronchial margin of resection  \n4B vascular margin of resection  \n4C three peribronchial lymph nodes  \n4D stapled margins  \n4E-4H random sections from the unremarkable lung parenchyma  \n \nSPECIAL PROCEDURES:  \n \n \n    \n \n    \n \nINTRA - OPERATIVE CONSULTATION:  \n 1. Lung left upper lobe: wedge resection (Frozen Section)  \n- Adenocarcinoma, probably invasive.  \n Result reported by \n \n  \nIntra- Operative Consultation #1 performed by  \n \n \n \n \n ADDENDUM #1 FOR MOLECULAR TESTS:  \n \nKRAS and EGFR were sent on for patient  \n. The test is to be performed on tissue from case \n The case report, slides, and blocks for the \ncited accession number were retrieved from archives. The pathologist  \nwhose signature appears below reviewed the original pathology  \nreport, examined candidate H&E slides, and selected block 1D  \nappropriate to the specifications of the ordered molecular analysis.  \nx9 unstained slides were prepared and forwarded to where the  \nsubject molecular test will be performed. An addendum report will be  \nissued when the results of this molecular test are available.  \n \n  \n  \nAddendum #1 performed by  \n \n \n \nADDENDUM #2:  \n \n  MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY  \n KRAS MUT ATION ANALYSIS  \n \nSpecimen #\nBody Site: Left upper lobe of lung  \nSpecimen Type: Slides  \nClinical Data: Adenocarcinoma  \n RESULTS: Wild -type gene.  \n INTERPRETATION:  \nNo mutations were identified at codons 12 and 13 of the KRAS gene.  \n COMMENT:  \nMutations in the KRAS gene are reported to be associated with poor  \nprognosis, and resistance to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor  \ntherapies in patients with non- small- cell lung cancer (NSCLC). KRAS  \nmutations occur in 15- 30% of NSCLC patients and are strongly \nassociated with adenocarcinoma and smoking history.  \n This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;  \nbased on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are  \nexpected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of  \nthe assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low  \npercentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated  \nfor use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and codon 13 mutations in  \nfresh, frozen, or formalin- fixed paraffin embedded tissue. In  \nparticular the test performance has been established in samples of  \ncolorectal cancer and non- small cell lung carcinoma which harbor  \nthese mutations, although several other tissues are also known to  \nharbor KRAS mutations (e.g.  tumors of pancreas, bile duct, ovary,  \nappendix, etc.).  \n Analysis of EGFR mutation or gene amplification status may provide  \nadditional information regarding this patient's probability of  \n response to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies, if  \nclinical ly indicated. See references.  \n \n \nMETHOD/LIMITATIONS:  \nTissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is  \nselected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified  \nand amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to \nexon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single  \nnucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;  \nprimer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel  \nelectrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or  \nnega tive results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants  \nor somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.  \n \nREFERENCES:  \n \n \n \n \n This test was developed and its performance characteristics  \ndetermined by .

The analytical  \nsensitivity of the assay is 10- 20%, thus mutations present in a low  \npercentage of cells may not be detected.  \n Most data published to date pertain to gefitinib (Iressa(r)).  \nSimilar data have been seen in studies using erlotinib (Tarceva(r)).  \n \nHomozygosity for the frequently occurring sequence change 2361 G>A  \nwas identified. The polymorphism is not likely to have clinical  \nsignificance.  \n \nThis test is validated for non- small cell lung carcinoma.

The pathologist whose\nsignature appears below reviewed the original pathology report,\nexamined candidate H&E slides, and selected block 1 C appropriate to\nthe specifications of the ordered molecular analysis. x 1 H&E and x9\nunstained slides were prepared and forwarded tc\nvhere the subject molecular test will be performed. An\naddendum report will be issued when the results of this molecular\ntest are available.\nAddendum #2 performed by\nADDENDUM 3:\nIntegrated Oncology\nMOLECULAR ONCOLOGY\nKRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS\nRESULTS: Positive for a p.G12C (c.34G> T) mutation in codon 12 of the KRAS gene.\nINTERPRETATION: Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to\ncorrelate with poor prognosis and resistance to tyrosine kinase\ninhibitor therapies in patients with non-small lung cancer.\nCOMMENT:\nKRAS mutations occur in 15-30% of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC)\npatients and are strongly associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking\nhistory.\nThis assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;\nbased on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are\nexpected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of\nthe assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low\npercentage of cells may not be detected.\nThis test is validated for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and\ncodon 13 mutations in fresh, frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin\nembedded tissue. In particular the test performance has been\nestablished in samples of colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung\ncarcinoma which harbor these mutations, although several other\ntissues are also known to harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of\npancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix, etc.).\nMETHOD/LIMITATION:\nTissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is\nselected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified\nand amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to\nexon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single\nnucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;\nprimer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel\nelectrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or\nnegative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants\nor somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.\nREFERENCES:\nNSCLC\nMascaux C, Iannino N, et al.

Lung, left, pneumonectomy (FS) - Bronchial margin, negative for neoplasm\nPage 2 of 5 SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT\nClinical Diagnosis:\nH/O LUNG CANCER\nPage 3 of 5 SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT\nGross Description:\nA. Received in formalin is a specimen labeled \"left lung\". The specimen consists of a lung\nmeasuring 15 x 10 x 7.5 cm, tightly adhered pericardium measuring 10 x 8.5 x 0.5 cm and diaphragm\nmeasuring 4.5 x 2 x 0.2 cm. The specimen weighs 606 grams. The bronchial remnant measures 2.4\ncm in length and 1.4 cm in diameter. The pericardium is inked green, the diaphragm margin is inked\nblack, the mediastinal soft tissue margin and perihilar pleural surface is inked blue. The pleura is\nincomplete on the lateral aspect of the lung on both the upper and lower lobes (orange ink). The\ndiaphragmatic surface of the lung is also incomplete with an open defect showing a visibly necrotic\ncavity within the lower lobe of the lung. No areas of puckering are present along the pleural surface.\nThe specimen is sectioned in a transverse plane to reveal a firm, gray-white mass with central necrosis\nmeasuring 8 x 7 x 6 cm. The necrosis is more prominent in the most inferior aspect of the lung. The\ngreatest dimension of the mass is in the cranial caudal plane. The mass is present from the hilar region\nand extends inferior through the lower lobe to the diaphragmatic aspect. The lung parenchyma adjacent\nto the mass is soft and tan-orange. The upper and lower lobes are firmly adhered at the oblique fissure\nin the area of the mass showing possible involvement in the upper lobe (section A14). The mass does\ninvolve the bronchus and extending within 1.5 cm from the bronchial margin .The mass grossly abuts\nthe diaphragm margin (black inked), the medial pleural surface at the level surrounding the hilum (blue\ninked) and the lateral pleural defect (inked orange). The mass comes within 0.3 cm of the mediastinal\ntissue margin (blue inked) and within 0.5 cm of the pericardial margin ( green inked). The vessels at the\nhilar level appear to be grossly involved. Mucous plugs are identified diffusely throughout the bronchi.\nThe mucous plugs are prominent within the posterior aspect of the upper and lower lobe bronchioles\nranging in size from 0.1 to 0.2 cm. The upper lobe lung parenchyma appears grossly unremarkable and\nis smooth, red and spongy. No intraparenchymal lymph nodes are identified. Peribronchial lymph\nnodes are identified and range in size from 0.3 to 1.3 cm. Perihilar lymph nodes are identified and\nrange in size from 0.9 to 1.6 cm. Representative sections are submitted as follows: A2 - vascular\nshave margin; A3 -A5 - mass in relationship to diaphragm; A6 - mass in relationship to mediastinal soft\ntissue margin; A7 and A8 - mass in relationship to pericardial margin; A9 - mass in relationship to\nbronchus and pleura; A10 through A13 - mass in relationship to pleural margin; A14 - mass at lung\nfissure ;A15 - mass in relationship to hilar vasculature; A16 - mass in relationship to lateral pleural\ndefect; All and Al 8 - additional sections of mass non-marginal; Al 9 and A20 - sections of upper lobe\nposterior aspect with mucus plugs; A21 - section of upper lobe anterior aspect; A22 - section of upper\nlobe middle aspect; A23 - section of apex; A24 - perihilar lymph nodes; A25- A26 - peribronchial lymph\nnodes.\nB.

This\nwhite tan tumor mass approaches the parenchymal margin no closer than\n4.2 cm. Between this nodule and the overlying stapled parenchymal\nmargin-is the area of firmness consistent with bronchopneumonia.\nThere is however one additional smaller nodule that is white tan in\ncolormeasuring 1.0 cm in greatest dimension .This other nodule is\nseparate from the main tumor nodule .This nodule is surrounded by the\nfirm gray tan tissue reminescent of pneumonia .This second nodule\napproaches the stapled parenchymal margin ,no closer than 2 .2 cm.

The tumor focally invades small venous \nvessels. By immunohistochemistry, the tumor stains positive for high \nmolecular weight keratin, CKS/6, and p63, focally positive for CD56, and \nnegative for CK7, CK20, TTF-1, chromogranin, and synaptophysin, \nconsistent with squamous cell carcinoma. Selected slides from the \npatient\u2022 s previous resection  were reviewed for comparison, \nand show a squamous cell carcinoma with extensive keratinization that \nappears morphologically different from the present tumor. While a \ndedifferentiated metastasis cannot be definitively excluded, the present \nlung tumor is therefore favored to represent a second primary squamous \ncell. carcinoma, stage pT2N1. \nGROSS DESCRIPTION \n1. The specimen container labeled with the patient's name and as \"lymph \n\u2022de: ST10L TB angle\". The specimen is received in 10% buffered formalin \n-\u2022ld consists of two irregular pieces of brown-tan, focally hemorrhagic, \nPage: 2 of 4 \n soft to firm tissue ranging in size from 0.8 x 0.3 x 0.3 em up to 2.5 x \n0.6 x 0.4 em. Cross sectioning reveals three probable lymph nodes, the \nlargest measuring 0.7 em in diameter. The cut surface of the lymph nodes \nis homogeneously tan, focally hemorrhagic and firm. The specimen is \nsubmitted in toto as follows: \n1A to 1C -one bisected probable lymph node per block \n2. The specimen container labeled with the patient's name and as \"lymph \nnode: ST11 interlobar\". The specimen is received in 10% buffered formalin \nand consists of two pieces of black to tan, firm tissue; ranging in size \nfrom 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.2 em up to 0.7 x 0.3 x 0.3 em. -, -specimen submitted in toto \n3. The specimen container labeled with the patient's name and as \"lymph \nnode: ST11 interlobar\". The specimen is received in 10% buffered formalin \nand consists of an irregular, brown-tan, firm piece of tissue measuring \n1.7 x 0.6 x 0.5 em. on sectioning, the cut surface is homogeneously tan \nand focally hemorrhagic. \n3A -specimen bisected and submitted in toto. \n4. The specimen container is labeled with the patient's name and as \n\"lungs: LLL with resection margins\". The specimen is received fresh and \nsubsequently placed into 10% buffered formalin. It contains a left lower \nlobe of lung. The overall measurement of the specimen is 17.7 x 11.5 x 6 \nem. The pleural surface appears purple-tan and smooth. one dark purple, \ncongested area is seen within the pleura. Cross sections of this area \nreveal one large, well circumscribed tumour measuring 4 x 4 x 3.7 em. \nCross sections of the tumour appear homogeneously white-tan, friable and \nnecrotic in the\u00b7 centre; tan and firm towards the periphery. The tumour \nis located 0.3 em from the closest pleural surface and approximately 0.8 \nem from the bronchial resection line. However, the tumour is seen \ninvading one of the adjacent bronchi, completely obliterating the \nbronchial wall and invading into the lumen. The tumour is located \napproximately 0.2 em from the resection margin of this bronchus. Further \nsectioning of the lobe shows a homogenously brown-tan parenchyma with \ndilated bronchi, which appear partially calcified. The lumina of the \nbronchi show white/tan gelatinous material within them. Multiple \nprobable lymph nodes are identified, the largest measuring 1.5 em in \ndiameter and is located at the hilar region of the specimen. \n?resentative sections are submitted as follows: \n\u00b7\u00b7\" -frozen section block resubmitted \nPage: 3 of 4 \n acent pleura \n4E to representative sections with pleura and hilum \n(please note that block 4E contains a mirror image of block 4F} \n4H to 4I -bisected representative section of tumour showing invasion \ninto adjacent bronchus \n4J to 4K -representative sections of normal lung \n4L -two probable lobar lymph nodes \n4M -one bisected probable lobar lymph node \n4N -four probable segmental lymph nodes \n40 -one probable subsegmental lymph node \n4P -one bisected probably subsegmental lymph node \nease note that three pieces of tumour and three pieces of normal lung \nnave been taken for tissue banking.

The lung has a  \nweight of 400 grams. There are multiple stapled vascular structures present at  \nthe hilum.   Additionally, there are staple lines within the parenchyma that have  \na total length of 13 cm.   The surgical staple lines are removed and the  \nparenchymal margins are inked blue.   The pleural surface of the specimen is  \ngray-purple to tan- white and generally smooth. The pleural surface has been  \ninked black overlying the area of the mass and a portion of the tissue sent for  \nprecision diagnostic studies.   The specimen is remarkable for a firm tan- white  \nfungating mass within the bronchus of the right upper lobe.   Serial sectioning  \nreveals that the mass has overall dimensions of 6 x 5 x 4 cm.   The cut surfaces  \nof the mass are firm, tan- white and heterogeneous with areas of necrosis and  \nhemorrhage. The mass appears to fill the majority of the right upper bronchus  \nand erode through the wall. It comes to within 0.1 cm of the pleural surface.  \nThe mass comes to within 0.5 cm of the inked parenchymal margin. The remaining  \nuninvolved lung is pink -tan to red- brown and spongy. The bronchial spaces are  \nfilled with gray-green mucoid material. Multiple lymph nodes are present  \nadjacent to the hilar structures.   These range in greatest dimension from 0.5 to \n1.3 cm.  \n Cassettes are submitted as follows:  \n     A1      vascular margin;  \n      A2 -3     mass in right upper bronchus;  \n     A4      mass to nearest parenchymal margin;  \n     A5 -6     remaining parenchymal margin taken en face;  \n     A7      mass to pleura;  \n     A8 -11     additional representative sections of mass;  \n     A12     uninvolved lung;  \n     A13- 15     mult iple lymph nodes submitted in toto;  \n     A16     one lymph node bisected.  \n Part B is additionally labeled \"level 7 subcarinal lymph node.\"   The specimen \nconsists of a gray -tan irregular tissue with dimensions of 3.8 x 3 x 1 cm.   This  \nmay represent a single lymph node or multiple matted lymph nodes. Sectioning  \nreveals multiple tan- white areas of discoloration within the tissue, as well as  \nfocal calcification.   The specimen is serially sectioned and submitted entirely  \nin cassettes B1- B5 following decalcifica tion.  \n Part C is additionally labeled \"upper paratracheal lymph node.\" The specimen consists of a portion of yellow -tan fibrofatty tissue with dimensions of 3.3 x  \n2.3 x 0.6 cm. Multiple probable lymph nodes are identified with greatest  \ndimensions ranging from 0.3 to 0.6 cm. These nodes are submitted in toto in  \ncassette C1.  \n Part D is additionally labeled \"lower paratracheal lymph node.\" The specimen \nconsists of a portion of yellow -tan lobulated fibrofatty tissue with dimensions  \nof 4.2 x 3.1 x 1.5 cm. Palpation and sectioning reveals multiple probable lymph  \nnodes with greatest dimensions ranging from 0.4 to 3 cm. Sectioning of the  \nlargest of these nodes reveals abundant calcification.  \n Cassettes are submitted as follows:  \n     D1 -2     multiple whole probable lymph nodes;  \n     D3 -5     one lymph node submitted entirely, pending decalcification.  \n \nPart E is additionally labeled \"level 10 lymph node.\" The specimen consists of  \ntwo portions of gray -tan fibrofatty tissue with dimensions of 1.6 x 0.7 x 0.3 cm  \nand 1.5 x 1.2 x 0.5 cm. The smaller tissue is submitted in toto in cassette E1.  \nThe larger tissue is bisected and submitted entirely in cassette E2.  \n Part F is additionally labeled \"bronchial margin.\" The specimen is received  \nfresh for frozen section intraoperative consultation.

Two bronchi are present \nat the margin measuring 10 to 12 mm in diameter respectively. Two staple lines are \nalso present radiating from the bronchial margin to the periphery. They measure 35 \nand 80 mm in length. A large lymph node is present adjacent to the bronchial \nresection margin. The cut surface of the lung shows a central lobulated tumour \nmeasuring 39 x 32 x 30 mm. The cut surface has areas of necrosis and carbon \npigment. It appears to overrun several central peribronchial lymph nodes. Numerous \nsmaller non-involved peribronchial lymph nodes are also identified. Tumour \ncompresses one of the main bronchi towards the hilum. It lies approximately 10 mm \nfrom the bronchial margin and appears clear of the soft tissue margin. It is 5 mm \nfrom the nearest pleural surface. The distal lung shows evidence of collapse, \nconsolidation and bronchiectasis. There also areas of parenchymal haemorrhage, \nlikely iatrogenic. Two 1 to 2 mm t~m nodules are seen within the collapsed zone, \ndistal to the tumour. There are also two firm granular areas within the lung \nparenchyma away from the tumour. These range in size from 4 to 5 mm in greatest \ndimension . The residual lung parenchyma shows mild emphysema away from the \nareas of collapse, however this is difficult to assess. [1 A, bronchial resection margin; \n1B-1C, one peribronchial lymph node bisected; 1D-1F, RS tumour and adjacent main \nbronchus; 1 G, RS tumour and closest pleural surface; 1H, peribronchial lymph nodes; \n1 I, RS lung parenchyma distal to tumour; 11, RS two small nodules distal to tumour; \n1K, RS lung parenchyma away from tumour; 1L, two firm granular lesions.] \n2: The specimen is labelled 'number 4 lymph node' and consists of a grey to black \npiece of soft tissue consistent with a node measuring 15 mm in greatest dimension. \nThe node has a black to white cut surface. [Trisected, BIT, 2A.] . \n3: The specimen is labelled 'number 5 right side lymph node' and consists ofa grey \npiece of soft tissue consistent with a lymph node measuring 28 mm in greatest \ndimension. The cut surface contains numerous white nodules. [Trisected, BIT, 3A-\nMICROSCOPIC \n1: Sections show a moderately to poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma \nwhich appears to arise from a segmental bronchus close to the hilum and which \nobliterates several segmental bronchi. Tumour involves peribronchial fat at the hilum \nbut appears clear of the surgical resection margin. The bronchial resection margin \nshows no evidence of squamous metaplasia or dysplasia. Tumour directly invades \nand appears to replace at lease one peribronchial lymph node. A number of silicotic \nnodules are present within other peribronchial lymph nodes. Several foci of vascular \ninvasion are present, including involvement of a major branch of the pulmonary artery \nwhich contains tumour within its lumen. Definite lymphatic or perineural invasion is \nnot identified. Distant lung parenchyma contains dust macules and fibromuscular  scars and shows severe emphysema. There are also vascular changes in keeping with \norganised thrombi distal to the tumour. \n2 & 3: Sections show anthracotic lymph nodes containing a few small silicotic \nnodules but no evidence of metastatic carcinoma. \nSUMMARY \nRight upper lobectomy, no. 4 and no. 5 lymph nodes: \nSquamous cell carcinoma, 39 mm in diameter. \nVascular invasion present. \nNo pleural, lymphatic or perineural invasion identified . \nDirect invasion of peribronchial lymph node. \nPathological stage T2a N 1. \nT-28000 M-80703 PI-03000 \ncc: Lung Cancer Registry ",

        "llm_output": " Report: \nThe patient is a 62-year-old male who presented with a right upper lobe lung mass. A CT-guided core biopsy was performed. Histologically, the tumor consists of crowded, atypical cells arranged in solid nests and cords, with focal necrosis and a high mitotic rate (>10/high power field). Immunohistochemical stains show the tumor to be positive for TTF-1 and CK7, consistent with a primary lung adenocarcinoma. The tumor involves the visceral pleura but does not invade the chest wall or diaphragm (T2). No hilar or mediastinal lymph node metastases are identified (N0). There is no evidence of distant metastasis (M0). Based on these findings, the tumor is staged as T2N0M0. The grade of differentiation cannot be assessed due to the absence of architectural features in this limited sample; however, the high mitotic rate suggests a high-grade tumor (Grade III).\n\n1. \"Site\": lung.

Collection Date: \nE. EML41ALK rearrangement NOT identified (see In Situ Procedure). \nNote: \nKRAS codon 12/13 mutations are found in approximately 10-30% lung adenocarcinomas and associated with history of \nsmoking. The presence of KRAS mutation leads to resistance to EGFR tiir eted therapies (1). EGFR exon 19 and 21 \nmutations are present In about 10% of~nd up to 40% In the opulatlon, COmmon in _and \nassociated with the clinical response to treatment with EGFR Inhibitors 2). These mutations are mutually exclusive and \ntheir presence may have prognostic andlor therapeutic Implications (3,4). Clinical studies show high EGFR gene copy \nnumber by FISH analYSis (amplification) to be associated with favorable clinical benefit (clinical response, stable disease, \ntime to progression, and survival) In patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase \ninhibitors, \nApproximately 3% of lung adenocarcinomas within the Asian population have an interslltlal deletion and inversion in \nchromosome 2p resulting in the EML4IALK fusion gene (ALK+) which is sensitive to ALK inhibitors (5,6). The prevalence \nof this abnormality in the Western population is still unknown. Detection of this abnormality is critical for identifying \npatients eligible for therapies that target ALK enzymatic activity. EML41ALK rearrangements are mutually exclusive with \nKRAS and EGFR mutations. \nFINAL DIAGNOSIS: \nSummary Statement \nThe right upper lobectomy and superior segmentectomy of the right lower lobe reveals a 2.4 em poorly differentiated \nmucin-producing adenocarcinoma of the right upper lobe, 2.4 em in diameter, associated with angiolymphatic and \nvisceral pleural invasion with involvement of the right paratracheallymph nodes, with all margins free.

In \nsome areas, psammoma bodies are Identified, and in still other areas zones of solid growth are prominent. In several \nareas, focal squamous differentiation Is seen, however, this comprises only a small percentage of the overall tumor \n\u00ab10%) and therefore, we have chosen not to classify this as an adenosquamous carcinoma. \n CASE SYNOPSIS: \nSYNOPTIC DATA:\u00b7 PRIMARY l.UNG TUMORS \nTUMOR l.OCATION: Right Vpper Lobe \nLUNG SEGMENT(S) INVOLVED: Basilar \nPROCEDURE: Lobectomy \nTUMOR SIZE: Maximum dimension: 2.4 cm \nMinor dimension: 1.6 cm \nGROSS SATELLITES: Number of gross satellite lesions: 0 \nTUMOR TYPE: Invasive adenocarcinoma \nHISTOLOGIC GRADE: G3, Poorly differentiated \nMICROSCOPIC SATELLITES: Number of microscopic satellite lesions: 0 \nEXTRAPULMONARY PARENCHYMAL \nEXTENSIONIINVASION OF TUMOR: Visceral pleura \nANGIOLYMPHATIC INVASION: Yes \nTUMOR NECROSIS: < or = to 50% \nSURGICAL MARGIN INVOLVEMENT: No \nSURGICAL MARGIN SITE: Distance of invasive tumor to closest margin: 8.0 mm.

Peribronchial lower lobe bronchus: 0.3 em pale section. \n2.) Inflated, fixed right lower lobe measuring 16 x 12 em at the base and up to 18.5 em in length, central \nbronchus resection line located at the bifurcation of B6. Staple suture lines measuring 4.5 and 3.5 em, \nrespectively, run from the hilus to the cranial and the ventrocaudal regions. At the hilus two mobile Iesioned \ngrayish-black nodes, 0.6 and 0.8 em in size. Moderately solid pale brownish-white tumor max. 3.8 em in size \nwith unclear demarcation and patchy blackish pigmentation located in the central region at the bifurcation of \nB8. Narrowing of B8 and its proximal subsegmental branches. Involvement of some blackish pigmented nodes \nup to I .2 em in size by the tumor, one of these at the hilus. Tumor distance from hilar resection surface at least \n0. I em, extends right up to the peripheral pleura. Sleeve-like tumor spread along smaller bronchial branches. \nPeripheral bronchi in segment 8 dilated and filled with thick mucus. Parenchyma in tumor environment \ndiffusely indurated in places and of brownish-yellow color. Rest of parenchyma, pleura and prepared bronchial \npathways inconspicuous. \n1.) Lobar LN (Item 12) middle lobe: 1.2 em lesioned grayish-black node or node part. \n2.) Lobar LN (Item 12) middle lobe: 1.3 em Iesioned grayish-black node or node part. \n3.) Hilar LN (Item 10) right: 2.5 em Iesioned grayish-black node. \n4.) Subcarinal LN (Item 7): two Iesioned grayish-black nodes with some surrounding tissue, 0.6 and 3 em in \nsize, the larger one strand-shaped. \nExamined: \n1.) Rapid section residual material, \n2.) Tumor with rest of parenchyma, with subsegmental branches of B8 and involved nodes, tumor margin area with \nsleeve-like spread, hilar resection surface (color marking), 2 sections with peripheral pleura + hilar nodes, central \nbronchus resection line+ resection margins vessels, mobile hilar nodes, \n3.)

Immediate intraoperative evaluation : mainly vessel, marginal very small LN section without \ntumor. \n3.) Immediate intraoperative evaluation ): LN with no carcinoma. \nDescription of histological and cytological findings omitted for capacity reasons. \n EVAlUATION \nPrimary diagnosis/diagnoses \nBronchopulmonary, histologically large-cell solid carcinoma without mucin formation extending from central to \nperipheral areas in the region of the mediastinal pleura. Tumor classification according to this picture pT2 pNl Vl RO, \nstage liB. C343 M8012/3 or 8070/3. \nSecondary diagnosis/diagnoses \nTumor necrosis. Marked, largely interstitial chronic and predominantly Iymphofollicular inflammation in the \narea of the tumor margin with atypical adenomatous alveolar hyperplasia. Chronic sclerotic peribronchitis of \ndownstream subsegmental bronchi and active chronic peripheral bronchitis in S8. Tumor-free lymph nodes with \nmoderate anthracotic pigment deposit and reactive follicular hyperplasia. \nRemark/addendum \nThe carcinoma lies in 58; it probably developed centrally with partial infiltration and destruction of B8. Medium-sized \npulmonary arteries are infiltrated by the tumor, focally destroyed and obliterated; there is also a focal tumor infiltration \nof the outer wall of the main branch of the pulmonary artery to the lower lobe. The resection margins of the large \npulmonary vessels and the bronchus resection line are tumor-free. The lymph node metastases lie in the region of the \nprimary tumor and the hilar region. Since histological examination occasionally shows vaguely suggestive differentiation \nor structural features of squamous cell carcinoma, it could also be an undifferentiated squamous cell carcinoma \n(immunohistochemical cytokeratin analysis follows). \nMaterial examined: \nRight lower lobe \n1. Additional report \nImmunohistochemical studies \nThe marker profile established (positive for CK7 and to some extent high molecular weight keratins, negative for TTF-1) \nis consistent with (undifferentiated) squamous cell carcinoma.

For decalcification.  \n \nPart D is additionally labeled \"R13 lymph node\" and is a specimen consisting of \na single tan to brown apparent lymph node, measuring 1 x 0.7 x 0.3 cm. The specimen is submitted entirely in ca ssette D1 for de calcification.  \n \nPart E is additionally labeled \"right upper lobe\" and is a specimen consisting \nof two cassettes labeled FSE1 and FSE2. Within cassette FSE1 is a fragment of \ntan to brown apparent lung parenchyma measuring 2.2 x 1.9 x 0.2 cm. The specimen is resubmitted in cassette E1 for permanent sections. Within cassette FSE2 is a \nsingle tan to brown fragment of apparent lung measuring 2.7 x 1.3 x 0.2 cm. The \nspecimen is resubmitted in cassette E2 for permanent sectioning. Also within the \ncontainer is a purple to dark brown appa rent right upper lobe measuring 17.5 x \n10 x 5.5 cm. The specimen has been previously incised at the time of frozen sectioning. The bronchial margin and vascular margins are stapled shut. The \npleural surface of the lung is smooth and glistening. Serial sectioning of the \nlung reveals two to three tan-white infiltrative appearing lesions.  The mass \nthat was designated as the smaller lesion (FSE1) at the time of frozen \nsectioning, measures 3.5 x 2.5 x 2.1 cm. It abuts the pleural surface and comes \nto within 2 cm of the bronchial and vascular margins. The mass that was \ndesignated as the larger lesion at the time of frozen sectioning (FSE2), \nmeasures 2.5 x 3 x 2 cm. This mass abuts the pleural surface and comes to within \n3 cm of the bronchial and vascular margins. Therefore the mass that was  initially described as the smaller lesion at the time of frozen sectioning was \nfound to be the larger of the two masses. The uninvolved parenchyma is red and \nspongy with no discrete lesions.   \n \nThe specimen is submitted as follows:  \n     E3     bronchial margin;       E4     vascular margin;  \n     E5-7     3.5 cm mass to nearest pleural surface;  \n     E8     3.5 cm mass to  adjacent grossly normal lung;  \n     E9-11     2,5 cm mass to nearest pleural surface;       E12     2.5 cm mass to adjacent grossly normal lung;       E13     representativ e section of uninvolved lung;  \n     E14     multiple possible lymph nodes in toto.   \nPart F is additionally labeled \"level 7 lymph node\" and is a specimen consisting \nof three tan to brown firm fragments of ti ssue, ranging in size from 0.3 to 0.7 \ncm. The specimen is submitted in entirely in cassette F1 for decalcification.  \n Part G additionally labeled \"2R lymph node\" and is a specimen consisting of \nthree fragments of purple to white irregular soft tissue, ranging in size from \n0.4 to 2.2 cm.    \nThe specimen is submitted as follows:  \n     G1     two smaller fragments submitted in toto;  \n     G2     the larger fragment bisected.

Submitted fresh labelled \"right upper lobe.\"  It  \n             consists of a lobe of lung tissue submitted for tissue  \n    procurement.  Lobe has a large perihilar lymph node present which  \n    appears to have encased the bronchus at the point  of resection.  \n    This node, on cut section is 2.5 cm in greatest extent and has a  \n    mottled tan and black cut surface.  There is an area of pleural  \n    thickening and puckering on the apical portion of the lobectomy.  \n    Serial sections taken through the lung reveal a large discrete  \n    circumscribed tumor in the apex measuring 2.3 x 1.9 x 1.5 cm.  It \n    too has a granular tan and black cut surface appearance and is  \n    sharply demarcated from the surrounding lung. It approaches the  \n    visceral pleural surface but does not appear to involve it.  \n    Adjacent to tumor there is an area of discoloration and thickening  \n    of the lung parenchyma as well as some apparent emphysematous  \n    changes in the more distal parenchyma.

Submitted fresh for frozen section labelled \"level 7              lymph node\" is a 2.5 cm aggregate of anthracotic soft     tissue submitted entirely for frozen section.  \n     \n MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION  \n             Microscopic sections of the lung carcinoma reveals a poorly     differentiated non -small cell carcinoma.  The tumor is growing in  \n    discrete  nodules and packets filling the air space s with somewhat  \n    columnar cells with a peripheral picket -fence -like pattern of  \n    growth.  Individual cells are hyperchromatic with frequent mitotic  \n    activity.  The tumor is negative for mucicarmine.  It does show     strong positivity for TTF -1 and  CEA and is negative for P63.  This  \n  \n \nindicates that it is a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.  \n    Results of the resection are summarized in the following template.  \n \n    Histologic type:  Adenocarcinoma.  \n    Histologic  grade:  Poorly differentiated. \n    Primary tumor (pT):  Tumor is 2.3 cm in size and not involve the  \n    visceral pleural surface (pT1b).  \n    Margins of resection:  Negative.  \n    Direct extension of tumor:  Absent.  \n    Venous (large vessel) invasion:  Present.  \n    Arterial (large vessel) invasion:  Negative.  \n    Lymphatic (small vessel) invasion:  Small vessel invasion present.  \n    Regional lymph nodes (pN):  1 of 2 hilar lymph nodes contains  \n    metastatic carcinoma.  All sampled mediastinal lymph nodes are \n                                negative for tumor (pN1).     Distant metastasis (pM):  pMX.  \n    Other findings:  Focal infarction distal to the tumor.  \n    Emphysematous changes.  \n       \n D\nIAGNOSIS \n    A. Lung, right upper lobectomy:  \n         Invasive poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.  \n         Tumor is confined to the lung and does not involve the visceral  \n         pleural surface.  \n         One of two peribr onchial lymph nodes is positive for metastatic  \n         carcinoma (1/2).  \n         Large venous vessel and lymphatic vessel invasion by tumor is \n         present.

The larger fragment measures 0.9 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm and the smaller fragment measures 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm. Microscopic description: The tumor is composed of cells arranged in cords and nests, with focal comedo necrosis. The tumor cells have high nucleus to cytoplasm ratio, vesicular chromatin, and conspicuous nucleoli. Mitotic figures are easily identified. Immunohistochemical stains show the tumor cells to be positive for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2 neu. The background shows extensive lymphocytic infiltration. No ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or invasive carcinoma is identified in the surrounding breast tissue.\n\n1. \"Site\": left breast.

Part one is received in saline, labeled 'level 9 lymph node'. It  \nconsists of two irregular fragments of tan soft tissue measuring 0.8  \nx 0.5 x 0.2 cm and 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm. Entirely submitted in one  \ncassette.  \n 2. Part two is received fresh, labeled 'right upper lobectomy'. It  \nconsists of a  portion of right upper lobe of lung, measuring 15.6 x  \n3.8 cm. The staple line measures 15.5 cm. The staple line is shaved  \nand the pleura around the staple line is inked in green. The pleural  \nsurface is pink tan glistening and reveals a thickened, bossellated  \narea with fibrous thickening. The bronchial margin measures 1.5 cm  \nand the vascular margin 1.2 cm. Beneath the thickened pleura there  \nis a firm gray area, measuring 1.5 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm, located 4.5 cm  \nfrom the staple line margin. Also noted a second separate firm gray  \nwhite area, measuring 1.5 cm in greatest dimension which upon  \npressure exudes cheesy material. This mass is located 1 cm from the staple line margin, also multiple anthracotic lymph nodes, ranging  \nfrom 0.2 cm to 0.5 cm identified from the hilar area. Representative  \nsections are submitted.  \n 3. Part three is received in saline, labeled 'level 7 lymph node'.  \nIt consists of three irregular fragments of tan soft tissue \nmeasuring 1.5 x 0.7 x 0.3 cm, 1.5 x 1 x 0.2 cm and 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.2  \ncm. Entirel y submitted in two cassettes.  \n \n4. Part four is received in saline, labeled 'level 4 lymph node'.  \nIt consists of a 0.7 x 0.4 x 0.1 cm irregular portion of tan soft  \ntissue. Entirely submitted in one cassette.  \n  \n5. Part five is received in saline, labeled 'additional right upper  \nlobe margin'. It consists of a 6.5 x 4.5 x 2.5 cm triangular -shaped  \nwedge of lung tissue, with a 6.5 cm long stapled line along one  \nedge, and two stapled lines along an adjacent edge measuring 3 cm  \nand 4 cm respectively. The specimen is  photographed. The 6.5 cm  \nlong stapled edge is inked black; the 3 cm long stapled edge  \n(adjacent to the 6.5cm long one) is inked blue; and the 4 cm long \nstapled edge is inked green. The black and blue inked stapled lines  \nare at acute angles.

The analytical sensitivity of  \nthe assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low  \npercentage of cells may not be detected.  \n \nThis test is validated for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and  \ncodon 13 mutations in fresh, frozen, or formalin- fixed paraffin \nembedded tissue. In particular the test performance has been  \nestablished in samples of colorectal cancer and non- small cell lu ng \ncarcinoma which harbor these mutations, although several other  \ntissues are also known to harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of  \npancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix, etc.).  \n \nMETHOD/LIMITATION:  \nTissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is  \nselected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified  \nand amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to \nexon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single  \nnucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;  \nprimer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel  \nelectrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or  \nnegative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants  \nor somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.  \n \nREFERENCES:  \n \n \n \n \nThis test was developed and its performance characteristics  \ndetermined by It has not been cleared or approved by the  \nUS Food and Drug Administration.

On the costal side, deformed parietal \npleura containing adipose tissue. In the apical section of S 1 there is a tumorous node measuring 65 mm, \ngrayish-white, containing significant anthracotic pigment, with a well demarcated border and polycyclic \ndemarcation, extending up to and under the adhered pleura. The bronchia are free of tumors in their central \nbranches and are unremarkable. The right middle puhnonary lobe is also unremarkable. No larger lymph nodes \nare detectable either in the hilar or peribronchial areas. \n2. L 4: Torn lymph node tissue with anthracotic pigment, measuring around 10 mm. \n3. L 10: Nodule measuring 3 mm with blackish pigment. \n4. L 7: segmented lymph adipose tissue, with partial black pigmentation, measuring approx 20 mm when \nspread out flat. \n5.

(HE, b: PAS, b -e: EvG) No signs of tumor in the resection margin of the bronchia or the adipose \nconnective tissue and blood vessels by it. In the peribronchial area there is a small tumor-free lymph node with \nanthracotic pigment. The described tumor is made up of bands of an immature, squamous cell carcinoma with \ndistinct pleomorphism and chromatin coarsening of the core as well as frequent mitosis and multi focal necrotic \ninclusions. Infiltration of the visceral pleura, penetrating the adjoining adhesion area, however the clearly \ndefmable parietal pleura and the adjoining, adhered, subpleural adipose connective tissue have no further \ntumorous branches. Significant indication of angioinvasion in the centre of the tumor with formation of \nobliterative tumor thrombi. \n2.

Two lobes of lung are grossly recognizable and are the\nmiddle and lower lobes respectively. There is a tumor palpable in\nthe lower lobe measuring approximately 6.5 x 5.0 x 4.5 cm. The\npleural surface is red-purple and smooth without noted areas of\npuckering. The surface is also notable for two staple lines; a 6.0 cm\nstaple line in the middle lobe which is approximately 5.0 cm from the\nnearest palpable massand a 9.0 cm staple line adjacent to the tumor.\nThe staple lines are removed and the underlying lung parenchyma is\ninked orange. The bronchial and vascular margins are shaved. The\nbronchi are notable for white-tan tumor in the lumen of the bronchi.\nThe tumor appears grossly at the shaved bronchial margin. The lung is\nserially sectioned to reveal a large multinodular and confluent\nwhite-tan solid and partially necrotic tumor. This large tumor\ngrossly involves the central and peripheral aspects of the lung lobe.\nThe tumor grossly approaches the pleural margin and is less than 1.0\nmm grossly from the nearest pleural surface. The nearest staple line\nis also closely involved by tumor and is grossly 3.0 mm from the\nnearest stapled margin. One representative section of tumor adjacent\nto the nearest staple margin and one representative section of the\nbronchial margin are submitted for frozen section. Representative\nsections of the tumor next to the nearest pleural surfacr and next to\n(Continued on next page.) Page 7\nthe nearest bronchi are submitted. The entire staple lines are\nsubmitted. The hilum reveals three possible lymph nodes ranging in\nsize from 0.3 to 0.8 cm in greatest dimension.

The smaller (pTlb) is a squamous cell carcinoma confined\nto the parenchyma with negative pleura and margins of resection. The\nlarger tumor (pT2b) is a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma which\nspares the pleura but is identified at the parenchymal margin once the\nstaple line was trimmed away.\nMultiple calcified hyalinized granulomata also present. 4 additional\nlymph nodes negative for metastatic disease. Marked fibro-inflammatory\nreaction beyond the tumor and adherent to 2 ribs.\nM.AVF node, biopsy: Benign lung tissue with single calcified\nhyalinized granuloma.\nN.4R, biopsy: Benign lymphoid tissue with anthracosis\n0.Level 9, biopsy: Benign lymphoid tissue with anthracosis\nP.level 7, biopsy: Benign lymphoid tissue with anthracosis.\nMicroscopic Description:\nMicroscopic examination performed. All lymphoid tissue submitted is\nnegative for metastatic disease but discloses significant anthracosis.\nScattered hyalinized and calcified granulomata are noted in parts F.,\nL.and M which on H&E stain suggested the possibility of fungal\norganisms. However, GMS stain for fungus was performed on part F.,\nblocks L 9-11 and M and were all negative. No definite fungal\norganisms, therefore, are identified. The stain for acid-fast bacilli\nthese blocks is negative. The right upper lobe specimen, part L, discloses two separate\ncarcinomas. The smaller one (2.5 cm) is a squamous cell carcinoma with\ninvolvement of a nearby bronchus which also contains squamous cell\ncarcinoma in situ. This tumor has focal keratinization and necrosis,\nsparing the pleura 1.5 cm away from this tumor is a 6.5 cm cavitating\nmoderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. There is no apparent\ncommunication or commingling of these tumor types. The periphery of\nthe invasive adenocarcinoma discloses bronchoalveolar architecture.\nThe 2 densely adherent ribs overlie the vicinity of the adenocarcinoma.\nThe adenocarcinoma appears confined to the pulmonary parenchyma.\nDistal to the adenocarcinoma there is a marked fibro-inflammatory\nresponse (containing occasional giant cells) which replaces the pleura\nand extends to the surface of the ribs. There is no actual tumor in\nthis thick fibro-inflammatory layer and the ribs are negative for\ntumor. Bronchial and vascular margins of resection are negative for\ntumor. However, the staple line was trimmed away and the remaining\nparenchymal surface painted with ink. Bronchoalveolar type carcinoma\nextends to this ink.

No lymphovascular invasion is identified.\n\n1. \"Site\": not provided, as the report does not specify a clear site of origin for the tumor.\n2. \"Laterality\": not provided, as the report does not mention whether the tumor is on the left or right side.\n3. \"Histology\": malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST), as stated in the report. (\"The lesion is abutting and possibly arising from a nerve bundle and shows features consistent with a MPNST, WHO Grade III.\")\n4. \"Stage\": not provided, as the TNM stage requires information on the size of the tumor, lymph node involvement, and metastasis, which are not all given in this report.\n5. \"Grade\": Grade III (high grade), as stated in the report. (\"Features consistent with a MPNST, WHO Grade III.\")\n6. \"Behavior\": malignant, as indicated by the tumor being widely invasive and having brisk mitotic activity."

There is a vertical stapled line\nsuperior to the hilum measuring 80 mm in length. Over the apex there are two\nattached short segments of ribs. Rib 1 is relatively closely adhered over the\npleural surface and measures 55 x 30 x 28 mm. This rib is cut towards one end,\n22 mm from the true resectionmargin. Rib 2 loosely hangs from a fibrous.\nfragment and measures 55 x 28 x 18 mm. Over the posterolateral aspect of the,\nlung is a small segment of adherent parietal pleura measuring 30 x 25 mm.\nWithin the apex, underlying, the ribs is a firm white lesion measuring 25: x 25 x\n23 mm. The mass shows focal central necrosis. The tumour is well clear of the\nhilar resection margin. The apical rib is removed and the underlying pleural\nsurface is inked black. The true pleural margin is inked blue. The tumour\nappears to invade the pleura within this region, but does. not extend Into the\noverlying soft tissue.

(a-m) Left superior pulmonary lobe: resected lobe weighing 634g, and measuring 240 x 130 x 60 mm, with \nremnants of pleural adhesion and, adhering tightly to the hilar section, a pericardiallobe measuring 75 x 50 mrn, \nwith slightly whitish thickening and subhemorrhaging. In S 3 there is grayish-white, brittle, yellowish necrosis \nand anthracotic pigment including a polycyclic, well demarcated tumor, measming 75 x 50 x 95 mrn, extending \nunder the pericardia! lobe described and, with unclear demarcation, to the adjacent subpleural and mediastinal \nadipose tissue. B3 is tumorous in the intermediary section and destructed. The remaining segmental bronchi, \nwhich can be dissected up to the periphery, are unremarkable. In the hilar section there are anthracotic \npigmented and swollen, non-tumorous lymph nodes. In the peritumoral puhnonary tissue there is a golden\u00ad\nyellow, mesh-like parenchymal image (xanthomatous retention pneumonia?) and in S 1, accentuated in the \napical section, there is clear puhnonary emphysema with a coarse structure and possible honeycomb lung. \n2. Phrenic nerve: Grayish-brown, restif01m excised material, 6 mrn in length. \n3.

(HE, PAS, EvG) tumor-free bronchial wall in the instantaneous section and the subsequent paraffrn \nembedment in the bronchial resection margin. Immediately next to this there are numerous lymph nodes, some \nwith significant anthracotic pigment, with sinus histiocytosis and lymphofollicular hyperplasia as well as acute \nblood clotting. The described tumor, made up of solid and garland-shaped structures oflarge, pleomorphic cells \nwith a significantly misaligned nucleoplasmic ratio, chromatin coarsening and frequent mitosis with multiple \nnecrotic inclusions and concomitant stromal desmoplasia without keratinizing growth. Penetration of the \nmediastinal pleura with intrusion, starting focally, into the lipomatous-atrophic thymus tissue. The adjacent \npericardia! lobe is still tumor-free and there are further small non-tumorous lymph nodes embedded in the \nmediastinal adipose tissue. In the apical section of Sl there is a subpleural area of scarring with fibroelastosis \nand nearby, a significantly bullous and emphysematous lung structure with rarefied, stubby, upright and \npartially inflamed alveolar septa. In the peritumoral, intraalveolar area there is a partly compact build-up of \nfoamy cellular macrophages. \n2. (HE) tumor-free lymph node tissue with slight lymphofollicular hyperplasia. \n3.

Next to this, individual, swollen lymph nodes with \nanthracotic pigment but no suspicion of a tumor. In S 6 there is grayish-white tumor infiltration, well\u00ad\ndemarcated around the edge, measuring a good 40 rmn, extending up to the outer pleura, with central, post\u00ad\nnecrotic-pseudocystic resorption featuring small lesions, and grayish-yellow, fragile, infiltrated, inflammatory \npulmonary tissue. In B6, no discernible tumor infiltration or destruction in the central branches examined. \nImmediately next to the tumor there is an inflammatory, adherent section of lung (from the middle pulmonary \nlobe?), closed in by the base clip, measuring 15 mm, and without any discernible tumor infiltration. Other than \nthe tumorous and pneumonic infiltration on laminated sections, no further focal fmdings. \n3.

Base lymphoid infiltration and slight subpleural adipose connective tissue. \n2. (HE, f: PAS, e to h: EvG) The central bronchial amputation border has a \nbronchial wall with a regular stmcture, as does the peribronchial soft tissue. Next to this and further towards the \ncentral and hilar section there are lymph nodes with anthracotic pigment build-up and moderate histiocytosis as \nwell as slightly lymphatic hyperplasia and small scarred areas. The tumor described comprises mesh-like \ninfiltrative, growing structures of a pluriform, partly keratinizing, partly severe pleomorphic cell and squamous \ncell carcinoma with a clearly misaligned nucleoplasmic ratio, coarsening of the chromatin and prominent \nnncleoli and frequent mitosis. Extensive necrosis in the center of the tumor, with pseudocystic transformation, \nwith concomitant stromadesmoplasia and lymphoid and lymphofollicular infiltrates in the tumor periphery. \nExtension to the perifocal, reactive, fibrosed pleura with fibrinous exudate which is no longer fresh; the base \nmembrane of the pleura, with fragmented, elastic membrane here, is, however, not infiltrated. \nHemangioinvasion in the tumor center with a formation of obliterative tumor thrombi. Next to the tumor there \nare several confluent alveolar cavities with a build-up of granulocytes and foam cell macrophages, fibrinous \nexudate and fmally confluent, sprouting mesenchyme buds as well as expanded bronchia with mucus permeated \nby a large quantity of leucocytes. \n 3.

TNM classification according to this \npicture pT4 pNO pMX Rl, IIIB. C34.1 M8070/3. \nSecondary diagnosis/diagnoses: \nPleural tissue with marked chronic inflallllllation, blood pigment deposit and fibrous thickening (sample 1.)). \nExtensive tumor necroses. Active chronic organizing pneumonia in the tumor envirollll1ent. Moderate to marked \nactive chronic peripheral bronchitis and bronchiolitis. Foci of fibrin-rich and chronic granulating visceral \nneuritis over Sl. Hypoce!lular fibrosis zone of the adherent part of the parietal pleura (sample 2.)). Lymph \nnodes with uncharacteristic reactive lesions, anthracotic pigment deposits and sclerosis zones (samples 2.) and \n4.) -11.)). \nRemark/addendum: \nThe tumor extends to the adherent part of the parietal pleura and the soft portions of the co-resected parts of the \nchest wall. With regard to the localization data, sample 3.) shows a discontinuous spread of the carcinoma \nwithin pleura enlarged by fibrosis and showing fibrinous chronic inflallllllation, although no conclusion can be \ndrawn as to whether this is a visceral or parietal layer. The resection margins of bronchus and vessels of the \nmain preparation, the costal segments of the chest wall tissue, the repeat resection material from the pleura in \nsample 1.) and all excised lymph nodes are tumor-free. The Rl category is explained by the fact that the tumor \nhas spread focally as far as resection surface of the adherent part of the parietal pleura adjacent to the chest wall. \nNo asbestos bodies are found in the prepared section planes, but much further-reaching investigations, \nespecially dust analyses, are needed to determine the asbestos exposure of the lung. \n",

The diagnoses have not changed from the original report. \nThe lymph nodes resected in the case (specimen 1-8} show diffuse \ninvolvement with well-formed non-necrotizing granulomatous inflammation. \nOccasional mixed dust nodules with central hyalinization and focal \ncentral necrosis are also present. Special stains for fungal elements \nand acid-fast organisms are negative. There is no evidence of metastatic \ncarcinoma in any of the lymph nodes examined. \n;ctions of the tumor in specimen 8 show predominately moderately \ndifferentiated squamous cell carcinoma (90%}, with a small component \n(10%} of a poorly differentiated spindle cell carcinoma that demonstrates \nshows multiple mitoses and severe cytologic atypia. There is no \nmalignant cartilage, bone, or skeletal muscle identified in the spindle \ncell component. Immunohistochemistry shows the squamous cell component \nof the tumor to be positive for multiple cytokeratins (HMWK, CK5/6, \nAE1/AE3} and p63. The spindled component shows weak positive staining \nfor CK5/6 and p63, with very focal positive staining for CK7. The EGFR \nshows strong membranous staining in approximately 90% of both the \nmoderately differentiated-component and the spindled component. Both \ncomponents are negative for p53 and TTF-1. The findings are consistent \nwith a pleomorphic carcinoma composed of predominantly squamous cell \ncarcinoma (moderately differentiated, 90%} and pleomorphic spindle-cell \ncarcinoma (poorly differentiated, 10%}, pT2NO. \nThe residual lung parenchyma in both specimen 1 (\"wedge resection right \nmiddle lobe\"} and specimen 8 (\"right lower lobe\"} shows patchy \ninterstitial fibrosis that appears accentuated in a subpleural \ndistribution, with focal areas of architectural remodeling and cyst \nformation (microscopic honeycomb change} . There is mild chronic \ninterstitial inflammation associated with areas of fibrosis. Fibroblastic \nfoci are readily identified. The blood vessels show focal fibrointimal \nthickening, likely secondary to the background inflammatory process, but \nno diagnostic evidence of active vasculitis. Granulomas are noted within \nan intraparenchymal lymph node (specimen 1}, but are not identified in \nthe lung parenchyma itself . \n\u2022 ne overall findings in the lung tissue are in keeping with pulmonary \nStatus: corrected Page: 3 of 6 \n fibrosis of UIP pattern.

Page 3 00 \nThe carcinoma measured 5.7 em in greatest diameter and, therefore, \nis pathologically staged as a pT2b. Two peribronchial lymph nodes in \nthe right lung resection (specimen three) as well as a small area \nfrom random section from the right upper lobe parenchyma in 3M show \nfocal degeneration and necrosis vii th surrounding chronic \ngranulomatous inflammation and fibrosis. Therefore, an acid fast \nstain is performed which demonstrates no acid fast bacilli (with \nappropriate positive control). A GMS stain is performed which \ndemonstrates no fungal organisms (with appropriate positive \ncontrol) . \nSpecimen two, submitted as lymph node level 7 right chest, and \nspecimen four, submitted as lymph node level 8 right chest, both are \nreceived as fragmented to partially fragmented soft tissue and, \ntherefore, an accurate node count cannot be performed. No metastatic \ncarcinoma is identified. \nThe carcinoma is poorly differentiated and demonstrates foci of \nnecrosis and degeneration. In some areas intercellular bridges and \neosinophilic cytoplasm consistent with focal keratinization is \nidentified, consistent with a poorly differentiated squamous cell \ncarcinoma. Clinical correlation and followup is recommended. \nThis test has been finalized at the  \n<Sign Out Dr. Signature> \n  \n",

An  \naddendum report will be issued when the results of this molecular test are available.  \n \n Addendum #1 performed by \nElectronicall y signed \n \nADDENDUM #2:  \n  MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY  \n KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS  \n \n \nReferring PhysicianBody Site: Lung  \nSpecimen Type: Slides  \nClinical Data: Adenocarcinoma  \n RESULTS: Wild -type gene.  \n INTERPRETA TION: No mutations were identified at codons 12 and 13 \nof the KRAS gene.  COMMENT:  \nMutations in the KRAS gene are reported to be associated with poor prognosis, and resistance to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies in patients with non -small- cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  \nKRAS mutations occur in 15-30% of NSCLC patients and are strongly associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking history.  This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene; based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated  \nfor use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and codon 13 mutations in fresh, frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue. In particular the test performance has been established in samples of  \ncolorectal cancer and non -small cell lung carcinoma which harbor  \nthese mutations, although several other tissues are also known to harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix, etc.).  Analysis of EGFR mutation or gene amplification status may provide additional information regarding this patient's probability of response to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies, if clinically indicated. See references.  \n  \nMETHOD/LIMITATIONS:  \nTissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is  \nselected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified  \nand amplified by polym erase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to  \nexon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13; primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel  \nelectrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.  \n REFERENCES:  \n \n This test was developed and its performance characteristics  \ndetermined by  The laboratory is regulated under  \nthe Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of (CLIA) as qualified to perform high complexity clinical testing. This  \nparticular test is not considered a stand along test and should be used only in the context of other diagnostic tests or clinical work -up related to treatment decisions.  \n \n \n  Electronically signed by:  Date: \n Testing performed at \n \n    \n EGFR Mutation Analysis \n \n \n Referring Physician:  \n Body Site: Lung  \n Clinical D ata: Adenocarcinoma \n RESULTS: No mutation detected.  \n INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified in the sample provided for analysis. Fewer than 5% of non- small cell lung carcinoma  \npatients without identifiable mutations are reported to be  \nresponsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies.   COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more tumor cellularity is optimal  \nfor this mutation analysis. The sample submitted showed 30% tumor cellularity upon pathologist review.  A frequently occurring sequence change 2361G>A (Q787Q) was  \nidentified. This polymorphism is known not to have clinical significance.  \n Mutations in the tyrosine domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with differential  \nresponsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapies. The objective response rate among patients with a sensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%.  This assay analyzes exons 18 -21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain; \nbased on the current literature, most mutatio ns in non- small- cell \nlung carcinoma (NSCLC) are expected to occur in these exons.  \nMutations present in less than 10-20% of extracted DNA may not be detected by this method. Mutation status in a sample may change during tumor progression or the course of therapy; therefore, this  \nresult cannot be used to infer the presence or absence of a mutation in another sample or sub-sample obtained from this tumor.  This test is validated for non- small cell lung carcinoma. The  \nclinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types is unknown.  METHOD/LIMITATION:  \n Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is  \nselected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the samples, quantified  \nand amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to  \nexons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by \nbi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary gel  \nelectrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants or som atic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.  \n \n. \n DISCLAIMER:  \nThis test was developed and its performance characteristics  \ndetermined by It has not been cleared or approved by the  \nUS Food and Drug Administration.

Lung, right upper lobe, apical segment: segmentectomy (FS)\n-No tumor is seen at the bronchial margin.\nIntra-Operative Consultation #1 performed by Final Diagnosis performed by\nADDENDUM #1 FOR MOLECULAR TESTS:\nKRAS, EGFR and ALK FISH were sent on\nThe test is to be performed on\nThe case report ,slides, and blocks for the cited\naccession number were retrieved from archives .The pathologist whose\nsignature appears below reviewed the original pathology report,\nexamined candidate H&E slides ,and selected block 2C appropriate to\nthe specifications of the ordered molecular analysis. x 1 H&E and x9\nunstained slides were prepared and forwarded tc - '\nThere the subject molecular test will be performed. An\naddenaum report will be issued when the results of this molecular\ntest are available.\nAddendum #1 performed by\nADDENDUM #2:\nEGFR Mutation Analysis\nReferring Physician:\nBody Site :Right upper lobe of lung\nClinical Data: Adenocarcinoma\nRESULTS :No mutation detected.\nINTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified in the sample provided\nfor analysis. Fewer than 5% of non -small cell lung carcinoma\npatients without identifiable mutations are reported to be\nresponsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies.\nCOMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more tumor cellularity is optimal\nfor this mutation analysis. The sample submitted showed 90% tumor cellularity upon pathologist review.\nA frequently occurring sequence change 2361>GA (Q787Q) was\nidentified .This polymorphism is known not to have clinical\nsignificance.\nMutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth\nfactor receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with\ndifferential responsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase\ninhibitor (TKI) therapies. The objective response rate among\npatients with a sensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%.\nThis assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain;\nbased on the current literature ,most mutations in non -small-cell\nlung carcinoma (NSCLC) are expected to occur in these exons.\nMutations present in less than 10 -20% of extracted DNA may not be\ndetected by this method .Mutation status in a sample may change\nduring tumor progression or the course of therapy; therefore, this\nresult cannot be used to infer the presence or absence of a mutation\nin another sample or sub-sample obtained from this tumor.\nThis test is validated for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The\nclinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types\nis unknown.\nMETHOD:\nTissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is\nselected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified\nand amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to\nexons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by\nbi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary gel\nelectrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or\nnegative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants\nor somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.\nREFERENCES:\n1.Azzoli CG, et al.

KRAS\nmutations occur in 15-30% of NSCLC patients and are strongly\nassociated with adenocarcinoma and smoking history.\nThis assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;\nbased on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are\nexpected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of\nthe assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low\npercentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated for\nuse in identifying KRAS codon 12 and codon 13 mutations in fresh,\nfrozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue. In particular\nthe test performance has been established in samples of colorectal\ncancer and non-small cell lung carcinoma which harbor these\nmutations, although several other tissues are also known to harbor\nKRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix,\netc.).\nAnalysis of EGFR mutation or gene amplification status may provide\nadditional information regarding this patient's probability of\nresponse to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies, if\nclinically indicated. See references.\nMETHOD/LIMITATION:\nTissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is\nselected for analysis .DNA is isolated from the sample ,quantified\nand amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to\nexon 2 of the KRAS gene .PCR products are subjected to single\nnucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;\nprimer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel\nelectrophoresis and fluorescence detection .False positive or\nnegative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants\nor somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.\nREFERENCES:\nNSCLC\nMascaux C. lannino N, et al.

Based on laboratory validation data, these results are\nwithin the normal limits.\nCOMMENTS :Three copies of ALK were observed in 32 .0% of cells. This\ngain of intact ALK fusion hybridization signals represents an\naneuploid population with extra copies of chromosomes 2/2p ALK\nregion. Additional copies of ALK are not uncommon in NSCLCs,\nalthough the significance of extra copies of the ALK gene in lung\ncarcinoma is unclear at this time (Salido M. et al .

Laterobasal zone of adhesion over 52 \nand the border area of segments 2 and 3, where there was a part of the chest wall up to 12 x 9 cm in size \nincluding a rib segment 5.8 cm long. In addition a membranous part of the adhesive parietal pleura, fatty in \nplaces, 12 x 9 cm in size lying clear over S2 and 51. The latter extensively covered the lateral parts of 52 and \nbordering sections of 51 and was mainly without adhesion to the visceral pleura. There was another zone of \nadhesion in a medial direction, at about the point of attachment of the part of the chest wall, attached by a \nparenchymal flap enclosed by a row of clip sutures 6.5 x 5 x 2 cm in size (part of 56? middle lobe?). A nodular \ntumor, maximum 6.2 cm in size, at the base of 52, with dirty, whitish section surfaces, also focal grayish yellow \nsoftening, sharp and markedly arched distinction from the adjacent parenchymal tumor on one side, on the \nother side continuous infiltration of the visceral pleura and extension to the parenchymal flap attached \nmedially, where it extended to just by the base of the preparation and the row of clip sutures. In the region of \nthe contact point with the part of the chest wall, blackish thickening of the fused pleural lamina. Central \ndiscontinuation of B2 about 1.7 cm distally of the bifurcation in the tumor tissue, also of one of the sub\u00ad\nsegment branches of B3. The other bronchial branches free as far as the peripheral sections. About 3.5 cm \naway from the principal tumor in 51 a second, rather irregularly formed, pale grey tumor 1.6 cm in size in the \nsub-pleural parenchyma, distance from pulmonary tissue with normal section surfaces to the pleura about 3 \nmm. Central bronchial resection line located immediately proximal of the segment division point, by the \nbronchial stump a moderately solid node with dark grey pigment, 2.2 cm in size, damaged in places. \n2) Lobar LN (item 12) upper lobe: irregular, predominantly heavily pigmented fragment of 1.8 cm. \n3) Lobar LN (item 12) right lower lobe: node with blackish pigment, 1.8 cm in size, with some surrounding \ntissue. \n4) Inter-lobar lymph node (item 11) right: two fragments with largely blackish pigment, of 0.7 and 1.2 cm. \n5) Hilar LN (item 10) right: two nodes with grayish black pigment, 1.3 and 1,8 cm in size. \n6) Hilar LN (item 10) right (no. II): node 2.7 cm in size, apparently damaged and with blackish pigment, with \nsome surrounding fatty tissue. Borderline dubious small portion of a similar node.  7) Subcarinal LN (item 7): two preparations 1.2 and 2.3 cm in size with parts of at least 3 nodes with grayish \nblack pigment up to 1.7 cm. \n8) Low paratracheal LN (item 4) right: preparation rich in fatty tissue, 4.5 cm in size, with nodes, pale grey in \nplaces, blackish in places, between 0.3 and 1.2 cm. A further blackish node or partial node, 0.5 cm in size. \n9) Low paratracheal LN (item 4) right + left: fragment of fatty tissue 3.3 cm in size, inclusion of 3 nodes or \npartial nodes each up to 1.2 cm. \n10) Prevascular and retrotracheal node (item 3) right: longitudinal fragment of fatty tissue of 2.5 cm with two \nnodes or partial nodes with blackish pigment up to 1.2 cm. \n11) High paratracheal LN (item 2) right: node 1.4 cm in size with slate grey to reddish section surface and some \nfatty tissue attached, containing another small, pale grey node 2 mm in size. \n12) Lipoma: rounded, flat preparation 3.7 x 3 x 1.8 cm in size, with largely smooth, surface obviously covered \nby a soft capsule. Section surfaces largely golden yellow, grayish red border area measuring 7 mm in length. \nExamined \n1) Tumor and part of chest wall, tumor with attached parenchymal flap (where the section surface was \nmarked in color), 2 small apical tumor foci, 2 pieces of parenchyma free of tumor (Sl dorso-apical, S3 ventral, \ncentral bronchial resection line and vascular displacement borders, nodes by the bronchial stump (laminated), \n4 pieces of parietal pleura. \n2) -7), 9) -11) Total material in each case (small, isolated node in 11), \n8) Isolated node, \n12) 2 sections, \n20 blocks, Elastica-v.Gieson, PAS, diastasis PAS, iron \nMicroscopy \n1) The large tumor made up of small and large solid links of varying lengths, reticulate or branched in places, \nand of occasional evident large atypical epithelial cells coated in epidermoid cells, with ample, in the main \nweakly eosinophilic cytoplasm and nuclei showing major variation in coarse chromatin nuclear structure. \nNumerous apoptoses, frequently at least five mitoses in a highly magnified viewing field. No inclusion of \nmucin, instead intercellular bridges were repeatedly identified. In the center of solid tumor cell links, \ndegenerative changes in kariopyknoses and occasionally instances of cells showing dyskeratotic keratosis near \nsmall and large areas of necrosis. Basic pulmonary tissue completely destroyed, development of fibrous \nconnective tissue moderately rich in cells with inclusion of inflammatory cells and vessels with thick walls, \nsome of which were filled with tumor cell links. Pleural border exceeded by tumor over a broad area in the \nregion of a lobar cleft, also incursion into the visceral pleura over a broad area, where the adhesive part of the \nparietal pleura was free of tumor, only fibrotic. In addition here more pronounced chronic inflammatory cell  infiltrate. Towards the exterior including transversely striped muscle and intact rib bones with hematopoetic \ncells of all kinds and to a lesser extent fat cells in the marrow cavity. In the small tumor focus also nests and \nlinks of a solid, large cell tumor with characteristics of squamous cell epithelium structure, with here a short \nstretch of replacement of original respiratory epithelium of a peripheral bronchus by atypical squamous cell \nepithelium. Also destruction of the underlying pulmonary tissue, which was replaced by collagen and elastic \nconnective tissue, enclosed follicular lymphocyte aggregate and other inflammatory cells. Partially widened \nairways in the pulmonary tissue free of tumor, slight deposition of anthracotic pigment in peribronchiolovasal \nconnective tissue and alveolar parenchyma with quite predominantly soft interstices. No evidence of tumor at \nthe displacement borders of the bronchus and large pulmonary vessels, respiratory mucosa normal. Lymph \nnodes at the hilus with deposition of anthracotic pigment, accumulation of large macrophages and a few \nsecondary follicles. Adjacent lobes of the parietal pleura mainly entirely soft, only stretches of development of \nslightly fibrotic connective tissue.

Part one is received fresh, labeled 'wedge superior segment right\nlower lobe, stitch at nodule, freeze nodule, at 09:28'. It consists\nof a wedge biopsy of the lung measuring 10.5 x 3.5 x 1.5 cm. The\nstaple line measures 11 cm which is shaved and the parenchyma around\nis inked blue. The pleura are gray pink glistening and reveal a pre\ncut which is marked with a stitch. The precut area of the pleura is\npuckered and reveals a gray white ground glass nodule, measuring 0.8\nx 0.8 cm located 2 cm from the staple line margin. The remainder of\nthe parenchyma is pink red blotchy and crepitant. No other nodule is\ngrossly identified. A frozen section is performed on the nodule\nmarked with a stitch and resubmitted for permanent section.\nRepresentative sections are submitted.\n2. Part two is received in saline, labeled 'right middle lobe'. It\nconsists of right middle lobe of the lung, measuring 16 x 9.5 x 3.2\ncm. The bronchial margin measures 1.8 cm and the vascular margin\nmeasures 1 cm at the hilum. The pleura is gray pink glistening and\nmoderately mottled with fine black streaks. Also noted a precut and\npuckered area on the pleura. Beneath the puckered area there is a\ngray white subpleural firm nodule measuring 2.5 x 2 x 1.5 cm,\nlocated 1 cm from the staple line margin and 2 cm from the hilar\nstricture. Cut surface of the nodule is gray tan and reveals some\nnecrotic area. The remainder of the parenchy.ma_is pink. red- blotchy-\nand emphysematous. Multiple anthracotic lymph nodes measuring from\n0.3 cm up to 0.6 cm in largest dimension are identified from the hilar area. 80% of the nodule and representative section of the\nspecimen are submitted.\n3. Part three is received in saline, labeled 'level 4 lymph node'.\nIt consists of five anthracotic lymph nodes measuring from 0.2 up to\n0.8 cm. Entire lymph node is submitted in one cassette.\n4. Part four is received in saline, labeled 'level 7 lymph node'.\nIt consists of two anthracotic lymph nodes measuring 0.5 and 0.8 cm\nin greatest dimension. Entire two lymph nodes are submitted in one\ncassette.\nSUMMARY OF SECTIONS:\n1A frozen section remaining of the nodule\n1 B-1 E nodular area mark with a stitch\nIF staple line margin\n2A vascular margin, shaved\n2B bronchial margin, shaved\n2C-2E nodule with overlying puckered pleura\n2F nodule with adjacent normal parenchyma\n2G staple line margin\n2H lymph nodes\n21 random section of the parenchyma\n3A in toto\n4A in toto\nSPECIAL PROCEDURES:\nINTRA - OPERATIVE CONSULTATION:\n1.Lung, right lower lobe, superior segment: wedge resection\n(Frozen Section)\n-Adenocarcinoma with lepidic and acinar patterns.\nResult reported by\nIntra-Operative Consultation #1 performed by\nElectronically signed\nFinal Diagnosis performed by Electronically signed\nADDENDUM #1:\nINTEGRATED ONCOLOGY\nMOLECULAR ONCOLOGY\nKRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS\nReferring Physician:\nBody Site: Right lower lobe of lung\nSpecimen Type: Slides\nClinical Data: Adenocarcinoma\nRESULTS: Positive for a p.G12C (c.34G> T) mutation in codon 12\nof the KRAS gene.\nINTERPRETATION:\nMutations in the KRAS gene are reported to correlate with poor\nprognosis and resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies in\npatients with non- small-cell lung cancer.\nCOMMENT:\nKRAS mutations occur in 15-30% of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC)\npatients and are strongly associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking\nhistory.\nThis assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;\nbased on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are\nexpected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of\nthe assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low\npercentage of cells may not be detected.\nThis test is validated for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and\ncodon 13 mutations in fresh, frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin\nembedded tissue. In particular the test performance has been\nestablished in samples of colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung\ncarcinoma which harbor these mutations, although several other\ntissues are also known to harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of\npancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix, etc.).\nMETHOD/LIMITATIONS:\nTissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified\nand amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to\nexon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single\nnucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;\nprimer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel\nelectrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or\nnegative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants\nor somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.\nREFERENCES:\nNSCLC\nMascaux C, Iannino N, et al.

It consists of a \nlobectomy of lung weighing 163 grams. The lobe measures 12 x 11.5 x 3.5 cm. Just superior to the hilum \nof this lobectomy specimen, there is a wedge resection of additional lung suggestive of apical portion of \nright lower lobe. This adherent wedge resection measures 8 x 2.5 x 2 cm. The pleural surface of the \nupper lobe varies from tan to violet and appears smooth with very little anthracotic stippling. Where the \nlung wedge is adherent to the mid portion of the upper lobe, there is palpable firmness and slight \nretraction of the pulmonary parenchyma . The wedge resection is similarly adherent to the pleural surface \nof the lower portion of the upper lobe. A metallic staple line runs from the hilum of the lung along the \ninferior edge of the upper lobe and is 11 cm in length. The pleural surface overlying the adherent lung \nwedge and in the vicinity of the palpable firmness is inked blue. The staple line along the lung wedge is \ndissected free and the resection edge is inked green. On sectioning of this area of palpable firmness, \nthere is a relatively well-circumscribed tan to pale yellow neoplasm which overall measures 3.5 x 3.5 x \n2.9 cm. This neoplasm abuts the pleural surface of the upper lobe and passes across the interlobar fissure \nbetween the upper lobe and the apical portion of the lower lobe, to involve the adherent wedge resection. \nThis neoplasm is 0.5 cm from the closest bronchial margin, abuts the pleural surface in several areas, and \nis 0.4 cm from the stapled resection margin of the apical portion of the lower lobe. Sections of the \nremaining lung reveal pale red pulmonary parenchyma which appears relatively well-aerated. At the \nhilum of the lung, there are two 0.5-0.7 cm peribronchial dull red nodes. Dissection of the major bronchi \nreveal no intrabronchial tumor. The neoplasm is 6 cm or greater from the inferior staple line. \nRepresentative neoplasm is obtained in its fresh state for research purposes.

The pleural surface is tan to gray-brown and lightly\nwrinkled with 3 subpleural nodular structures ranging \nfrom 0.4 to 0.6 cmalong the base. Along the posterolateral aspect near the base is a 2.7 x1.0 cm firm tan subpleural mass that comes to within approximately 5 cm ofthe bronchial margin, which is shaved and submitted for frozen section. Theoverlying pleura is puckering and is focally inked blue. Sectioning throughthe separate subpleural nodules reveals glistening gray-tan cut surfaces.The background lung is tan to red and spongy white to white-tan hilar lymphnode measuring 0.5 and 0.6 cm. \n Microscopic Description\nThe bronchial margin is negative for carcinoma. In the section from the\nbronchial margin, a small lymph node is identified which is negative for\nmetastatic carcinoma. Also, there are two additional hilar lymph nodes\nwhich are both negative for metastatic carcinoma. The lung mass is aninvasive poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma merging with a peripheral\nbronchioloalveolar type pattern. The invasive carcinoma focally involves\nthe visceral pleura surface. In this area, free floating tumor cells areseen in blood clot external to the visceral pleura surface. The vascular\nmargins are negative for neoplasm. No angiolymphatic space involvement bytumor is seen. The separate subpleural nodules are consistent with small\nfoci of metaplastic epithelial proliferations (honeycombing). These nodulesare composed of epithelial cells that have a mucinous as well asnonmucinous appearance and many demonstrate cilia. There is a focus of\nsquamous metaplasia associated with one of these areas. There is no nuclear\natypia. Nonneoplastic lung shows emphysematous features.\nImmunohistochemical stains are performed for CK7, CK20, TTF-1, CDX 2 and\nNapsin A. Control material for each individual stain demonstratesappropriate staining. The malignant cells are positive for Napsin A, CK7and TTF-1. There is focal positivity for CK20.  The malignant cells are\nnegative for CDX 2. These findings support the interpretation of a primary\nlung adenocarcinoma. Diagnosis Details Comments\nLUNG CARCINOMA CHECKLIST\n1.

The pleural surface is puckered on the anteromedial aspect of the \nsuperior portion of the lobe and underlying this there is a firm mass. This has been incised prior to \nreception in the laboratory . Otherwise the pleural surface is umemarkable. There are two suture lines \nextending from the hilum. One extends superiorly and measures 40 mm the other inferiorly and \nmeasures 35 mm. Sectioning reveals a large poorly circumscribed tumour mass underlying the area of \npleural puckering described. Defining its dimensions macroscopically is difficult but it would be \napproximately 70 CSI) x 60 (AP) x 70 mm (ML). It is made difficult as the tumour merges \nimperceptibly with probable endogenous lipoid pneumonia in the surrounding parenchyma. The \ntumour mass extends from the anterior pleural surface to the posterior pleural surface and extends to \nwithin 10 mm of the bronchial resection margin. A discrete firm nodule is noted in the mid lateral \nportion of the lobe which measures 5 x 5 x 5 mm. This appears to be separate from the main tumour. \n[lA, bronchial resection margin; IB-IC peribronchial lymph nodes; ID-IF tumour and relationship to \nanterior pleural surface; IG, probable tumour and superior aspect oflobe; IH, tumour and posterior \naspect oflobe; II, inferior aspect of tumour; lJ, section including the firm small nodule described; IK, \nsection of normal lung.] Specimen has been sampled for research. \n2: The second specimen is labelled 'pulmonary vein' and consists of what appears to be a piece of \nlymphoid tissue measuring 14 x 8 x 7 mm. Sectioning reveals only lymph node. [Bisected, BIT, 2A.] \n3: The third specimen is labelled 'No.9 lymph node' and consists of a piece of nodal tissue measuring \n33 x 15 x 17 mm. [Trisected, BIT, 3A-3B.] \n4: The fourth specimen is labelled 'No. 10 lymph node' and consists ofa single piece of nodal tissue ~ 24 x 14 x 14 mm. [Bisected, BIT, 4A.] \nMICROSCOPIC \nI. Sections show a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. The tumour has a papillary architecture \nand includes areas with psammoma bodies and 'Orphan Annie' nuclei. There is a small component \nwith features of rnicropapillary differentiation . Although this may represent a lung primary, special \nstains are being performed to exclude a thyroid or an ovarian primary. Surrounding the mass, there is a \npatchy lepidic growth pattern and carcinoma is identified both within the airspaces and lymphatics in \nthe section from the normal lung. The nodule in the mid lateral portion of the lobe is a focus of tumour \nwith a surrounding lepidic growth pattern. The lesion is subpleural and the tumour invades into the \nvisceral pleural surface. There is possible focal surface involvement. Blood vessel and lymphatic \ninvasion is present. No perineural permeation is seen. Adenocarcinoma is present within all the \nperibronchial lymph nodes including one at the bronchial resection margin. Extracapsular extension is \nnoted. Also present at the bronchial resection margin, there is lymphatic permeation within the \nmucosa. No dysplasia is seen. There is insufficient normal lung parenchyma for assessment of \nabnormalities. \n2. Sections show a lymph node involved by metastatic adenocarcinoma. \n3. Sections show lymph nodes involved by metastatic adenocarcinoma. \n4.

Some patchy \npositivity is identified with progesterone receptor markers but no convincing positivity is seen with the \noestrogen receptor markers. This immunohistochemical profile would support a diagnosis of primary \npulmonary adenocarcinoma. \nT-2S000 M-S1403 PI-03000 \n \n",

Left lower lobe: inflated, fixed left lower lobe of lung measuring 20 x 15 em at the base and up to 17 em in length, \ncentral bronchus resection plane located 0.3 em proximal to the bifurcation of 86. A 7 em long branched staple suture \nline runs in a ventrocaudal direction from the hilus. In the medioventral region over 56 a cusp-shaped part of the upper \nlobe measuring 4 x 1.5 x 1.2 em is attached, closed by a staple suture line. In the laterodorsal region over 56 and \nadjacent sections of 510, part of the parietal pleura, measuring 9.5 x 5.5 em, is mostly adhesive over an extensive area \nand loosely attached in parts at the margin. At the hilus are 3 mobile grayish-black nodes between 0.2 and 0.7 em in size. \nOstium of 86 completely obstructed by endobronchial parts of a central, moderately solid, pale brownish, focally soft \ntumor, max. 6 em in size, located in 56, with unclear demarcation and extending right up to the ventral visceral pleura \nover 56 and to within 0.2 em of the hilar resection surface.

However, one or more polymorphic sequence changes were discovered in the EGFR gene.\nThese polymorphisms are interpreted as non-pathogenic because they do not lead to amino acid changes. These polymorphisms are not expected to\nhave any clinical significance. As 7% of patients who respond to EGFR inhibitors do not show mutations in exons 18-21 of EGFR gene, a negative result\ndoes not preclude the possibility of a clinical response to EGFR inhibitors.\nK\u201eS Mutation Analysis\nKRAS Mutation :DETECTED\n(Abnormal) Results reviewed by\nBased on sequence analysis ,K-Ras codon 12 GGT>GAT (GI2D) mutant was detected.\nLung Ca (NSCLC),ALK,FISH: SEE BELOW\nSpecimen Type: Paraffin Embedded Tumor Tissue\nClinical Indication: FISH study for oncology\nMethod : FISH\nTotal Cells : 50\nImages Captured : 2\nRESULT: NEGATIVE FOR ALK REARRANGEMENT [SEE COMMENT BELOW)\nINTERPRETATION:\nFluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis did not reveal a rearrangement of the ALK gene. However, 1-3 additional copies of the ALK region were\nobserved in 80% of cells. The significance of additional copies of the ALK region is not dear.\nIn non-small cell lung carcinoma, overexpression of the AL.K kinase is seen most commonly through an inversion producing ELM4-ALK fusion protein. A\nsmall proportion of tumors (approximately 5%) with ALK rearrangement demonstrated byother methods may be missed by this study. This test is\nindicated as an aid in the assessment of patients for whom crizotinib (i.e. XALKORI) treatment is being considered. Correlation with clinical findings and\nother laboratory studies is indicated.\nPlease expect the result of any other concurrent test in a separate report.\nFISH test was performed using a break-apart probe specific for the ALK gene According to the manufacturers directional\ninsert, the cutoff value for ALK rearrangement is 15% of interphase cells in paraffin-embedded specimens.

Sections of specimen 6 show soft tissue with rare small clusters of \ntumour cells. One such cluster demonstrates probable perineural invasion. \n8. Sections show two separate tumors composed of poorly differentiated \ncarcinoma with focal suggestion of squamous differentiation. The larger \ntumor is found superiorly in the lower lobe. This tumor invades and \npuckers the overlying pleura, but chest wall invasion. and invasion into \nthe upper lobe are not identified. However, a second tumor is identified \nmore centrally in the upper lobe. This is separate from the RLL tumor, \nmeasures 3 em in greatest dimension, and shows similar histology to that \nof the RLL tumor. The tumor demonstrates extensive vascular invasion, \nincluding invasion of some larger vessels, and several pulmonary infarcts \nare noted in the upper lobe. Multiple peribronchial lymph nodes are \ninvolved by tumor, including by direct invasion of the RUL tumor. By \nimmunohistochemistry, the tumor cells show strong cytoplasmic staining \nfor 5/6, focal moderate staining for high and low molecular weight \ncytokeratin, and moderate to strong nuclear staining for p63. The tumor \ncells are negative for cytokeratin 7 and 20, and TTF-1. The morphological \nand immunohistochemical features are consistent with poorly \ndifferentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Given the morphologic \nsimilarities between the RUL and RLL tumors and the extent of vascular \ninvasion, the RUL tumor is strongly favored to represent a metastasis \nfrom the RLL tumor. The pathologic stage is therefore assessed to be \npT2N1M1. \nPage: 3 of 10 \n CLINICAL HISTORY \nLUNG CA \nGROSS DESCRIPTION \n1.

The specimen labeled with the patient's name and as \"LUNG: right lung \nbronchial resection with ribs 4 & 5/QS\". The specimen is received fresh \nand subsequently placed in to 10% buffered formalin .. It consists of a \nright lung: upper, middle and lower lobes, with overall dimensions of \n-1 .\u2022 0 em SI x 21.0 em ML x 7.5 em AP. A small portion of unremarkable 4th \n.d 5th ribs are identified on the upper lobe, measuring 5.0 x 1.4 x 0.7 \nem and 7. 4 x 1. 4 x Q. 8 em. The' pleural surfaces of all three lobes are \nhomogeneously purple and congested, showing diffuse black pigmentation. \nCross sections of the right upper lobe reveal three separate, poorly \ndefined lesions. The largest measuring 3.0 x 3.0 x 2.3 em, located within \nthe ?anterior segment. The cut surface of this lesion is homogeneously \nwhite and firm. Further sections\u00b7show gross invasion into the bronchus \nand adjacent lymph nodes. This tumor is located -1.5 em from the \nbronchial resection margin, and 0.6 em from the closest pleural surface. \nThe two smaller lesions are located 2.0 em beneath the ribs, within the \nanterior aspect. Both lesions are homogeneously tan, solid and grossly \nappear to have a red hemorrhagic center measuring 1.2 x 0.7 x 0.7 em and \n1.5 x 1.0 x 1.0 em. The distance between the two smaller lesions is 0.6 \nem. Both lesions are located -s.o em from the bronchial resection margin \nand 1.1 em from the closest pleural surface. The remaining parenchyma of \nthe right upper lobe is homogeneously dark brown and unremarkable. \nCross. sections of the right middle lobe are homogeneously dark brown, \nspongy and unremarkable. \nWithin the superior segment of the right lower lobe, a well-circumscribed \ntumor is noted measuring s.o x 4.0 x 4.4 em. The cut surface of the \ntumor is homogeneously white and firm; located 5.5 em from the bronchial \nresection margin. cross sections of the tumor show that it abuts the \npleural surface, causing \"pleural puckering\". Further sections reveal \ngross invasion into the pleura. Approximately 1.5 em from the larger \nmor, a smaller calcified nodule is noted (within the base of the right \n-vwer lobe) measuring 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.2 em. The remaining parenchyma of \nPage: 5 of 10 \n the right lower lobe is homogeneously dark brown and otherwise \nunremarkable. \nMultiple lymph nodes are noted throughout the right lung, ranging from \no\u00b7. 3 to 2. a em.

Received in formalin is an ovoid soft tissue fragment, 1.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm in greatest dimension. The specimen is bisected \nand submitted in toto in one block. \nF. Received fresh is a lung resection specimen, which is anatomically distorted, with multiple staple lines. The pleural \nsurface is intact, pale purple-blue without any areas of obvious puckering. There is a main stem bronchus extending from \nthe specimen for a distance of 4 cm. Surrounding this bronchus are multiple subcarinal lymph nodes. Attached to the \nanterior lateral surface of the specimen are three ribs. The lung measures 21 x 14 x 8 cm in greatest dimension. The \nattached rib measures 12.5 cm in length and 7.5 cm in aggregate diameter. Upon opening the specimen along the \nbronchial tree, there is a cystic mass replacing the majority of the lung parenchyma. It measures 9.3 x 8.5 x 8 cm in \ngreatest dimension. The cystic mass is unilocular. The wall of the mass is at most 2.5 cm in thickness. Centrally located \nwithin the cyst is hemorrhagic and necrotic fluid. Upon removing the fluid, a large papillary necrotic mass is identified \nmeasuring at most 5 cm in greatest dimension. This lesion grossly appears to approach the pleura at the right superior \nlateral aspect close to the ribs and is grossly at a distance of 0.1 cm from the inked pleural surface. Grossly, this lesion \nappears to focally involve the surrounding portion of rib in the central portion of the length of the rib and is at least 2.5 cm \nfrom the anterior bone resection margin and at least 2 cm from the lateral posterior bone resection margin.

No perineural invasion Is seen, \nbut the tumour extends up to the surgical rese~ion margin at this \npoint and residual microscopic disease cannot be excluded. One of \nfive peribronchial lymph nodes contains metastatic carcinoma. \nThe bronchial resection margin is clear of tumour. \nSections of adjacent non-tumour lung show an area of scarring in \nrelation to arteries showing evidence of recanalisation, interpreted \nas likely to be consequent to vascular changes related to tumour at \n\u2022 \n the lung hilum. \nThe hilar lymph node and lymph node designated number 5 show no \nevidence of malignancy. Metastatic squamous carcinoma is present \nin the separately submitted lymph node referenced as number 7. \nDiagnosis: \nLeft lung: Moderately differentiated keratinising squamous \ncarcinoma with extra-pleural soft tissue extension, \nmetastatic to peribronchial and number 7 lymph nodes. \ncc:  \nPathologist : DR_ Registrar: DR \nValidated by DR \nFurther sections of pericardium, i I soft tissue and pleura have \nbeen submitted for histology (EBl-3).

Part one is labeled 'lung, right upper lobe'. It consists of a right lobe of lung, measuring 15.5 x 10.5 x 4 cm. The two staple lines measures 6 cm and 5.5 cm which is shaved and the pleura around the staple line is inked in black. The bronchial margin at the hilum  \narea measures 2 cm and the vascular margin measures 1.2 cm. The  \npleura are gray pink glistening and mottled moderately with fine black streaks. There is a puckered area measuring 2.5 cm in greatest  \ndimension. Beneath the puckered area there is a gray white firm  \nnodule with ill defined borders measuring 3.5 x 3 x 2 cm, located 3 cm from the bronchial resection margin, and 2 cm from the closest staple line margin. The remainder of the parenchyma is red and  \nblotchy. No other nodule grossly identified. Multiple anthracotic  \nfirm lymph nodes ranging from 0.3 cm to 0.6 cm identified from the hilar and peribronchial area. Representative sections are submitted.  \n 2. Part two is labeled 'station 10 lymph node'. It consists of multiple soft red -black lymph nodes measuring 2.4 x 2 x 0.5 cm in \naggregate. Entirely submitted in one cassette.  \n 3. Part three is labeled 'station 11 lymph node '. It consists of multiple soft red -black lymph nodes measuring 2 x 1.7 x 0.6 cm in \naggregate. Entirely submitted in one cassette.  \n 4. Part four is labeled 'station 2 and 4 lymph node'. It consists of multiple soft red -black lymph nodes measuring 0.5 cm to 0.8 cm. \nEntirely submitted in three cassettes.  \n 5. Part five is labeled 'station 7 lymph node '. It consists of multiple soft red -black lymph nodes measuring 2.4 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm in \naggregate. Entirely submitted in one cassette.  \n \n \n \n SUMMARY OF SECTIONS:  \n1A-1E nodule \n1F staple line margin  \n1G bronchial margin, shaved 1H vascular margin, shaved  \n1I anthracotic lymph node 1J random section 2A entirely submitted  \n3A entirely submitted  \n4A-4C entirely submitted  \n5A entirely submitted  \n SPECIAL PROCEDURES:  \nElastic  \n   Final Diagnosis performed by \nElectronically \n \n    ADDENDUM #1 FOR MOLECULAR TESTS:  \n KRAS, EGFR and ALK were sent on for patient  \nThe test is to be performed on tissue from case \nThe case report, slides, and blocks for the cited  \naccession number were retrieved from archives. The pathologist whose signature appears below reviewed the original pathology report, examined candidate H&E slides, and selected block 1B appropriate to  \nthe specifications of the ordered molecular analysis. x1 H&E and x9 unstained slides were prepared and forwarded to where the  \nsubject molecular test will be performed. An addendum report will be issued when the results of this molecular test are available.  \n  Addendum #1 performed by \n \nElectronically signed     \n  \nADDENDUM #2:  \n   MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY  \n KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS  \n \n \nReferring Physician:  \nBody Site: Right upper lobe of lung Specimen Type: Slides  \nClinical Data: Adenocarcinoma  RESULTS: Positive for a p.G12V (c.35G>T) mutation in codon 12 of the KRAS gene.  INTERPRETATION:  \nMutations in the KRAS gene are reported to correlate with poor prognosis and resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies in patients w ith non- small- cell lung cancer.  \n COMMENT:  \nKRAS mutations occur in 15-30% of non- small- cell lung cancer (NSCLC)  \npatients and are strongly associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking history.  This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene; based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low percentage of cells may not be detected.  \n This test is valid ated for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and \ncodon 13 mutations in fresh, frozen, or formalin- fixed paraffin  \nembedded tissue. In particular the test performance has been established in samples of colorectal cancer and non -small cell lung  \ncarcinoma which h arbor these mutations, although several other \ntissues are also known to harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix, etc.).   METHOD/LIMITATIONS:  \nTissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is  \nselected fo r analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified  \n and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to \nexon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13; primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel  \nelectrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.  \n REFERENCES:  \n \n This test was developed and its performance characteristics  \ndetermined by The laboratory is regulated under  \nthe Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of as \nqualified to perform high complexity clinical testing. This  \nparticular test is not considered a stand along test and should be used only in the context of other diagnostic tests or clinical work-up related to treatment decisions.  \n \n. \n   Electronically signed by:  \nDate:  \n \n Addendum #2 performed by \nElectronically signed \n ADDENDUM #3:  \n \n  \nEGFR Mutation Analysis  \n \n Referring Physician:  \n Body Site: Right upper lobe of lung  Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma  \n RESULTS: No mutation detected . \n INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified in the sample provided for analysis. Fewer than 5% of non- small cell lung carcinoma  \npatients without identifiable mutations are reported to be  \nresponsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies.   COMMENT : Forty percent (40%) or more tumor cellularity is optimal  \nfor this mutation analysis. The sample submitted showed 4% tumor cellularity upon pathologist review  A frequently occurring sequence change 2361G>A (Q787Q) was identified. This polymorphism is known not to have clinical significance.  \n Mutations in the tyrosine domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with differential  \nresponsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapies. The objective response rate among patients with a sensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%.  This assay analyzes exons 18 -21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain; \nbased on the current literature, most mutations in non- small- cell \nlung carcinoma (NSCLC) are expected to occur in these exons.  \nMutations present in less than 10-20% of extracted DNA may not be detected by this method. Mutation status in a sample may change during tumor progression or the course of therapy; therefore, this result cannot be used to infe r the presence or absence of a mutation  \nin another sample or sub-sample obtained from this tumor.  This test is validated for non- small cell lung carcinoma. The  \nclinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types  \nis unknown.  \n METHOD/LIMITAT ION:  \nTissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is  \nselected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the samples, quantified  \nand amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to \nexons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by  \nbi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary gel  \nelectrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.  \n REFERENCES : \n \n   DISCLAIMER:  \nThis test wa s developed and its performance characteristics  \ndetermined by  It has not been cleared or approved by the  \nUS Food and Drug Administration.

A large area of parietal pleural adhesion is noted on the anterolateral surface. Beneath \nthis a firm mass is palpable within the anterior segment. On sectioning a mass is confirmed within the \nlung. The mass measures 40 x 17 x 32 mm and has a cream to tan cut surface with black streaking. \nThe tumour lies adjacent to the area of thickened and adherent pleura. The tumour is over 25 mm away \nfrom the medial pleural surface and is well clear of the posterior pleural surface. The tumour is at least \n40 mm away from the bronchial resection margin. The uninvolved lung tissue appears unremarkable. \n[lA, bronchial resection margin; IB, peribronchial lymph nodes; 1 C, tumour with adherent lateral \npleura; ID, adjacent medial pleural margin; IE-IF, further sections through tumour; IG, uninvolved \nlung]. \n2: The specimen is labelled \"lymph node No.5\" and consists of a single fragment of cream fatty tissue \ncontaining grey-black lymph nodes. The specimen measures 25 x 18 x 7 mm. No obvious \nis noted on sectioning.

Definite \nvascular or lymphatic invasion is not identified. Metastatic adenocarcinoma is present in one of the \nperibronchial lymph nodes with transcapsular extension into adjacent hilar fibrofatty tissue and \nperineural and intraneural invasion in this region. The bronchial resection margin is clear of \nmalignancy but shows several foci of squamous metaplasia and low-grade dysplasia.

The tumor is located in the right lung lobe, extending to the pleural surface. The TNM staging indicates a T2 stage based on the size of the tumor and invasion to the pleura. The grade is determined by the description of the tumor as poorly differentiated with eosinophilic cytoplasm and areas of apparent intercellular bridges. The behavior of the tumor is malignant due to its histology and staging."

The pleural surface is dusky and pink-purple with a large amount of\nblack anthracotic pigment present. There is a, large 6.4 x 5 x 4.5 cm gray-white to gray-black mass extending from\nthe lower portion of the upper lobe into the attached portion of lower lobe and into the attached portion of chest\nwall. The lesion appears grossly to come within 3.2 cm of the staple line on the lower lobe and appears grossly to\ninvade into the central rib bone. The tumor grossly extends to within 3.2 cm of the peripheral margin of the\nresected chest wall. The lung tissue unaffected by tumor is soft, spongy and dark red to gray-black. There are\nnumerous soft, gray-black anthracotic lymph nodes present at the hilum. Representative sections are submitted as\nAl - bronchial margin for frozen section; A2 - peripheral chest wall margin for frozen section; A3 - en face margin\nfrom staple line on right lower lobe; A4-A6 - mass(A4 & A6 include tumor involving RLL); A7 - normal lung; A8 -\nhilar lymph node, bisected; A9-A10 - intact hilar lymph nodes; A11-A12 - invasion of tumor into rib bone after\ndecalcification.\nFROZEN SFr'-TION n'AGNOS a esection tnargin and chest wall margin negative for malignancy.\nCalled to at . by\nB.

The pleura overlying \nthe anterior basal segment is puckered and shows a small amount of adherent pale tissue. On \nsectioning the lung in this area, there is diffuse infiltration by pale and tan tumour which has a rubbery \ncut surface. The tumour appears to abut the lateral and diaphragmatic pleural surfaces. The lesion \nmeasures approximately 50 x 60 x 45 mm. The tumour also involves the posterior lateral basal and \nanterior basal segments . Tumour appears to surround a major segmental bronchus and extends close \nto the bronchial resection margin. The tumour does not appear to involve the medial margin. \n[Tumour and diaphragmatic pleura, A; tumour and medial pleural surface, B; tumour and lateral \npleural surface, C-D; bronchial resection margin, E; tumour and bronchus immediately adjacent to \nbronchial resection margin, F; hilar nodes, G; non-neoplastic lung, H.} \nMicroscopy: \nSections show a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma with a prominent mucinous bronchiolo-alveolar \ncarcinoma component. Focally the tumour appears to be invasive. It closely abuts the pleural surface. \nOverlying this there is a thick organising fibrinous pleurisy. Although definite invasion of the pleura is \nnot seen, there are suspicious features and special stains will be performed No vascular or perineural \ninvasion is seen. Small satellite deposits of tumour are scattered throughout the adjacent parenchyma. \nThese are also identified in the parenchyma of the section taken of the bronchus immediately adjacent \nto the bronchial resection margin (Block F). Both the bronchial resection margin and the bronchus \nwithin the immediately adjacent section show no evidence of malignancy. No metastases to hilar \nlymph nodes are seen. The lung tissue away from the mass in block H shows no specific abnormality. \n2: HILAR LYMPH NODE \nMacroscopy: \nSpecimen consists of a single piece of grey firm tissue which measures 12 x 5 x 5 mm. \nMicroscopy: \nSections of the lymph node show carbon deposition and sinus histiocytosis but no evidence of \nmetastatic malignancy. \nSummary: \nLeft lower lobe and hilar lymph node: \n1.

Serial sections taken \nthrough specimen. No discrete lesion identified. [BIT for FS.] \nFROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS: \nAdenocarcinoma (abuts diathermy margin). \nResult phoned to   \n[Frozen section remnants, lA.] \n2: The second specimen is labelled with the patient's details only and consists ofa left \npneumonectomy specimen. The left upper lobe measures 250 (SI) x 150 (AP) x 70 mm (ML). The left \nlower lobe measures 230 (SI) x 140 (AP) x 70 mm (ML). There is an incomplete fissure on the lateral \nsurface of the left lower lobe. Over the lateral aspect of the pleura of the left upper lobe there is a \nbroad area of pallor under which the lung parenchyma is firm. This area measures approximately 140 \nx 110 rnm. Similar subpleural firm pale areas are present throughout the lingula and are present on \nboth the lateral and medial aspects of the pleura and varying in size from 3 rnm up to 30 mm. At the \nhilar aspect of the lung the bronchial resection margin measures 20 rnm in diameter and is raised 30 \nmm from the surrounding tissue. A single area of pale subpleural thickening is noted in the left lower \nlobe measuring 11 mm in maximum dimension . This area occurs on the anterior aspect of the left \nlower lobe in the interlobar fissure. There are three areas of pleural deficiency on the left upper lobe; \none anterior and lateral measuring 30 rnm in diameter and one overlying the pale area posteriorly and \nsuperiorly measuring 30 rum in diameter where the pleura appears pulled back and is able to be laid \nover the deficit. A third sutured area of pleural deficit and an underlying parenchymal defect is noted \nat the postero-inferior edge of the left upper lobe laterally. This area measures 30 mm in diameter. \nOn sectioning the lung, the majority of the left upper lobe is replaced by confluent pale tumour \nmeasuring 165 (SI) x 120 (AP) x up to 60 rnm (ML). There are numerous other deposits in the lingula \nand in the most inferior aspect of the left upper lobe varying in size from 1 mm up to 20 rnm. There is \nextensive subpleural tumour with the large majority of the lateral aspect of the pleura appearing to be \ninvolved by tumour. Further sectioning reveals tumour to abut the pleura on the medial aspect of the \nleft upper lobe adjacent to the hilum. Tumour approaches but does not appear to reach the hilar \nresection margin. There is no definite tumour on the visceral pleural surface. \nSectioning the left lower lobe also reveals multiple deposits of pale tumour both in superior and \ninferior aspects of the lobe. These tumour deposits vary in size from 5 up to 30 rnm in maximum \nextent. \n[Bronchial resection margin, 2A; hilar lymph nodes, 2B; vascular resection margins, 2C; hilar and \nperibronchial lymph nodes, 2D-2E; tumour underlying pleura and adjacent inked hilar resection \nmargin, 2F; tumour underlying pleura of left upper lobe adjacent to hilar resection margin, 2G; solid \narea of tumour medial left upper lobe no pleura, 2H; inferior left upper lobe tumour and overlying \npleura, 21; superior, 2J; lateral area of inferior left upper lobe in region of sutured pleural defect (? \nFrozen site), 2K; lateral left upper lobe, 2L; left lower lobe inferior, two separate tumour deposits, 2M; \nleft lower lobe superiorly, 2N-20; uninvolved lung left lower lobe, 2P.] \n3: The third specimen is labelled 'hilar lymph node' and consists of three lymph nodes which measure \n18 x 20 xIS mm in maximum extent. [Two bisected, 3A; third bisected, 3B.] \n4: The fourth specimen is labelled 'mediastinal lymph node' and consists of five fragments oflymph \nnode varying in size from 5 up to 12 rnm in maximum extent and one piece of fat measuring 5 rnm. \n[Lymph nodes bisected in toto, 4A.] \n 5: The fifth specimen is labelled 'hilar lymph node' and consists of a single lymph node measuring 12 \nmm in maximum extent. [Bisected in toto, SA.] -MlICROSCOPIC \n1: Paraffin sections confirm the frozen section diagnosis of adenocarcinoma. Lepidic extension of \ntumour is also noted. The overlying visceral pleura is not infiltrated by tumour. Tumour involves the \ndiathermied margin. \n2: Within the upper and lower lobes there are multiple deposits of well differentiated adenocarcinoma \nwhich in areas show relatively extensive lepidic extension . The invasive tumour shows a predominant \npapillary architecture and is composed of mucinous and non-mucinous cells. Tumour deposits abut the \nvisceral pleura in number of areas and there is focal visceral pleural invasion. No pleural surface \ninvolvement is seen. There is distension of some lymphatic channels. No unequivocal lymphatic \ninvasion is seen. No vascular invasion or perineural permeation is identified. The bronchial resection \nmargin is clear of tumour. Tumour approaches to within 30um of the peri-hilar margin in an area \ndevoid of pleura. Although this margin is closely approached , tumour is not transected in this region. \nTumour abuts the area of diathermy artefact within the upper lobe corresponding to the biopsy site for \nfrozen section. In a separate area, tumour abuts visceral pleura which shows diathermy artefact \nprecluding further assessment. Tumour infiltrates one of the lymph nodes within the hilar region by \ndirect extension. The remaining lymph nodes are not involved.

Wedge left lower lobe: after removal of the angled, 13 em long staple suture line, inflated, fixed lung \nresection tissue measuring 10 x 2 em at the base, up to 4.5 em thick, with pleural margin. Visceral pleura shows \nslightly reticulate blackish pigmentation with an eccentric 2 em area of star-shape retraction. Under this is a \nwhitish tumor, 1.9 em in size, with unclear demarcation, at a distance ofO.l em from the staple suture line. Rest \nof parenchyma shows partial rarefaction with the formation of lacunae max. 0.2 em in size. \n2.) Left lower lobe: inflated, fixed left lower lobe measuring 17 x 7 em at the base, up to 20.5 em high. Central \nbronchus resection plane located at the level of bifurcation B6. At the hilus two partly lesioned nodes, 0.7 em \nand 3 em in size. A staple suture line runs from the hilus in a cranial direction for 4 em, and a staple suture line \nruns from the hilus in a caudoventral direction for 5.5 em. At the laterobasal margin over S8-10 there is a 16 em \nstaple suture line demarcating an arcuate defect (status post wedge resection).

Slight centroacinar \npulmonary emphysema (samples 1.) and 2.)). Hypocellular fibrosis area of parietal pleura (sample 3.)). Lymph \nnodes with large foci of epithelioid cell reaction, nodular, central partly necrotically altered areas of sclerosis \nand anthracotic pigment deposits (samples 4.)-7.) and 9.)). Sebonheic keratosis of the skin of the akanthotic \ntype (sample 11.)). \nRemark/addendum: \nThe carcinoma shows lymphangioinvasion at the tumor margin and has produced metastases in the hilar lymph \nnodes of sample 2.) and in samples 8.) and 10.). The visceral pleura, the residual lower lobe of the lung, \nincluding its resection margin of bronchus and vessels, and also the lymph nodes of samples 4.) and 7.)-9.) are \ntumor-free. \nThe distribution pattern of epithelioid cell granulomata is primarily consistent with sarcoidosis. \nNo asbestos bodies are found in the prepared section planes.

It consists of a grossly re izab a partial\npneumonectomy specimen measuring 22 x 13 x 5 cm. There is a firm\npalpable nodule that is inferior to the hilar bronchi and vessels.\nSectioning through the pulmonary parenchyma reveals a 2 x 3 x 1.5 cm\ntan-white mass. A frozen section diagnosis was performed on this\nspecimen. There is a row of staples in the inferior aspect of the\nspecimen. This row of staples measures 6 ctn. The specimen weighs 210\ngrams following tissue harvest of segments of the apex and base of the\nspecimen. on the lateral aspect of the lung there is puckering of the\npleural surface. This measures 1.2 x 1 cm. The mass is located beneath\nthe puckering and appears to approach the inked margin. The tumor\nmeasures approximately 2 cm from the staple margin, and approximately\n3 cm from the hilar bronchi and vessels. The mass measures\napproximately 1 cm from the pleural surface on the medial aspect of the\nlung. The non-neoplastic lung parenchyma is stained with anthracotic\npigment, but is otherwise unremarkable. Representative sections of\nthe specimen are submitted.

Soft tissue bronchial margin. \nMACROSCOPIC \nThree specimens received. \nI: The specimen is labelled \"right lower lobe\" and consists of a lobectomy specimen which measures \n135 mm from superior to inferior, 150 nun at the base from anterior to posterior and up to 55 mm from \nlateral to medial. The pleural surface is smooth. There is a stapled resection margin superior to the \nhilum. A fum nodule is palpable inferior to the hilum. Adjacent to the bronchial resection margin \nthere is a fum nodule which is relatively circumscribed . It measures approximately 18 mm in diameter \nand on sectioning appears to represent an involved lymph node with an adjacent compressed bronchial \nbranch. Sectioning of the lung parenchyma reveals a large tumour mass which extends from the hilum \ntowards the periphery. The nodule is irregular in shape. It has a cream and grey cut surface. It \nmeasures 55 x 50 x 35 mm and lies approximately 15 mm from the overlying diaphragmatic pleural \nsurface, but extends to within 3nun of the lateral pleura. Towards the hilum there is a second \ncircumscribed nodule which lies immediately adjacent to the main tumour mass. This nodule measures \n15 mm in diameter and may possibly represent an involved lymph node. A further suspicious lymph \nnode is identified within the lung parenchyma superior to the main bronchus and this measures 10 mm \nin maximum dimension. There are no other focal lesions. [lA~bronchial and vascular resection \nmargins; IB~peribronchiallymph nodes; lC~large peribronchial nodule close to margin; ID~suspicious \nnodule on superior aspect of main bronchus; lE~RS of tumour; IF~IG tumour with overlying nearest \npleural margins; IH~nodule adjacent to m~in tumour; lI~uninvolved lung.] \n2: The specimen is labelled \"middle lobe lymphatic tissue\" and consists of a single fragment of cream \ntissue which is elongated .

Sectioning reveals \nblackened lymph nodes. [The largest fragment is bisected and one half is blocked with all remaining \nMICROSCOPIC \n1: Sections show a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. The lesion is in the region of the \ncentral bronchi and extends out towards the pleura. Pleural invasion is not identified . There is no \nblood vessel invasion but lymphatic permeation is seen. No perineural permeation is identified. The \nlesion is clear of the bronchial resection margin but there is a nodule of tumour within the adjacent soft \ntissue. This is partly related to a lymph node and extends close to/if not at the inked resection margin. \nFurther levels are being examined . Several peribronchial lymph node metastases are seen. There is \norganising pneumonia surrounding the tumour and the adjacent lung shows evidence of emphysema. \nThe bronchial resection margin shows squamous metaplasia with mild dysplasia. \n2: Sections show an artery with surrounding fibroadipose tissue and nerves.

The two most common sensitizingmutations are short in4rame deletions of anon 19 (45% of all mutations )and the L858R substitution in axon 21 (40 .45% of allmutations ).Another mutation . T790M In axon 20. has been shown to cause secondary resistance to ge (ttknib, in patients whodevelop resistarx s ,approximately 43-50% acquire the T790M mutation.

Inflated, fixed upper lobe ofleft lung measuring 24 x 14 x 7 em, central bronchus resection plane located 0.8 \nem proximal to the birfurcation of the lingular bronchus. A 4.5 em long staple suture line runs in a dorsocaudal \ndirection from the hilus. At the hilus are four lesioned grayish-black nodes between 0.8 and 1.4 em. Lateral \npleural over segment 2 shows an unclearly demarcated 3 em area of whitish discoloration characterized by a \ndepression-like retraction, under which is a moderately solid, predominantly pale brownish and partly patchy \ngrayish-black tumor, max. 5.5 em in size, with a relatively clear and somewhat arcuate demarcation, extending \nto the pleura in the region of the retraction. Truncation or opening of peripheral branches of B2, Bl and B3 in \nthe tumor. Lateral pleural region at the junction of S3/S4 shows an unclearly demarcated 0.4 em area of \ninduration. Rest of parenchyma shows rarefaction in apical region of gegrnent 1 with lacunae or lacuna systems \nup to 0.6 em in size, otherwise inconspicuous. \n2.) Parietal pleura: membranous tissue measuring 10.5 x 8.5 em and up to 0.1 em thick with partly smooth, \npartly rough surface. \n3) Interlobar LN (item 11) left: three lesioned grayish-black nodes or node parts, 0.3 and 1.1 em in size. \n4) Hilar LN (item 10) left: two lesioned grayish-black nodes or node parts, 0.4 aud 1.3 em in size, partly with \nsome surrounding tissue. \n5) Subcarinal LN (item 7): 1 em lesioned grayish-black node or node part. \n6) Paraaortic LN (item 6) left: combined 1.5 em quantity of party grayish-red, partly blackish specimens \nbetween 0.1 and 0.8 em. \n7) Subaortic LN (aortopulmonary window) (item 5) left: 2 em lesioned grayish-black nodes with some \nsurrounding tissue. \n8.) Low paratracheal LN (item 4) left: 2.2 em lesioned grayish-brown node with some surrounding tissue. \nExatnined: \n1.) 2 sections of tumor with remaining parenchyma, 3 sections with pleura, indurated area (halved), 2 sections \nof apical S 1, central bronchus resection plane, resection margins of vessels, hilar nodes, \n2.)

All material (in 7. + 8. preparations lamellated), \n15 blocks, partly Elastica-van Gieson, PAS, diastase-PAS. \nMicroscopy \nDescription of histological and cytological fmdings omitted for capacity reasons. \n EVAlUATION \nPrimary diagnosis/diagnoses: \nIntermediate to peripheral manifest bronchopulmonary, histologically poorly differentiated, partly \ngigantocellnlar and polymorphocellular squamous cell carcinoma of the upper lobe of the left lung. TNM \nclassification according to this picture pT2 pNO Vl RO, stage IB. C 34.1; M 8070/3. \nSeconda1-y diagnosis/diagnoses: \nSmall tumor necroses and tumor-related inflammation. Active, partly resorptive inflammation of the lung \nparenchyma surrounding the tumor with inclusion of numerous macrophages. Circumscribed subpleural \nalveolar and interstitial organizing and remodeling zone of the lung parenchyma with inclusion of immature or \natypical squamous cell metaplasia also involving the bronchioles (83 /4). Apical emphysematous stromal \nremodeling with fonnation of small subpleural cysts. Slight anthracotic pigment deposits in the lung \nparenchyma and moderately marked deposits in the lymph nodes. Chronic parietal pleuritis with fibrosis of \nvarying degrees (sample 2.)). \nRemark/addendum: \nThis is probably a primarily peripheral carcinoma of the lung which, after central growth, has infiltrated \nintermediate or subsegmental bronchi of segments 1 -3 there, because there is tumor invasion of the overlying \nvisceral pleura, where there is also marked fibrosis. The main tumor mass is located in segment 2. The fibrosing \nlesion of the lung parenchyma in the boundary region of segments 83/4, which includes atypical squamous cell \nnests, could be the initial stage of a second bronchopnhnonary carcinoma focus, because the histological picture \nis not typical of a satellite nodule. But ultimately, the differential diagnosis of an atypical squamous cell \nmetaplasia in the context of a circumscribed fibrosing process initiated by inflammation cannot be made with a \nsufficient degree of reliability.

Ectasia of small bronchial branches peripheral to the tumor with moderately marked chronic \ninflammation. Focal, chronic organizing and focally fibrinous pneumonia at tumor margin, peripheral to the tumor in \n51/3 and 54 (sample 5.)). Soft-tissue particles with chronic fibrosing inflammation (samples 1.) and 2.)). lymph nodes \nwith uncharacteristic reactive lesions and anthracotic pigment deposits (samples 4.) -11.)). \nRemark/addendum: \nThe tumor extends peripherally to the visceral pleura in the area of adhesion with the parietal layer, there is no evidence \nhere to suggest infiltration of the visceral pleura. Over 52 there is a pleural defect; the tumor here shows a \ncircumscribed extension to the preparation surface, and a further small part of the tumor is contained in sample 3.), so \nfrom a patho-anatomical perspective a category of RX is arrived at.

The bronchial portion of the specimen measures approximately 30 mm in length and has \na bifurcation adjacent to the resection margin with two adjacent lumens measuring approximately 13 \nmm in diameter, one of which is plugged by cream to pink turnout. No palpable mass is present within \nthe lobectomy specimen. The pleural surface demonstrates mild anthracotic pigmentation. Several \nsmall peribronchial lymph nodes are present. Tumour is seen plugging the two described bronchi and, \non sectioning, is seen to involve several adjacent second order branches . The tumour appears clear of \nthe peribronchial soft tissue resection margins and does not appear to be invading lung parenchyma \nmacroscopically. The tumour extends approximatel y 45 nun along the first and second order bronchi. \n[TS of bronchial resection margin containing tumour plug and peribronchial lymph nodes, I A; TS of \nbronchial resection margin not containing tumour, inked side down, and peribronch ial nodes, IB; TS of \nfirst order bronchi containing tumour, I C\u00b7O; TS of intrapulmonary bronchi, I E; section of normal lung, \nIF; sections of tumour and normal lung taken for lung tumour research project]. \n2: The specimen is labelled \"lingular margin left lobe\" and consists of an opened strip of bronchial \nwall measuring approximat ely 32 x 4 x 2 nun. The mucosal surface appears normaL The specimen is \nnot oriented in any way.

[All wrapped and BIT, 3A]. \n4: The specimen is labelled \"mediastinal lymph nodes\" and consists of fany tissue containing two \nidentifiable lymph nodes measuring 3 nun and II mm in maximum extent respectively. [Both BIT, \nMICROSCOP IC \n1: Sections show a largely exophytic, moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma which fills \nbronchial lumens and invades down to and between bronchial cartilages to abut the external bronchial \nsoft tissue resection margin in areas. Defmite transection of tumour nests at these margins is not \nidentified. Tumour involves one of the bronchial end resection margins. There is no invasion oflung \nparenchyma. No lymphatic or vascular invasion is found, but focal perineural infiltration is noted. \nNone of the peribronchia l lymph nodes contains metastatic carcinoma, although tumour abuts the \ncapsule of one node. The distal lung parenchyma is atelectatic and contains a few scattered \nfibromuscular scars. \n2: Sections show bronchial wall lined by partly denuded respiratory epithelium. There is focal thin \nsquamous metaplasia but no evidence of dysplasia or malignancy. \n3 & 4: Sections show anthracotic lymph nodes in which there is no evidence of metastatic carcinoma. \nSUMMARY \nLeft upper lobectomy and lymph node sampling: \nLargely endobronchial, moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, 45 mm in greatest \ndimension. \nPerineural invasion present. \nNo vascular or lymphatic invasion present. \nNo lymph node metastases. \nPathological stage 1'2 NO.  cc: Lung Cancer Registry ",

EGFR-activating mutations have been shown to be significantly associated vlith response to TKls and KRAS \nmutations are associated with TKI resistance. They are mutually exclusive in NSClC. Additionally. recent data show that ALK (Anaplastic Lymphoma \nKinase) gene rearrangements in adenocarcinoma of lung are associated with resistance to TKls and have favorable response rates to Crizotinib. the ALK \ninhibitor agent currently in clinical trials, Mutation analysis for KRAS and EGFR-TK domain and ALK gene rearrangement by FISH is available as the \nLung Cancer Mutation Panel.

After attempted inflation of left lung at the deformed base measuring 10 x 8.5 em and up to 21 em in length, \ncentral bronchus resection plane located 3.5 em proximal to the bifurcation of the upper lobe bronchus. Pleural \nfissure shows a strand of obliteration. Over segment 6 and adjacent sections of Sl 0, an area of parietal pleura \nmeasuring 16 x 14 em is extensively adhesive in parts and loosely attached in parts. Dorsal, lateral and basal \npleura over segment 10 and adjacent sections of 89 show grayish-white discoloration and thickening in the \nregion of the pleural margin. Main bronchus largely skeletonized. At the hilus are four lesioned grayish-black \nnodes between 0.3 and 0.8 em in size. Lower lobe bronchus starting barely I em distal to the ostium and \nproximal parts of the lower lobe segmental bronchi, especially of the basal group, show high-grade constriction \nor obstruction by a central soft to moderately frrm, pale brown to whitish, predominantly endobronchial tumor, \nmax. 6 em in size, in the lower lobe, with relatively clear demarcation against the parenchyma, extending to \nwithin 0.3 em of the hilar resection surface. Involvement of numerous grayish-black nodes up to l em in size by \nthe tumor. Constriction and partly pouch-like puckering of central blood vessels by the tumor. Focal extension \nto the pleural fissure, upper lobe shows no macroscopic infiltration. Peripheral branches of bronchi of the basal \ngroup are markedly dilated and filled with thick mucus. Basal lower lobe parenchyma incompletely folded, \nshowing diffuse induration and patchy sections of brownish-yellow color, basal pleura over segment 9 \nquestionably retracted. Rest of parenchyma and pleura show marked patchy or reticulate blackish pigmentation. \nAt the bifurcation of the upper lobe bronchus two grayish-black nodes of I em each, and subpleural grayish\u00ad\nblack node of0.3 em in segment 4. \n2.) Pleura left: two flat or membranous pieces of tissue measuring 4.8 x 2.5 and 3.5 x 2 em, and up to 0.2 em \nthick. Surfaces partly turbid or roughened. \n3.) Interlobar LN (station II) left: l em lesioned grayish-black node or node part. \n4.) Hilar LN (station 10) left: 1.2 em node part with some surrounding tissue. \n5.) Pulmonary ligament LN (station 9) left: 1.5 em node part with some sunounding tissue. \n6.) Paraesophageal LN (station 8) left: l em fatty tissue without focal findings. \n7.) Subcarinal LN (station 7): 1.5 em node part. \n8.) Paraaortic LN (station 6): 0.8 em lesioned blackish node. \n9.) Subaortic LN (amtopulmonary window) (station 5): 0.9 em lesioned node or node part. \n10.) Low paratracheal LN (station 4) left: I em lesioned node or node part. \nII.) Hilar LN (station 10) right: 1.1 em lesioned node or node part. \n Examined: \n1.) Tumor with rest of parenchyma, with lower lobe bronchus, 2 sections with resection surface (color-marked), \nwith pleural fissure, SlO peripheral, S9 basal, S6 with pleural adhesion+ subpleural node S4, node at bronchial \nbifurcation. (halved in each case), central bronchus resection plane and resection margins of vessels, hilar \nnodes, \n2.) 5 sections, \n3.)-11.) All material (in 4., 5. + 9. halved in each case, in 7. multi-segmented), \n19 blocks, partly Elastica-van Gieson, PAS, diastase-PAS. \nMicroscopy \nDescription of histological and cytological findings omitted for capacity reasons. \nEVALUATION \nPrimary diagnosis/diagnoses: \nCentral bronchopulmonmy, histologically ve1y poorly differentiated or largely undifferentiated, large-cell and \npolymorphocellular squamous cell carcinoma of the lower lobe of the left lung. TNM classification according to \nthis picture pT2 pNI VI RO, stage liB. C 34.3; M 8070/3. G4. \nSecondary diagnosis/diagnoses: \nRetrostenotic bronchiectasis and sections of massive, partly purulent peripheral bronchiolitis and smoldering, \nresorptive and organizing pneumonia in the lower lobe. Peripheral necrosis of the parenchyma in S9 with fibrin \ninsudation into the pleura or pleural pockets and pleural fibrin exudation. In some cases massive clusters of \nbrown pigmented alveolar macrophages. Rather slight anthracotic pigment deposits in the lung parenchyma. \nIsolated slight fibrosis of alveolar septa in S6 under a pleural adhesion zone. Slight reactive chronic parietal \npleuritis (sample 2.)). Lymph nodes in some cases with only medium-grade anthracotic pigment deposits and in \nother cases with minimal anthracotic pigment deposits and reactive follicular hyperplasia. \nRemark/addendum: \nThe squamous cell differentiation of the large-cell solid carcinoma is only shown in the form of the occasional \ndetection of intercellular bridges and dyskeratotic cells. What is striking is the presence of numerous vacuolized \ntumor cells without seeing a mucin inclusion (lipid deposit?). The carcinoma shows obstructive endobronchial \ngrowth into the main bronchus of the lower lobe. The lymph node metastases only affect the lymph nodes \nlocated in the tumor area. Vascular invasion are seen not only in the small pulmonary vessels in the tumor, but \nalso in a small and medium-sized vein within the adjacent mediastinal fatty tissue next to the main bronchus of \nthe lower lobe.

Microscopic examination performed and \n             summarized below: \n \n \n    Histologic type:  Adenocarcinoma. \n    Histologic grade:  Moderately differentiated. \n    Primary tumor (pT):  Is 2 cm. in greatest dimension with no \n    extension to the pleura and no involvement of the large bronchi \n    (pT1a). \n    Margins of resection:  Negative for tumor. \n Direct extension of tumor:  Tumor invades pulmonary parenchyma with \n    no extension to pleura and no extension to main stem bronchi. \n    Venous (large vessel) invasion:  Present (best seen in slide A5). \n    Arterial (large vessel) invasion:  Absent. \n    Lymphatic (small vessel) invasion:  Present, best seen in slide A6. \n    Regional lymph nodes (pN):  Two lymph nodes are dissected from \n    specimen A.  They are both negative for metastatic tumor. One lymph \n    node is dissected from specimen B and 4 lymph nodes from specimen C \n    (pN0). \n    Distant metastasis (pM):  Cannot evaluate pMx. \n    Other findings:  There is an area of intraparenchymal pulmonary \n    hemorrhage with dropout of pulmonary parenchyma.  This is somewhat \n     no specific but is associated with some hemosiderin and thus does \n     not appear procedural to this surgery.  It could be secondary to a \n    pulmonary embolus, but no organized thromboembolus is identified \n     adjacent to the hemorrhage.  No intraparenchymal metastasis is \n     identified. \n \n    5x1, 3x2 \n \n \nDIAGNOSIS \n    A.

        "ocr_text": "HISTORY \n(R) pneumonectomy for malignancy. \nMACROSCOPIC \nFour specimens received: \n1: The specimen is labelled 'right lung' and consists of a right pneumonectomy measuring 215 mm \nsuperior to inferior, 180 nun anterior to posterior and 60 mm medial to lateral in\u00b7 the inflated state. On \nthe pleural surface of the medial aspect of the lower lobe there is an area of puckering abutting the hilar \nresection margin measuring approximately 70 x 40 x 55 mm. On sectioning, a pale poorly-defined \nfirm mass is present in the lower lobe extending from the bronchus and hilar resection margin and \nmeasuring 50 x 45 x 70 mm. The tumour is 4 mm to the closest bronchial resection margin and up to 2 \nmm from the interlobar fissure, 25 mm from the lateral pleural surface and appears to involve the \npleura on the medial aspect of the lobe. No other lesions are noted in the upper or middle lobes, the \nlung parenchyma appearing normal. Please note the lung has been sampled for research. [Bronchial \nmargin and pulmonary artery margin, 1A; hilar resection margin, IB-C; bronchial resection margin, \nID; tumour and medial pleural surface, IE; tumour and bronchus, IF; tumour to interlobar fissure, 1G; \ntumour, IH; tumour and lung parenchyma, 1I; normal lung tissue lower lobe, 11; normal lung tissue \nmiddle lobe, lK; normal lung tissue upper lobe, lL; peribronchial lymph nodes, IM-O]. \n2: The specimen is labelled 'hilar lymph node' and consists of a piece of dark brown tissue measuring \n11 x 4 x 5 mm. [Wrapped, BIT, 2A]. \n3: The specimen is labelled' subcarinallymph node right' and consists of a piece of pale firm tissue \ncovered in fat measuring 38 x 32 x 24 mm. On sectioning, there are five lymph nodes within the tissue, \nthe largest measuring 26 x 12 x 10 mm. [Large lymph node, 3A-C; 1 lymph node bisected, 3D; 2 \nlymph nodes bisected, 3E]. \n4: The specimen is labelled 'upper medial sternal node (right)' and consists of a piece of fatty tissue .. a lymph node measuring 20 x 9 x 10 mm. [Bisected and BIT, 4A]. \nMICROSCOPIC \n1: Sections show a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. In areas, there is production of \nabundant mucin by the tumour cells. A small micropapillary component is identified. Numerous \npsammoma bodies are identified within the tumour. The lesion is arising in the region of the hilum and \nis invading into soft tissue around bronchi and large pulmonary vessels. A separate deposit measuring \n1.4 mm is identified in the random sections from the lower lobe and there is a deposit measuring 0.7 \nmm in diameter in the random sections from the middle lobe. Carcinoma is identified in the random \nsections from the upper lobe but this is in a lymphangitis carcinomatosa pattern. Pleural invasion is not \nidentified. There is no blood vessel invasion but there is prominent lymphatic permeation is seen. No \nperineural permeation is identified. Lymphatic permeation by carcinoma is identified within the \nlamina propria of the bronchial resection margin. Tumour approaches the hilar resection margin. In \nmost areas carcinoma is separated from hilar tissues that in visceral pleura but in some areas the lung \nhas been transected. In one area in particular, tumour is approximately 0.5 mm from the diathermied \nmargin. Peribronchial lymph node metastases are seen. All the lymph node Cross sections appear to \ncontain at least some tumour and there is lymphatic permeation within the surrounding soft tissue. The \nlung shows evidence of mild centriacinar emphysema that is best seen within the upper lobe. \n2-4: Sections show focal to extensive involvement of the lymph nodes by metastatic adenocarcinoma. \nSUMMARY \n1-4: Right lung and hilar, subcarinal and upper 'medial sternal' lymph nodes: \nA: Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma; 70 mrn in maximal dimension. \nB: Prominent lymphatic permeation but no blood vessel or perineural invasion present. \nC: Lymphatic permeation at the bronchial margin; tumour very close to hilar soft tissue margin; no \ndefinite pleural invasion identified. \nD: Peribronchial, hilar, subcarinal and upper 'medial sternal' lymph node metastases. \nE: T4N2Ml \nF: Non-neoplastic lung: Lymphangitis carcinomatosa; mild emphysema.

Received fresh in a container labeled \"right upper \n             middle lobe\" is a 197 gm, 19 x 11.8 x 3.5 cm, portion of \n    lung tissue, compatible with right upper and middle lobes. The \n    pleural surface is tan- pink to gray- black, and mottled. There are \n    bronchial stumps averaging 1 cm in length associated with each of \n    the upper and middle lobes.  In the hilar region surrounding each \n    bronchial stump there are several gray- black soft rubbery lymph \n    nodes.  There is a 3.2 x 2.8 x 2.2 cm. rubbery pale tan lesion which \n    appears to be within the middle lobe, and which extends to within 1 \n    cm from the bronchial stump.  The lesion grossly extends to beneath \n    the pleural surface, but does not appear to involve the pleura.  The \n    pleural surface overlying the tumor is inked blue.  Tissue is \n    submitted for tissue procurement per the clinical request.  The \n    parenchyma away from the mass is spongy and tan- pink-red, with some \n    bleb form  in the upper lobe. There are no additional mass \n    lesions. . \n \n    BLOCK SUMMARY: A1 - bronchial margin, right upper lobe; A2 - \n    vascular margins; A3 - hilar lymph nodes right upper lobe; A4 - \n    bronchial margin right middle lobe; A5 - hilar lymph nodes right \n    middle lobe; A6- A10 - tumor, including relation to pleural surface \n    and adjacent parenchyma; A11,A12 - representative right upper lobe; \n    A13,A14 - right middle lobe away from mass. \n             B.  Received fresh in a container labeled \"level 7\" are six \n             slightly fragmented portions of soft gray- black tissue \n    atible with lymph nodes, up to 1.2 cm in greatest dimension. \n    . \n         C.  Received fresh in a container labeled \"R4\" are five \n             pieces of soft gray- black to tan- gold tissue up to 0.8 cm \n    in greatest dimension.  There appear to be three lymph nodes \n    present. \n             D.  Received fresh in a container labeled \"R2\" are six \n             fragmented soft gray- black to tan- yellow pieces of tissue \n    ranging from 0.3 cm up to 1.1 cm in greatest dimension.

It consists of a 740 gram right lung, measuring 23 x 21\nx 0.8 cm. Attached to the right upper lobe is a segment of chest\nwall, including four ribs, each measuring 11 cm in length. A large\nmass is present in the right upper lobe centered in the anterior,\nperipheral portion of the lobe and extending through the middle two\nribs, obliterating the ribs. Tumor extends to the inked superior\nanterior chest wall margin. Tumor measures 7.5 x 6 x 4.5 cm and is\nfleshy, white tan with no large regions of necrosis. Tumor extends\nfrom the peripherally-located mass centrally towards the hilum,\nsurrounds a more central branch of the pulmonary artery and may invade\na periarterial 0.6 cm lymph node by direct extension. No vascular\ninvasion is noted. Dissection of the hilar bronchi reveals no grossly\napparent bronchial invasion. Tumor surrounding vessel and extending\ninto one node with two adjacent nodes bisected is submitted in\ncassettes G and H. Tumor extending into lung is submitted in cassette\n1.Uninvolved lower lobe is in cassette J.

Part one is labeled 'station 7 lymph node'. It consists of a 0.7 x 0.6 x 0.3 cm irregular portion of pink yellow soft adipose tissue. Entirely submitted in one cassette.  \n 2. Part two is labeled 'station 11 lymph node'. It consists of a 1.5 x 1 x 0.6 cm aggregate of blac k soft rubbery anthracotic  \nlymphoid tissue. Entirely submitted in one cassette.  3. Part three is labeled 'station 12 lymph node'. It consists of 1 x 0.6 x 0.2 cm aggregate of black soft rubbery anthracotic lymphoid tissue admixed with pink yellow soft adipose tissue. Entirely submitted in one cassette.  \n 4. Part four is labeled 'left lower lobectomy'. It consists of a left lower lobectomy specimen measuring 15 x 13 x 5 cm. The bronchial margin is (1.6 cm diameter) and vascular margin at the hilum are grossly free of tumor. The pleura is grey-pink, glistening and mottled; a 3 cm puckered area is noted at the upper outer aspect of the lobe (inked in black). A staple line measures 5 cm in length, which is shaved and the pleura around it is inked in black. Benea th the puckered area, 1.2 cm from the bronchial resection \nmargin; a 4 x 4 x 3 cm grey- white firm tumor with ill- defined  \nborders is noted. The remainder of the parenchyma is pink- red, \nblotchy and crepitant. Multiple peribronchial anthracotic firm lymph nodes, ranging from 0.2 up to 0.7 cm in greatest dimension, are identified from the hilar area. Representative sections are  \n submitted.  \n \n5. Part five is labeled 'station 5 lymph node'. It consists of a 2.3 x 1.8 x 0.8 cm aggregate of black soft rubbery anthracotic  \nlymphoid tissue admixed with yellow soft adipose tissue. Entirely submitted in one cassette.  \n \n \nSUMMARY OF SECTIONS:  \n1A entirely submitted  \n2A entirely submitted  \n3A entirely submitted  \n4A vascular margin at the hilar region, shaved  \n4B bronchial margin, shaved 4C-4F tumor, bisected 4G staple line margin  \n4H-4I non-tumor parenchyma 4J lymph nodes 5A entirely submitted  \n SPECIAL PROCEDURES:  \nTTF1  \n Final Diagnosis performed by \n \n ADDENDUM 1:  \n Visceral pleural invasion is not seen on an elastic stain.  \n    Addendum #1 performed by \n \nElectronically signed  \n ADDENDUM #2:  \n INTEGRATED ONCOLOGY  \nEGFR Mutation  Analysis  \n \nBody Site: Lung  \n Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma  \n \nRESULTS: Positive for the L858R mutation in Exon 21.  INTERPRETATION: The L858R mutation is reported to correlate with  \nresponsiveness to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapie s in \npatients with non- small- cell lung carcinoma.  \n  COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more tumor cellularity is optimal  \nfor this mutation analysis. The sample submitted showed 8% tumor  \ncellularity upon pathologist review.  \n A frequently occurring sequence change 2361G>A (Q787Q) was  \nidentified. This polymorphism is known not to have clinical  \nsignificance.  \n Mutations in the tyrosine domain of the epidermal growth factor  \nreceptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with differential  \nresponsiveness or resist ance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)  \ntherapies. The objective response rate among patients with a  \nsensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%.  \n This assay analyzes exons 18 -21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain;  \nbased on the current literature, most  mutations in non- small- cell \nlung carcinoma (NSCLC) are expected to occur in these exons.  \nMutations present in less than 10- 20% of extracted DNA may not be  \ndetected by this method. Mutation status in a sample may change  \nduring tumor progression or the cour se of therapy; therefore, this  \nresult cannot be used to infer the presence or absence of a mutation  \nin another sample or sub- sample obtained from this tumor. \n This test is validated for non- small cell lung carcinoma. The  \nclinical significance and utility o f this test in other tumor types  \nis unknown.  METHOD/LIMITATION:  \nTissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is  \nselected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the samples, quantified  \nand amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to  \nexons 18- 21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by  \nbi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary gel  \nelectrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or  \nnegative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variant s \nor somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.  \n  REFERENCES:  \n \n \nDISCLAIMER:  \nThe test was developed and its performance characteristics  \ndetermined by LLC. The laboratory is  \nregulated under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of \n (CLIA) as qu alified to perform high complexity clinical  \ntesting. This particular test is not considered a stand alone test and should be used only in the context of other diagnostic tests or clinical work -up related to treatment decisions.  \n \n \nElectronically signed by: \n \n      Addendum #2 performed by \n \n ADDENDUM #3:  \n INTEGRATED ONCOLOGY  \nMOLECULAR ONCOLOGY  \nKRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS  \n \n \nBody Site: Lung  \nClinical Data: Adenocarcinoma  RESULTS: Wild -type gene.  \n \n INTERPRETATION:  \nNo mutations were identified at codons 12 and 13 of the KRAS gene. \n COMMENT:  \nMutations in the KRAS gene are reported to be associated with poor prognosis, and resistance to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies in patients with non -small- cell lung cancer (NSCLC). KRAS  \nmutations occur in 15-30% of non- small- cell lung cancer (NSCLC)  \npatients and are strongly associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking history.  This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene; based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low percentage of cells may  not be detected. This test is validated for \nuse in identifying KRAS codon 12 and codon 13 mutations in fresh, frozen, or formalin -fixed paraffin embedded tissue. In particular \nthe test performance has been established in samples of colorectal  \ncancer and n on-small cell lung carcinoma which harbor these  \nmutations, although several other tissues are also known to harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix, etc.).  \n Analysis of EGFR mutation or gene amplification status may provide additional information regarding this patient's probability of response to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies, if clinically indicated. See references.  \n METHOD/LIMITATIONS:  \nTissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is  \nselected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified  \nand amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13; primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel  \nelectrophoresis and fluorescence detection.

The specimen is labeled N8R and is received in formalin. It consists of two 0.7 cm fragments of red\u00ad\nbrown to anthracotic tissue. The specimens are inked wi.rastin g colors and each specimen is \nbisected. The tissue is entirely submitted in cassette A 1. \nB. The specimen is labeled right lower lobe and is received without fixative. It consists of a lobe of lung \nwhich measures 16.0 x 9.5 x 3.8 cm and weighs 269.0 grams. The pleural surface of the superior portion \nof the lobe has a mottled red to dark violet appearance and appears smooth. There is a prominent area \nof puckering and distortion of the lateral basilar portion of the lung. Adjacent to this pleural puckering and \ndistortion are three subpleural firm prominent nodules which vary from 0.7 to 1.2 cm. There is another \nsubpleural nodule in the lateral apical portion of the lung. At the hilum of the lung a staple line is \ndissected from the specimen and the bronchial margin is removed as a thin shave. There are three small \nup to 0.6 cm peribronchial lymph nodes. The bronchi are opened and there is no gross evidence of \nintraluminal tumor. Sections of the lateral basilar portion of the lung reveal a dull yellow relatively well \ncircumscribed neoplasm which measures 6.2 x 5.0 x 2.9 cm. This neoplasm is 5.0 cm from the bronchial \nresection margin. It abuts and distorts the pleural surface. Representative sections are submitted. \nSections summary: B1) bronchial margin from frozen section, B2) vascular margins, 83) peribronchial \nnodes, B4-B5) lateral basilar tumor and pleural surface, B6-B7) additional sections of tumor, B8) three \nsubpleural nodules just adjacent to tumor, B9) subpleural node anterior apical lung, B 10) uninvolved \nlung.\" \nC.

Lung Ca. \nLingular node, No. 11 node, segment oflawer lobe. \nMACROSCOPIC \nFour specimens received. \nI: The specimen is labelled \"left lower lobe\" and consists of a left lower lobe which measures \napproximately 120 x 130 x 100 mm in maximum dimension. On palpation of the lower zone of the \nlobe there is a firm to hard mass which has caused some puckering of the pleural surface of the base of \nthe lobe. The pleural surface surrounding the rest of this firm to hard area has a pale brown, slightly \nnodular, appearance compared to the normal appearing pleura. On sectioning there is a well-defmed \ngreyish-brovvn solid mass which has a mucoid cut surface. It measures 75 x 60 nun in maximum \ndimension. The tumour appears well clear of the bronchial resection margin by at least 40 mm. \nDistant lung parenchyma has acollapsed mottled pinkish-grey appearance. [lA, bronchial resection \nmargin; IB, hilar lymph nodes; lC-F, tumour with nearest pleural surface; IG-H, tumour with pleural \novc,lv\"d lung parenchyma]. \n2: The specimen is labelled with patient's details only and consists of an irregular portion oflung, 33 x \n25 x 22 mm, bearing a stapled margin, 30 mm in length. The remainder of the specimen is largely \ncovered by pleura, but on the opposite side to the stapled margin, there is a \"bare area\" approximately \n30 xIS mm. The stapled resection margin has been removed and the bare areas inked. Serial parallel \nslicing reveals lung parenchyma in which' there is evidence of emphysema but no mass lesions are \nidentified and there is no definite evidence of fibrosis. [3 representative TS, 2A-B]. \n3: The specimen is labelled \"lingular node\" and consists of three fragments of firm cream and grey \ntissue ranging from 4-11 mm in greatest diameter. [Wrapped and blocked in toto, 3A]. \n4: The specimen is labelled \"No. II lymph node\" and consists of three portions of firm grey and cream \ntissue ranging from 2 mm in diameter to IS x lOx 5 mm. [The largest specimen is bisected __ all tissue wrapped and BIT, 4A]. \nMICROSCOPY \n1: Sections show a well differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma. The lesion is subpleural but definite \npleural invasion is not identified. Special stains are being performed to confrrm this. There is no blood \nvessel invasion and no lymphatic penneation is seen. No perineural permeation is identified. The \nlesion is clear of the bronchial resection margin but there is squamous metaplasia and severe dysplasia \nat the resection margin. Hilar lymph node metastases of adenocarcinoma are seen. The lung away \nfrom the tumour shows evidence of centriacinar emphysema. \n2: Sections show marked centriacinar emphysema. Around some bronchovascular bundles, there is a \nmild chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate including lymphoid follicles. There is no evidence of \nsquamous metaplasia, dysplasia or malignancy. \n3: Sections of the lymph node show scattered deposits of metastatic mucinous adenocarcinoma. \n4: Sections of the lymph node show scattered deposits of metastatic mucinous adenocarcinoma. \nSUMMARY \nLeft lower lobe lung and lymph nodes: \nI: Well differentiated adenocarcinoma; 75 rum in maximal dimension. \n2: No blood vessel, lymphatic or perineural invasion seen. \n3: Na pleural invasion identified; clear of bronchial margin. \n4: Hilar, lingular and No 11 lymph node metastases. \n5: T2NIMX \n6: Squamous metaplasia and severe dysplasia at bronchial resection margin. \n7: No involvement of separate piece of lung; centriacinar emphysema present  Note this is an amended report. \nSUPPLEMENTARY REPORT \nThere is no invasion of the visceral pleura with elastin stains, \nT-28000 M-81403 Pl-03000 ",

The retracted pleural\nsurface is inked green. There is a single bleb at the medial apical surface of the lung. At the hilum staple\nfines are present, both superiorly, inferiorly, and across the bulbar bronchus. The lobar bronchus is\nremoved as a thin shave and is submitted for frozen section as CFS. There are scattered small and slightly\nlarger peribronchial nodes which are up to 0.6 cm maximally. Serial sections of the retracted central\n,redial pleural surface reveal an underlying pale yellow, firm neoplasm which measures 3 x 2.3 x 1,8 cm.\nItabuts the pleural surface of the medial lung and is 0.4 cm from the closest bronchial resection margin. It\n;s 2 cm from the closest interlobar staple line at the inferior hilum. It appears to grossly erode into an\nadjacent segmental bronchus. Sections of the remainder of the lung reveal slight consolidation adjacent\nto the tumor but otherwise well-aerated pulmonary parenchyma. Representative sections are submitted.\nCase Inge 3\nThis report continues ...

The specimen is labeled level 4R lymph node. Received fresh for frozen\nsection is a piece of soft, black tissue (0.5 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm). Touch preps\nand smear are obtained and the specimen is submitted entirely for frozen\nsection with the remnant placed in cassette A91.\nB. The specimen is labeled AP window node level V. Received without fixative\nis a 1.6 x 1 .0 x 0.5 cm anthracotic lymph node. The entire specimen is\nsubmitted in cassette B 1.\nC. The specimen is labeled level VI lymph node. Received without fixative is a\n1.3 x 1.1 x 0.6 cm anthracotic lymph node. The specimen is bisected and\nentirely submitted in cassette C 1.\nD. The specimen is labeled left lung. Received fresh for frozen analysis is a\n16 x 14 x 12 cm left lung. The pleural surface shows two areas of adhesions\nin the left upper lobe. The first area measures 7 x 7 cm and has attached\nfibroadipose tissue, is more lateral and posterior. The second adhesion area\nmeasures 7 x 2 cm and is located anteriorly; both areas are inked blue and the\nspecimen is serially sectioned to reveal in the left upper lobe a 10 x 4 x\n2.5 cm white-tan mass with areas of necrosis. The mass appears to invade\nthrough the pleura in both areas of adhesions. The mass is also present 1 cm\nfrom the bronchial margin and 1 cm from the vascular margins. There is only a\nrim of unremarkable lung tissue in the left upper lobe. The left lower lobe\nshows multiple nodules, in a miliary pattern, throughout the lung, ranging in\nsize from 2 to 8 mm; those nodules are confluent the superior portion of the\nleft lower lobe. No normal lung tissue is identified in this lobe. The hilar\narea shows multiple lymph nodes, ranging in size from 2 to 0.5 cm. The mass\ndoes not appear to cross the fissure. The bronchial margin is submitted for\nfrozen analysis with the remnants placed in cassette D91. The remainder of\nthe specimen is submitted as follows: D 1 bronchial vascular margin, D2\nmultiple lymph nodes, D3 one lymph node serially sectioned, D4 one lymph\nnode bisected, D5 one lymph node bisected, D6 one intact lymph node, D7 -\none lymph node bisected, D8 and D9 mass and underlying large pleural adhesion\narea, D 10 mass and underlying small pleural adhesion area, D 11 mass and\nadjacent pulmonary artery, D 12 - mass, D 13 and D 14 small nodules from the\nleft lower lobe, D 15 confluent nodules from the left lower lobe, D 16 left\nupper lobe and left lower lobe juction, D17 unremarkable lung from the left\nlower lobe, D 18 multiple lymph nodes, D 19 one lymph node bisected.\nSPECIMEN(S) RECEIVED A: FROZEN:LEVEL 4R LYMPH NODE\nB: AP WINDOW NODE LEVEL 5\nC: LEVEL 6 LYMPH NODE\nD: LEFT LUNG.
