GROSS DESCRIPTION:
e nay & ureter: Received fresh labeled eft kidney and ureter"" and consists of a 1151 gram
nephrectomy specimen measuring 25 x.15 x 9 an lndud ng dney measuring 22 x 12 x 6 cm and perirenal fat
ranging in thickness from 1 to 6 cm. Extending from the renal pelvis is a ureter (8 x 0.5 cm) renal artery measuring 7x
0.5 cm, and rend vein measuring 0.5 x 1 cm. The renal vein is free of gross abnormality at the margin. The specimen
is received with a surface disruption at the inferior pole and at the lateral aspect of the kidney measuring 6 cm in
greatest dimension through which friable necrotic debris extrudes. The adjacent fat is marked with black ink. In the
mid lower pole and corresponding to the capsular disruption is a well circumscribed predominantly necrotic mass
measuring 15 x 10 x 9 cm. The mass lies 1 cm from the renal vein margin and grossly extends through the renal Page 2 of 2
capsule and perirenal fat at the capsular disruption site. The remainder of the renal cortex is tan-brown with a well
defined corticomedullaryjunction. The pelvis and calyces are covered by smooth glistenin mucosa .The adipose
tissue is thinly sectioned, and no lymph nodes are found .The case is reviewed by , Representative sections
of the specimen are submitted as follows :Al) renal vein, artery and ureter margins en face ;A2-3) capsular
disruption two fragments per cassette ;A4-8) capsule wall, two fragments per cassette ;A9) non- neoplastic kidney;
Al 0) perinephritic fat.
At the request oM the specimen is regrossed with additional sections of the perlhilar blood vessels
submitted in cassettes Al 1-A15 under the direction ot^ ^s
MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
Sections of vascular and ureteral margin tissues do not show a neoplasm .Sections of the grossly described
lesion show a necrotic papillary carcinoma with patchy hemosiderin, and areas of variably foamy cytoplasm. Nuclear
characteristics show areas of prominent nucleoli and irregular nuclear borders. There is associated organizing blood.
Small vessel vascular space invasion is present .Tumor does not a ear to involve renal pelvis or hilar tissues.
Sarcomatoid areas are not seen In the examined sections.

Gross Description
A. The specimen is received fresh labeled ""right peritumoral fat."" The specimen consists of
multiple,. irregular, unoriented fragments of tobulated adipose tissue, which range from 1 to 3.5 cm in
greatest dimension.. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a grossly unremarkable cut surface.
No tissue is submitted to the Tissue Procurement Laboratory. Representative sections of the
specimen are submitted in 5 cassettes, Al-AS.
R. The specimen is received fresh labeled ""right renal mass, inferior margin.'"" The specimen
consists of an irregular fragment of fibroadipose tissue measuring 1.2 x 0.6 x 0.6 cm. The specimen
is oriented according to the surgeon's designation and inferior margin is inked blue. The specimen is
bisected and submitted entirely for frozen section as FSB1.
G. The specimen is received fresh labeled 'right renal mass, superior margin ."" The specimen
consists of an irregular fragment fibroadipose tissue measuring 1.5.x 0.4 x 0_3 cm_ The specimen
is oriented according to the surgeon 's designation and the superior margin is inked black. The
specimen is bisected and submitted entirely for frozen section as FSC1.
D. The specimen is received fresh labeled right renal mass, posterior margin. The specimen
consists of an irregular fragment of fibroadipose tissue measuring 12 cm in greatest dimension. The
specimen is oriented according to the surgeon's designation and the posterior margin is inked black.
No tissue was submitted to the Tissue Procurement Laboratory. The specimen is submitted entirety
for frozen section as FSD1.
E. The specimen is received fresh labeled ""right renal mass."" The specimen consists of a partial
nephrectomy with a moderate amount of lobutated adipose tissue of the renal hilum attached. The
specimen measures 7 x 4 x 4.5 cm. The specimen is oriented by a surgeon and is inked as follows:
parenchymal resection margin is inked black ,anterior adipose tissue resection margin is inked green, posterior orange ,superior black ,inferior blue.. On sectioning, the specimen reveals a roughly ovoid,
ill-defined rubbery tumor mass ,which measures 4 x 4 x 3. 8 cm. Cut surface of the tumor is
tan-red -brown, focally hemorrhagic .The tumor is bulging capsule and extends to within 02 cm of the
closest parenchyma resection margin. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted to the
Tissue Procurement Laboratory. The superior ,inferior ,and posterior resection margins are received
for frozen section analysis in separate contains .Representative sections of the specimen are
submitted in 10 cassettes as follows::

which is entirely submitted as frozen section as FSB1.
G. The specimen is received fresh for OR consult, labeled aright renal mass, frozen section
margins and diagnosis"". The specimen consists of a moderately firm„ red-brown, irregular, renal mass
which consists of normal renal parenchyma and adipose tissue measuring 6 x 5 x 4.5 cm in overall
dimension. The surgical margin of resection is marked with black ink and the renal capsule with
adipose tissue is inked blue. Sectioning reveals a soft to somewhat firm yellow- brown, necrotic,
partially hemorrhagic mass (4 x 3.5 x 3.3 cm). The mass is located approximately 12 cm from the
surgical margin of resection .Grossly ,the mass does not appear to infiltrate the capsule. The
remaining renal parenchyma is grossly unremarkable .Additional sectioning isolates what grossly
appears to be a portion of the adrenal gland measuring 2 cm in its greatest dimension ..No tissue is
submitted to the Tissue Procurement Laboratory: Representative sections are submitted as follows:
FSCi : Frozen section of renal mass with inked parenchymal margin (perpendicular section)

encapsulated perinephric tissue, 844.0 g, 19.5 x 9.8 x 8.6 cm. The specimen is inked black. The
adrenal gland is not identified.
The cut surfaces exhibit an irregular tumor mass involving the cortex and medulla in the superior,
middle and inferior poles, 8..7 x 7.6 x 7.2 cm- The tumor is variegated, pale tan-pink and soft with
smooth lobulated sections.. Marked fibrotic septation is noted. Neither necrosis, hemorrhage or cystic
degeneration is identified. The tumor invades 90% of the calyceal system and extends to the hilum.
The renal vein, artery and ureter are probe patent, and not Involved by tumor. The tumor does not
appear to invade the renal sinus, nor penetrate through the renal capsule to involve the permephric fat..
The tumor is sharply demarcated from normal parenchyma .Satellite tumor nodules are not present-
The remaining renal parenchyma is pink -tan, smooth and glistening with a well -demarcated
rtico-medullary junction, 1.5 cm thickness- The papillae are blunted. A. segment of attached ureter

The tumor cells are arranged in papillae and tubules and exhibit moderate amount of pink eosinophilic
cytoplasm- Areas of papillae formation with foamy histiocytes are present. There is a single layer of
tumor cells with luminally placed nuclei. No nuclear stratification is identified.
Immunohistochemical stains performed show the tumor cells to be strongly postive for cytokeratin 7,
and E-Cadherin, focally positive for vimentin with weak and focal positivity for racemase. The tumor
cells are negative for CO10, RCC and CD117.

pennephric soft tissue ,462.3 g ,16.5 x 9- 5x 6-7 cm overall dimension -The adr enal.gland is non -intact
and ragged, 3 x 1.5 x 1 cm_ The kidney (12.5 x 6.5 x. 4.5 cm) is firm and inked black. The inferior pole
exhibits an exophytic encapsulated nodule of the lateral aspect ,3..1.x 2 .6x 2.5 cm .Sectioned, the
nodule is pale tan, solid and smooth, with scant necrosis (5%) and focal hemorrhage. The nodule
grossly originates from the parenchyma, and does not penetrate the renal capsule or perinephric tat.
The nodule does not involve the renal pelvis, calices or pelvic fat. The renal artery ,vein and ureter are
not affected by the nodule .Located in the superior and middle pole are several intraparenchymal
cysts, containing clear serous fluid, I to 2.5 cm diameter- The cyst lining is smooth with no papillary
excrescences noted .The papillae are blunted and the cortex is 8 mm thick .An external segment of
ureter is noted (5.4 cm length x 3 mm diameter) and is probe patent .The renal vein is firm with
moderate atherosclerotic changes and appears 40-50% occluded- A 5 mm orange-yellow ovoid
calculus is identified in the renal pelvis. No constrict or dilation of the calices is identified.
Representative sections including all margins are submitted in Al-A10 as labeled:
Al: Resection margin of renal artery, vein and ureter, tangential.
A2T Representative of adrenal gland-
A3-A4: Inferior pole lesion with perinephric fat and parenchyma., bisected.

SPECIMEN (S) SUBMITTED :GROSS DESCRIPTION
1. Right kidney mass: In formalin labeled ""right kidney mass"" is a 15 x 7.5 x 6.5 cm kidney with abundant attached
perinephric fat weight 1,721 grams in aggregate. There is 3.5 cm ureter extending from the renal hilum. The kidney is
bivalved to reveal an ill defined 8.5 cm in greatest dimension variegated tan-white to red nodular tumor within the
superior pole. On cut section, the tumor grossly appears to possibly extend into the perinephric fat at the superior pole.
The lining of the renal pelvis is grey-white and slightly bosselated. Upon sectioning it appears that the tumor elevates
the urothelium and It is unclear at gross dissection whether the tumor penetrates through the urothelium into the renal
pelvis. The tumor also grossly extends into the renal artery, lying 5mm from the renal artery resection margin. The
remaining renal parenchyma is pale tan-pink with an ill defined corticomedullary junction. There is a small portion of
adrenal gland at the most superior aspect of the specimen with an orange red out surface. The gland grossly does not
appear to be involved by tumor. The perinephric fat is inked black. Representative sections are submitted in eight
cassettes as labeled: A vascular and ureter margins, B tumor to include perinephric fat, C-D tumor to include renal
pelvis, E tumor to include renal artery, F tumor to include uninvolved renal parenchyma, G normal renal parenchyma, H

Justification: The report specifically mentions a right kidney mass, which was surgically removed.

Laterality: Right
Justification: The kidney and subsequent descriptions in the report clearly refer to the right kidney.

Histology: Papillary renal cell carcinoma
Justification: The pathologist's report describes the tumor as being composed of papillary structures with fibrovascular cores, which are lined by tumor cells with amphophilic cytoplasm and large, slightly irregular nuclei with prominent eosinophilic nucleoli. These features are consistent with a papillary renal cell carcinoma.

Stage: pT3a pN1
Justification: The pathologic tumor stage is provided in the report as pT3a pN1, which indicates that the tumor has invaded the perinephric fat and the renal vein, with positive lymph nodes present.

Grade: Not provided
Justification: The report does not mention the grade of the tumor.

Behavior: Malignant
Justification: The report describes the removal of a malignant tumor (papillary renal cell carcinoma) from the right kidney, which had invaded surrounding tissues and lymph nodes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Left kidney: In formalin labeled ""left kidney"" is a 762 gram, 16.5 x 11.5 x 10 cm nephrectomy specimen with attached
perinephric fat, attached 8 cm of ureter, and a 6 cm attached adrenal gland. Upon sectioning in the superior pole, there is a
12.5 cm in greatest dimension lobulated tumor .The cut surfaces of the tumor are lobulated mottled orange-red to brown, with
diffuse hemorrhage and necrosis .The tumor abuts and elevates the renal capsule ;however ,no definitive invasion beyond the
capsule into the perinephric fat is appreciated .The tumor also appears to abut the renal pelvic /calyceal mucosa ,with no gross
invasion into or through the mucosa. No involvement of the ureter or gross involvement of the vasculature is appreciated. The
remaining cut surfaces are pink -brown renal parenchyma with a defined corticomedullary junction .The out surfaces of the
adrenal gland are mottled grey-orange to brown, with no tumor involvement .There is a 1.3 cm lymph node at the kidney hilum.

covered wi~ a mantle oftan-yellow, perirenal adipose tissue 
measuring 23 x 12.5 x 10 em and weighing 1,394 grams. The 
surface shows prominent vasculature and is partially covered on 
the anterior aspect with gray-pink membranous tissue measuring 10 
x 7 em. The ureter measures 9 x 0.5 x 0.4 eni. The anterior side 
of the kidney is coated with black ink and the posterior side 
with green ink. 
On bivalving the specimen, almost the entire kidney is displa.ced 
wjth tan-yellow hemorrhagic tumor with the ex~eption of portions 
of kidney at the inferior and medial aspects. The kidney itself 
measures 13 x 8 x 8 em. Tumor is identified outside the capsule

Right renal mass. 
Gross Description 
Received in formalin and labeled ""right kidney"" is a kidney surfaced by a moderate amount of perirenal fat 
which together total 399 gm. Trimmed of fat the kidney is 133 gm, 9.3 x 5.8 x 3.8 cm. Arising from the 
renal pelvis is a 7.8 cm in length and 0.6 em in diameter segment of ureter, a 2.2 cm in length and 1 em in 
diameter segment of renal artery, and a 1.2 cm in length and 0.8 cm in diameter segment of renal vein. No 
lymph nodes are identified in the renal pelvis and no adrenal gland tissue is identified within the perirenal 
fat. The kidney is purple-brown with a faint lobulated appearance. On the inferior pole there is a 3.5 em in 
diameter spherical nodule with a yellow-tan coloration. In this area the capsule is inked black. The cut 
surface identifies a 5.5 x 3.5 x 3.5 cm mottled yellow-tan tumor mass with focal areas of hemorrhagic 
necrosis and white fibrous areas up to 1.2 cm in maximum diameter. In addition, there are cystic structures 
from 0.1 to 1 cm in diameter. Grossly, the tumor mass extends to the renal capsule but does not penetrate 
the capsule. In addition, the tumor extends into the vein ofthe renal pelvis. The remaining renal 
parenchyma is red-brown. The surface of the cortex exhibits broad-based scars up to 1.6 cm in diameter.

unremarkable. The renal vein stump measures 1.5 em in length and 0.5 em in diameter and 15 grossly unremarkable. On sectioning, there reveals a 
circumscrioed, golden yellow mass within the lower pole that measures 3.7 x 3.0 em that Is beneath the capsular surface. The mass does not appear to 
penetrate through the capsule into the surrounding perinephric fat The surrounding cortex is brown-tan and measures 0.7 em and shows a well

The specimen is received in a single container labeled with the patient's named 'g~t kidney. The speelmen consists of a previously 
bisected kidney with attached perinephric fat measuring in total 20.0 x 12.0 x 5.0 em weighing 600 grams. The attached perinephric fat has been 
partially separated from the kidney exposing the capsule. The kidney itself measures 14.0 x 7.0 x 3.5 em. The capsular surface is gray tan with slight 
hemorrhage. The capsule has been inked. The ureter is identified and measures 7.5 em in length and 0.3 cm in diameter. The surface of the ureter is 
gray tan to brown tan with slight adhesions. The ureter is opened. The mucosal surface is gray tan. There are no lesions grossly identified, The renal 
pelvis and calices are however distorted and surrounded by a large gray tan friable yellow to brown tan mass measuring 4.5 x 4.5 x 3.0 em. The mass 
appears grossly confined to the cortex and does not appear to invade through the capsule into the surrounding perinephric fat and is within and abuts 
the capsule surface. The surrounding renal cortex measures 0,5 em and shows well demarcated renal pyramids and cortical junction, The renal artery

portion of renal vein which is bifurcated and measures 2.0 cm in length x 0.3 
cm in diameter. The ureter measures 10.0 em in length x 0.2 em in diameter. 
The external surface consists of a large amount of bosselated tan-yellow 
perirenal adipose tissue. On sectioning, a fairly well circumscribed mass is 
identified within the lower pole which measures 5.5 x 4.0 x 4.0 cm in overall 
dimension. The cut surface consists of soft, diffusely congested, red golden 
yellow tissue with scattered irregular, gray-tan, cystic areas. The solid 
tissue comprises approximately 60% of the cut surface and the cystic portion 
40%. The lesion lies subjacent to the renal pelvis and shows possible focal 
extension into the adjacent hilar fat. This focal extension is located 
adjacent to a portion of the renal artery. The mass involves 50% of the lower 
pole and also shows irregular satellite lesions composed of soft golden 
yellow-red tissue which range in size from 0.2 to 0.8 cm in greatest 
dimension. The mass is located 4.0 em from the renal artery/renal vein 
margin. The mass measures 1.0 cm from the radial soft tissue margin. The 
capsule surrounding the mass strips with ease. The remainder of the renal 
parenchyma is pink-brown with a distinct corticomedullary junction. The 
cortex measures 0.5 cm in thickness and the medulla measures 1.2 cm in

Received in a single container labeled right 
kidney is a previously bivalve right nephrectomy specimen surrounded 
by a large amount of perinephric adipose tissue and faced anteriorly 
by a moderate amount of Gerotas fascia. The specimen as received 
weighs 1320 grams and on reconstruction measures 25.6 x 14.0 x 8.5 
em. In the anterior superior medial aspect is a 5.1 x 2.4 x 1.0 em 
recognizable adrenal gland which on sectioning has a bright yellow 
cortex surrounding a hyalinized tan gray medulla. The cortex has an 
eccentric 0.7 em bright yellow chalky appearing nodule through the 
cortex in the central portion of the specimen. The margins of 
resection include 0.7 cm of grossly patent renal artery, 0.8 cm of 
grossly patent renal vein and 9.8 cm of grossly patent ureter. The 
capsule strips with slight difficulty to reveal to an organ measuring 
12.8 x 7.0 x 6.0 cm. The cortex is lobulated, slightly pale tan 
brown. The cortex measures up to 1.0 cm and is slightly granular and 
tan brown. The corticomedullary junction is poorly defined. The 
medulla is gray brown and slightly hyalinized with focal blunting of 
the papillae. The calices and pelvis at the upper pole are grossly 
distorted by the presence of a 7.8 x 6.5 x 6.2 cm lobulated tan gray 
to yellow lesion with fleshy, slightly bulging tan yellow moderately 
hemorrhagic cut surface. This lesion foc.ally appears to be slightly 
encapsulated and grossly appears to extenq beyond the plane of the 
Kidney proper, however, the le5io'n does' not appear to 'extend into the 
surrounding adipose' tissue being separated from it by attenuated 
corporal parenchyma. The lesion grossly compresses the calices and 
upper pelvis and does not grossly appear to extend into them. No 
additional gross lesions are identified. Also received in the same

is a 980 gram previously partially bisected left nephrectomy specimen 
surrounded by a large amount of perinephric adipose tissue enfaced 
anteriorly by a moderate amount of Gerata's fascia. The specimen as 
received on reconstruction measures 26.7 x 11.8 x 8.7 em. Noted in 
the superior antral medial aspect of the perinephric adipose tissue 
is a 5.9 x 3.0 x 1.3 em adrenal gland. The renal margins of 
resection include 1.3 em of grossly patent renal artery, 0.5 em of 
grossly patent renal vein, and 9.8 ern of grossly patent ureter. The 
capsule strips with ease to reveal an organ measuring 11.4 x 7.2 x 
5.6 em. This has a lobulated finely granular red brown cortical 
surface. The specimen is previously sectioned in the low posterior 
pole to reveal an eccentric 2.7 x 2.5 x 2.2 em well circumscribed 
thinly encapsulated chalky gray yellow to brown focally hemorrhagic 
lesion. On sectioning this lesion has a tan pink to yellow focally 
hemorrhagic cut surface but appears grossly confined to the capsule. 
This grossly appears to focally extend to within 0.1 em of the 
cortical margin; however, the lesion does not appear to extend beyond 
the capsule into the cortex. The surrounding parenchyma is slightly 
focally compresseq by this lesion; however, the lesion does not 
grossly appear to extend into the parenchyma. The remaining renal_ 
parenchyma consi9ts of a cortex measuring up to 0~9 em which is

Received in a single container labeled I -left kidney"" is 
a previously bisected 1040 gram left nephrectomy specimen surrounded 
by a large amount of perinephric adipose tissue and faced anteriorly 
by a moderate amount of Gerota's fascia. The specimen on 
reconstruction measures 24.0 x 13.8 x 9.8 em. The margins of 
resection include 1.5 em of grossly patent renal artery, 1.3 ern of 
grossly patent renal vein and 7.0 em of grossly patent ureter. The 
capsule strips \1i th ease to reveal an organ measuring 12.4 x 8.5 x 
6.9 cm on reconstruction. There is a lobulated slightly pale 
red-brown slightly granular cortex. The cortex measures up to 1.0 em 
and is slightly granular red-brown. The corticomedullary junction is 
poorly defined. The medulla is red-brOl<n ""Iith sharp papillae. The 
calyces and pelvis are lined by smooth gray-white mucosa extending 
into the ureter. Noted on the posterior aspect extending into the 
hilus is a well-defined 5.2 x 4.8 x 4.5 cm thinly encapsulated 
gray-tan to yellow nodule with a friable focally chalky, focally 
hemorrhagic gray-yellow to brown cut surface. The capsule appears 
grossly in~act. This lesion grossly extends beyond the plane of the 
kidney into the surrounding adipose tissue; hOi-leVer I the capsule does 
not appear to be grossly transected. The lower pole calyx immediately 
adjacent to the lesion is dilated with a 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm granular 
brOl-m-black calculus within the calyx. The lesion further appears to 
compress hilar adipose tissue and structures but does not grossly 
appear to extend into them. On further sectioning this parenchyma 
reveals a second slightly dilated lower pole calyx which has a 0.4 x 
0.3 x 0.2 cm similar gray-brown to black calculus. Within the 
parenchyma adjacent to these dilated calyces there is a 0.4 x 0.4 x

HISTORY
Renal mass
(StageIV chronic kidney diseasewith history of renal transplant)
GROSS
Received fresh in a container labeled left kidney"" is a kidney with
a moderate amount of attached perinephric fat (12.5 x 8 x 4.8 cm).
The kidney by itself (9.5 x 3.8 x 3.2 cm), weighs 78 grams. Hilar
vessels are up to 0.8 cm long, 2.5 cm in diameter. The renal vein
lumen is widely patent. The attached ureter (2.5 cm long, 0.4 cm in
diameter) has a metal clip across the lumen adjacent to the margin.
The inferior pole of the kidney has a 4 cm in diameter discrete
tumor nodule with a mottled, spongy orange gray cut surface.
Scattered areasof hemorrhage are present throughout. The tumor has
a discrete pushing margin, which produces a bulge in the overlying
intact capsule. Extension into the adjacent perinephric fat is not
apparent. The overlying adventitia margin is marked with black ink.
Superiorly, the tumor margin is within 0.2 cm of the renal sinus
fat.Direct extension into perinephric fat is not apparent. The
remaining renal parenchyma has athin, atrophic firm tan cortex (up
to 0.5 cm thick) and numerous cortical cysts containing clear fluid
and old, brown'blood. Renal pyramids are atrophic. Major and minor
calices along with the renal pelvis are lined by mildly striated
gray-white mucosa.

Renal mass
Gross Description:
The specimen is labeled left kidney and is received in formalin. It consists of a nephrectomy specimen
which together with perinephric fat weighs 446 grams. It measures 17.5 cm from superior to inferior, 9 cm
from medial to lateral, and 4.5 cm from anterior to posterior. Along the medial-superior edge of the
perinephric fat there is a intact appearing 6.5 x 3.5 x 1 cm portion of adrenal gland. Along the anterior
surface of the kidney there Is a thin delicate membranous tissue consistent with Gerota 's fascia
approximately measuring 10 x 5 cm. The central-lateral surface of the nephrectomy specimen is torn and
disrupted exposing the cortical surface of the kidney which Is bulging .Serial sections of the adrenal gland
reveal no gross evidence of tumor involvement. At the hilum of the kidney the renal artery and renal vein
are identified. The vessels are opened and there is no gross evidence of intraluminal tumor. Extending
from the hilum of the kidney is a small caliber portion of ureter which is 6.5 cm in length and 0.3 cm In
diameter. The ureter is opened to the renal pelvis to reveal the urothelium Is tan-white and smooth and
unremarkable. Sectioning through the central-lateral surface of the kidney reveals a well circumscribed
golden yellow and thinly capsulated appearing neoplasm which overall measures 3.3 x 3.2 x 2.8 cm. This
neoplasm abuts the cortical surface of the kidney but grossly does not appear to extend through the renal
capsule Into the small amount of adherent perirenal adipose tissue .The neoplasm Is 3.5 cm from the
hilum and hilar vascuiature. There is some cautery and cavitation of the renal parenchyma just along the
superior edge of the tumor suggestive of surgical manipulation .There is some hemorrhage extending
into the hilar fat. The kidney away from the neoplasm has a normal reddish brown appearance and the
cortical medullary junction appears distinct. The cortical thickness is 0.7 cm. Close sectioning of the
remainder of the kidney reveals no additional masses. The perinephric adipose tissue is dissected but no
lymph nodes are identified grossly. Also in the specimen container is an additional 7.5 cm aggregate of
lobulated fatty tissue which is serially sectioned and palpably unremarkable. Representative sections of
the tumor are obtained for research purposes. Following fixation the sections are submitted as
summarized below: Section summary: Al) surgical margin, renal artery, renal vein and ureter, A2)
adrenal gland, A3) additional sections of ureter and ureteral pelvic junction, A4) Gerota's fascia, A5-A7)
sections of central-lateral tumor and cortical surface of kidney, A7-A8) sections of tumor and immediately
adjacent renal tissue. Additional section of tumor adjacent to the renal sinus was submitted in Al 0, and
an additional section of renal artery and renal vein are submitted in cassette Al 1.^

Renal mass
Gross Descri ption:The specimen is labeled left kidney and is received without (fixative. It consists of a nephrectomy specimen
which weighs 226 grams. The kidney measures 12 cm from superior to inferior, 8 cm from medial to
lateral, and 4.5 cm from anterior to posterior, There is no grossly identifiable adrenal gland tissue. Thin
and delicate membranous tissue is present along the anterior surface and consistent with Gerota's fashion.
It is inked black. At the hilum the renal artery and renal vein are identified. The vessels are opened
without gross evidence of intraluminal tumor. Extending from the hilum of the kidney inferiorly is a 6.5 cm
segment of thin and delicate ureter which is 0.3 cm in diameter. The ureter is open and the urothelium is
smooth and tan-white. The central posterior surface of the kidney is covered by a thin layer of fatty and
smooth membranous tissue with a palpable mass bulging outward from the posterior surface. This area is
inked green, On sectioning there is a central posterior circumscribed tumor mass within the kidney which
measures 3.3 x 2.5 x 2.5 cm. It is separated from the posterior surface of the kidney by a thin layer of freely
movable membranous tissue. It is 2 cm from the renal hilum and abuts but does not appear to grossly
invade the renal hilar adipose tissue. It does not appear to involve the upper pole calix or the lower pole
calix. Representative sections of the tumor, which has a variegated yellow-tan to dark red appearance are
obtained for research purposes.. Following partial fixation representative sections are submitted. Section
summary: Al) surgical margin, renal artery, renal vein and ureter, A2) additional sections of ureter and
ureteral pelvic junction, A3) Gerota's fascia, A4) posterior surface of kidney with underlying tumor, A5-A6)

COMMENTS: 
Histologic sections from the left kidney show a unifocal tumor mass measuring 3.0 em in greatest dimension . Grossly the tumor appears to be limited to 
the kidney. However, there is an area in which there is microscopic transgression of the renal capsule with tumor extending approximately 0.1 cm into the 
perinephric adipose tissue. The tumor is not identified at the margins of resection. The tumor shows a papillary pattern consisting of polygonal to 
columnar shaped cells with enlarged oval nuclei and prominent nucleoli. Numerous clusters of macrophages are present within the papillary stalks. The 
histoloaic aopearance is that of papillary renal cell carcinoma.  .~ """" .

Left Kidney and Left Ureter 
Clinical History/Operative Ox: 
Left renal pelvic tumor 
Gross Description: 
The specimen is labeled left kidney and ureter and is received without fixative. It consists of a 
nephrectomy specimen with adherent long segment of ureter which weighs   The nephrectomy 
specimen measures 14 cm from superior to inferior, 7.5 cm from medial to lateral, and 5 cm from anterior 
to posterior. There is no grossly identifiable adrenal gland tissue. Along the anterior surface of the kidney 
is a 8 x 5.5 cm area of thin delicate adherent tissue suggestive of Gerota's fascia. At the hilum the renal 
artery and renal vein are identified. The vessels are opened and show no gross evidence of intraluminal 
tumor. Extending from the hilum of the kidney is a 26 cm segment of ureter which proximally and 
centrally has a diameter of 0.5 cm, up to 0.6 cm at the distal end. A yellow plastic stent is present in the 
lumen of the ureter. The ureter is opened and the urothelium is tan and smooth. At the pelvis friable 
tumor is present in the renal pelvis arising from the central calix. The kidney is bivalved to reveal a finely 
granular tan-white neoplasm occupying the superior pole calix and extending into the middle pole calix. 
This neoplasm overall measures 3.7 x 3.2 x 3.2 cm. It is approximately 1 cm from Gerota's fascia and 1.5 
cm from the renal hilar vascular margin. It involves the upper pole and central pole calices. The inferior 
pole calix appears uninvolved. The renal parenchyma is otherwise reddish brown and cortical thickness is 
0.6 cm. There are no obvious lymph nodes in the perinephric adipose tissue. Representative sections are 
submitted. Section summary: A1) surgical margin, renal artery, renal vein and ureter, A2) Gerota's fascia,

---------------------------------------------------------------"," Site: Bladder and kidney
Justification: The report includes findings for a bladder tumor (perineural invasion, positive surgical margin) and a kidney tumor (partial nephrectomy, staging information).

Laterality: Left (bladder), left and right (iliac obturator lymph nodes), and not provided (kidney)
Justification: The bladder tumor is located on the left side, and lymph node biopsies were taken from both iliac obturator regions. The kidney tumor laterality is not explicitly stated but can be inferred from the partial nephrectomy procedure.

Histology: Small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia (bladder), papillary renal cell carcinoma (kidney)
Justification: The bladder tumor is identified as small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and the kidney tumor is identified as papillary renal cell carcinoma.

Stage: pT1a (kidney)
Justification: The kidney tumor is staged as pT1a, indicating a small (≤ 4 cm), localized renal cell carcinoma without invasion into the renal sinus or perinephric fat.

Grade: Fuhrman nuclear grade 2 (kidney)
Justification: The kidney tumor is graded as Fuhrman nuclear grade 2, indicating intermediate-grade malignancy.

Behavior: Malignant (bladder and kidney)
Justification: Both the bladder and kidney tumors are malignant, with the bladder tumor showing perineural invasion and positive surgical margins, while the kidney tumor is a renal cell carcinoma.",,,,,Left,Left and right,,Small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia,Papillary renal cell carcinoma,,pT1a,,Fuhrman nuclear grade 2,,,,,,,,

Microscopic Description 
Sections include kidney with a sharply circumscribed, partially encapsulated 
epithelial neoplasm. The neoplasm is characterized by a predominantly solid or 
tubular growth pattern with foci of micropapillary or papilliform architecture. 
The predominant tumor cell is a small cuboidal cell with uniform, round, small 
bland nucleus and modest amounts of predominantly clear cytoplasm. There is a 
second cell population present in the lumina of the tubules. The luminal 
population consists of larger polygonal cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and a 
single, slightly enlarged oval to reniform nucleus with granular chromatin and a 
small nucleolus. The latter cells form intral~minal poorly cohesive sheets. 
There are scattered foci of foamy macrophages within the interstitium of the 
tumor. Focally the tumor extends through its thin fibrous capsule and 
infiltrates into native renal parenchyma in a broad front. Focally tumor abuts 
on an inked parenchymal resection margin (black ink, A2). In the histologic 
sections convincing extrarenal extension into perinephric soft tissue is not 
identified. 
A PAS stain is applied to sections of uninvolved nonneoplastic kidney (A7). It 
demonstrates very focal mild interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy with rare 
colocalized ischemic sclerotic glomeruli. The glomeruli are unremarkable. 
Neither crescents nor mesangial proliferation nor primary glomerulopathy is 
seen.

tissue measuring 2.8 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm. The cut surface is tan-brown. Representative sections are submitted._ 
Specimen B, received in formalin labeled perihilar renal lymph node, consists ofa 1.7 x 1.3 x 0.8 cm p._rtion fa lymph 
node. The cut surface is homogenous tan-pink. The node is sectioned and entirely submitted labeled 
Specimen C, received fresh from the OR labeled left kidney, consists of the following: 
Procedure/specimen type: Radical nephrectomy. 
Specimen laterality: Left. 
Pe$cription of specimen: The 726 gm kidney with associated perinephric fat measures overall 19.0 x 14.0 x 7.0 
cm. Gerota's fascia is hemorrhagic with fibrous adhesions. Gerota's fascia is fibrotic and 
thickened measuring up to 0.5 cm. The perinephric fat is firm and lobulated measuring up 
to 2.0 cm in thickness. Blue ink is applied to Gerota's fascia and the mass grossly 
appears to abut the fascia. The attached segment of ureter measures 4.0 cm in length 
with an internal diameter of 0.3 cm and is grossly unremarkable and not involved by the 
tumor. 
The kidney measures 12.0 x 6.5 x 5.5 cm. The kidney is surrounded by a large cystic 
hemorrhagic mass containing blood clot. The mass is attached to the kidney and grossly 
involves the renal parenchyma superiorly. Sections show a soft tan expansile solid area 
within the cystic mass abutting the surface of the kidney and slightly compressing the 
renal parenchyma. 
The renal pelvis is slightly displaced. The corticomedullary junction within the superior 
pole of the kidney is pale white-pink and compressed. Within the superior pole of the 
kidney is a portion of attached adrenal gl,md measuring 3.0 x 3.0 x 0.3 cm. The adrenal 
parenchyma shows thin brown medulla with focally thickened golden yellow cortex. The 
portion of adrenal gland is markedly adherent to the surface of the kidney and gross 
involvement by tumor cannot be definitively determined.

Adrenal gland: Also received within the specimen container is a separate portion of adrenal gland 
measuring 5.0 x 2.2 x 1.5 cm and weighing 8 gm. The cut surface shows thin golden 
yellow cortices with brown medulla. The adrenal gland grossly does not appear to be 
involved by the tumor. 
Tumor site: Supracortical, with the solid component predominantly involving the superior pole of the 
kidney and the cystic component involving the remainder of the external kidney. 
Tumor size: The cystic component measures 19 cm in greatest dimension and the solid component 
measures 5.0 cm in greatest dimension. 
Tumor description: The cystic mass involves the renal capsule with possible focal extension into the renal 
parenchyma. Within the cystic mass is a moderate amount of blood clot. The luminal 
surface of the mass is focally nodular. The cystic mass wall ranges from 0.1 cm to 0.6 cm 
in thickness. A representative section is submitted for frozen section _ 
Focality: Unifocal.

PATHOLOGIC TUMOR STAGING DESCRIPTORS: 
Histologic type and grade: Renal cell carcinoma, papillary variant, type I. 
Primary tumor: pT1a. 
Regional lymph nodes: pNX. 
Distant metastasis: pMX. 
Margin status: RO. 
Pathologic stage: I. 
Lymphovascular invasion: Not identified. 
Perineural invasion: Not identified. 
COMMENT: Immunohistochemical staining is positive for OSCAR-CK, CK7, racemase, 
and CD10. It is negative for CK20 and CD117. This supports the given diagnosis. 
COMMENT: Tumor extends to the parenchymal edge of specimen A. From pathologic 
examination alone, it is not possible to determine with certainty whether or not the 
portions of the parenchymal edge of specimen A which are involved by tumor are true 
margins or only ""specimen margins"" in which specimen B is the true surgical margin. 
Specimen B is negative for malignancy. Additionally, a substantial portion of tumor is 
less than 0.1 cm from the parenchymal edge of specimen A; this area appears 
significantly larger than the aggregate size of all the tissue in specimen B. The margin 
status in this report was given following telephone conversation with  
who stated that the pertinent specimen for establishing the margin in 
question (parenchymal margin) is specimen B.

measures 3 x 3 x 2.2 cm. The non-cortical portion of the tumor appears to have a thin delicate capsule 
which is smooth. The neoplastic tissue centrally and paracentrally focally extends to the inked cortical 
margin. Representative sections of the neoplasm are obtained for research purposes . Representative

SPECIMEN/GROSS DESCRIPTION 
SOURCE: Left partial kidney nephrectomy 
The specimen is received fresh from the OR labeled ""left partial 
nephrectomy."" It consists of a 49 gram, 4.7 x 4.3 x 4.3 cm rubbery ovoid 
wedge renal parenchyma. The intact, smooth capsular surface with thin fatty 
adhesions is inked blue and the predominantly smooth, focally coarse 
resection margin is inked black. The tissue is serially cross sectioned and 
the cut surfaces display a 4.3 x 4 x 4 cm tumor bulging the capsule and 
located less than 0.1 cm from the black inked margin. A representative 
section of the margin is frozen on one block. 
INTRAOPERATIVE PATHOLOGY CONSULTATION WITH FROZEN SECTION: ""Papillary renal 
cell carcinoma forming a 4.3 cm greatest dimension tumor, .om letely 
excised. Margin is negative for malignancy."" is rendered by -The cut surfaces of the tumor are yellow, tan, red, variegated and vaguely 
lobulated with a thin fibrous capsule. The tumor constitutes at least 90% 
of the specimen volume. The scant renal parenchyma at the periphery of the 
margin is grossly unremarkable. 
Representative sections to include all of the closest black inked renal 
margin are submitted in nine cassettes as follows: 
1. Frozen section residue 
2-9. Renal tumor with black inked margin, blue inked capsule and 
adjacent normal appearing renal parenchyma 
Note: Representative tissue is banked for possible study. Representative 
tissue is also apportioned into one vial of RPMI and sent to cytogenetics 
to hold.

FINAL SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT
Kidney;Left
Clinical History/Operative Dx•
Renal mass
Gross Description:
The specimen is labeled left kidney and is received without fixative. It consists of a nephrectomy specimen
which together perinephric fat weighs 627 grams. It measures 20 cm from superior to inferior, 10 cm from
medial to lateral, and 9 cm from anterior to. posterior. Along the anterior surface there is lobulated fatty
tissue and there is a bulging fluctuant mass at the inferior pole of the kidney. At the hilum the renal artery
and renal vein are identified. The vessels are opened and show no gross evidence of intraluminal tumor.
Extending from the hilum of the kidney there is an 8 cm segment of ureter which appears somewhat
attenuated. The ureter is opened to reveal smooth tan-white urothelium. The kidney is bivalved to reveal
a fluid filled cystic mass in the inferior pole which bulges anteriorly this cystic mass measures 6 x 8 x 52
cm. It contains amorphous brown material and turbid fluid. The lining of the cyst Is brown with patchy
small areas of yellow discoloration. The cyst is 1.3 cm from the hitum of the kidney. It appears contained
within the renal capsule and is separated from the anterior surface of the kidney by a thin layer of smooth
fascial tissue. Representative sections of the mass are obtained for research purposes. The remaining
kidney has pale red parenchyma and normal appearing medullary rays. Cortical thickness is 0.8 cm. There
are scattered fluid filled cysts within the cortical portion of the kidney which are up to 1.3 cm. No other
discrete masses are present. Serial sections of the perineural adipose tissue reveal no grossly obvious
lymph nodes and no identifiable adrenal tissue. Representative sections are submitted.
Section summary:
Al) surgical margin, renal artery, renal vein and ureter,
A2) additional sections of ureter and ureteral pelvic junction,
A3) anterior surface of lower pole kidney including possible Gerota's fascia,
A4-A6) additional representative sections of cyst,
A7) cyst and closest approach to hilum,
AB) uninvolved kidney.
Microscopic Description:
Microscopic sections have been examined. The microscopic findings are reflected in the diagnosis
rendered.

COMMENTS:
Sections of the adrenal gland demonstrate adrenal cortical hyperplasia with extensive hemorrhage and focal necrosis within the medullary component A
single nodule of clear cell proliferation which is well vascularized is noted and because of the histologic features immunohistochemical stains are
performed With the following results
RCC: Positive.
cola Positive.
Vimentin :Positive.
Based on the immunohistochemical results and the H&E findings the f e a t u r e s of the adrenal nodule are m o s t consistent with those o f metastatic rena€ a
carcinoma.

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:
Sections of the grossly identified renal tumor show
carcinoma with papillary morphology. The tumor is
characterized by multinodular growth and tumor cells with
moderately pleomorphic medium to large oval nuclei with
occasional nuclear grooves and ample eosinophilic to
vacuolated cytoplasm. In areas the papillary formations are
densely packed'and essentially solid. There is multifocal
intratumoral hemosiderin and formation of cystic nodules
filled with papillary tumor and blood. Tumor abuts the
fibrous renal capsule, but does not clearly invade perirenal
fat on multiple levels examined. There is invasion of small
non-muscularized veins in the renal sinus but no definitive
invasion of the renal sinus fat or large branches of the
renal vein.
The tumor is associated with a significant and extensive
diffuse and nodular lymphocytic infiltrate at the periphery
of the lesion that also extensively involve perinephric and
renal sinus fat, and show sheets and nodules of cells
extensively involve the remaining non-carcinomatous renal
cortex. These are monomorphic-appearing small lymphocytes,
and by immunohistochemistry are diffusely positive for CD20
and BCL-2. The same B cells are negative for CD5 and CD23,
which highlights residual germinal center dendritic cells.
CD3 and CD5 show staining in a smaller population of T
lymphocytes. BCL-6 and cyclin D1 are negative.
Sections of the omental nodule show a spherical accessory
spleen with relatively normal splenic architecture and small
periarterial lymphoid nodules. The adipose tissue
surrounding the splenule is involved by dense sheets and
nodules of the same lymphoid infiltrate with identical immunophenotype to the kidney. Thel eft pelvic lymph node
shows involvement by both metastatic papillary carcinoma and
the same abnormal lymphoid population, with near complete
effacement of residual normal nodal architecture in the

non-carcinomatous areas. Positive and negative control
slides are appropriate.
DIAGNOSIS BASED ON GROSS AND MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:
A. Kidney, left, radical nephrectomy:
- Papillary renal cell carcinoma (histologic type 2), 5.5 cm
in greatest dimension.
- Carcinoma is confined to the kidney, without invasion of
renal sinus fat, muscularized branches of the renal vein, or
perinephric fat.
- Carcinoma shows invasion of small non-muscularized vessels
in renal sinus.
- Small B-cell lymphoma most consistent with extranodal
marginal zone lymphoma, with diffuse involvement of kidney,
perinephric fat, and renal sinus.
- Ureter, vascular, and soft tissue resection margins are
negative for carcinoma.
- See
B. Omentum, excisional biopsy of mass:
- Accessory spleen, with surrounding adipose tissue involved
by small B-cell lymphoma.
C. Lymph node, left pelvic, excision:
- One lymph node, involved by both metastatic papillary
renal cell carcinoma and small B-cell lymphoma.

ADDENDUM REPORT:
This addendum i s issued to clarify the surgical margins status. This case was discussed with Dr. Per Dr.
the specimen submitted as deep margin (8) was taken from the left lateral tumor (specimen C).The left lateral tumor is not transec ted in the histologic
sections examined .Multiple satellite foci (greater than 10) are noted in the renal parenchyma surrounding the three main lesions in specimen C-E. Some
of these satellite lesions measure less than 1 mm. Therefore it is possible that the deep margin tumor in specimen B represents a separate focus of
tumorrather than a positive margin from the left lateral tumor since the left lateral tumor was not transacted.A conversation with Dr also
reveals that the upper pole tumor ( 0) was adherent to the specimen submitted as left cyst wall (A). The upper pole tumor showed a ►+ a►ea of capsular
retraction with ink focally extending to the tumor .This additional information from Dr. lakes it likely that this area of concern was the site of the
adherent cyst and therefore does not represent a true margin.
in summary, no tumor transection is noted ,however ,this patient is at increased risk for recurrence due to the numerous small satellite lesions noted.

Surgical margins free of tumor.
Electronic signature: Histologic sections show numerous foci of papillary renal cell carcinoma .Each of the resections including the left lateral ,upper pole, and lower poles
excisions demonstrate a dominant primary tumor with multiple smaller foci within the adjacent renal parenchyma .The separately submitted deep margin(specimen B )also demonstrates similar morphology consistent with papillary renal cell carcinoma. The cyst wall Is negative for tumor.
Specimen 0 (upper pole tumor )demonstrates tumor extending to the inked outer /capsular surface ,however the capsule appears to have retracted in this
area and the presence of ink at the tumor is interpreted as a retraction artifact and not a true positive capsular/soft tissue margin.

x 23.0 x 6.0 cm. The specimen weighs 1,270 gm. The kidney
itself measures 12.0 x 6.5 x 5 .0 cm. The attached adrenal glandmeasures 4.5 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm. The attached ureter measures 5.5
cm in length and has an average diameter of 0.4 cm. The kidney
has been shelled out of the perinephric fat and bivalved by the
surgeon .The perinephric fat Is inked black .The capsular
surface of the kidney is tan-brown. There are multiple small
white granular lesions ranging in size from 0 .1 to 0.5 cm on thesurface .A portion of the tumor appears to be pushing the
capsule out and this area measures 4.5 x 3 .0 x 2.6 cm. It does
not appear to be grossly invading through the capsule.
Size, appearance and location of tumor :Bivalving the specimenreveals a tan -white to pink friable mass (5.5 x 5 .0 x 4.5 cm)
present within the center of the kidney. There is an additional
small tan -pink nodule (0.7 x 0 .5 x 0.4 cm) at the proximalureter .A representative section of the smaller mass is
submitted in FSAI .A representative section of the large tumor
is submitted in FSA2.
Renal capsule /Renal sinus :The tumor appears to be extendingthe capsule ,but does not appear to grossly invade through the
capsule into the perinephric fat. The tumor appears to abut the
renal sinus ;however ,no gross invasion is identified. The
small mass on the ureter does not appear to grossly invade into
the ureter.

Final Diagnosis: 
1. Right kidney and adrenal gland, nephrectomy and partial adrenalectomy: 
-Renal oncocytic neoplasm, 12 em, confined to renal parenchyma (see 
note). 
-Vascular and ureteral margins, free of tumor. 
-Adrenal gland, no tumor seen. 
-Seven lymph nodes, no tumor seen (0/7). 
Note: Immunohistochemical stains show the tumor is positive for E-Cadherin 
(membranous staining), many cells positive for CK7, and weakly positive 
for Vimentin, whereas negative for.CDlO, CK903, and CD117 (only 
cytoplasmic staining). Special stain colloidal iron shows many cells with 
strong, granular cytoplasmic staining. Mucicarmine special stain is 
negative. Differential diagnosis includes low grade chromophobe carcinoma 
versus atypical Oncocytoma. Cytogenetic study is pending, and the result 
may assist the differential diagnosis.

KARYOTYPE: Nmmal male karyotype: 46,XY[20) 
RESULTS: The renal mass was harvested after thirteen days in culture. 
The chromosomes from twenty metaphases were counted and analyzed, and 
three of these metaphases were karyotyped by G-banding. The modal 
chromosome number was 46, and the cells appeared to have a nmmal  -· . '-

Addendum Diagnosis 
The cytogenetic analysis (  reveals a normal karyotype. 
The histomorphology is that of an atypical oncocytoma, however, foci of 
the tumor are strongly positive for colloidal iron, and many cells are 
positive for CK7. Thus, an oncocytic neoplasm with low malignant 
potential is favored, which is a borderline neoplasm between oncocytoma 
and chromophobe carcinoma.

DIAGNOSIS: Right Renal Mass 
KARYOTYPE: Abnonnal  karyotype: 46,Y,t(X;l)(p11.2;p34)[cp21] 
RESULTS: The renal mass was harvested after seven and nine days in 
culture. The chromosomes from 21 metaphases were counted and analyzed, 
 and three of these metaphases were karyotyped by G-banding. The modal 
chromosome number was 46, and all the cells had a balanced translocation 
between the p arms of chromosomes X and 1. This translocation juxtaposed 
the TFE3 gene at Xpl1.2 with the PSF gene at 1 p34. The expression of the 
resulting fusion gene, PSF-TFE3, in renal epithelial cells has been 
repotted to play a role in the development of renal cell carcinoma (please 
see the addendum to the Surgical Pathology Report). "," Site: Right kidney and adrenal gland
Laterality: Right
Histology: Renal cell carcinoma with clear cell and papillary patterns, X;1 translocation
Stage: pT2, no lymph node involvement (N0), metastasis not detected (Mx)

Behavior: Malignant

Justification: The tissue was labeled as ""hernia sac"" but further examination revealed a renal cell carcinoma with clear cell and papillary patterns, along with a translocation between chromosomes X and 1. This finding supports the diagnosis of malignant renal cell carcinoma. The stage is determined based on the size of the tumor and the absence of lymph node involvement or metastasis.

analyzed, and two of these metaphases were karyotyped by G-banding. 
Nineteen cells had a modal chromosome number of 46, and the cells 
appeared to have a nmmal karyotype. One nonclonal cell contained 
nonrepetitive chromosomal changes that included a deletion in the short 
arm 
of chromosome 3. This deletion has been reported in cases of nonpapillary

RESULTS: The renal mass was harvested after seven and eight days in

modal chromosome number was 52, and all of the cells had an abnotmal

each of chromosomes 3, 10, 12, 16, 17, and 20, two extra copies of 
chromosome 7, and a missing chromosome 21  chromosome. Papillary 
renal adenomas and carcinomas have been reported to contain a unique 
 combination of autosomal trisomies along with loss of chromosome. 
The constellation of trisomies includes chromosomes 7, 12, 16, 17, and 20, 
all of which are found in this patient' s karyotype. The literature 
suggests that tumors with tri-or tetrasomy 7 and 17 correspond to 
papillary adenomas and that tumors with more complex karyotypic changes 
are papillary carcinomas.

The specimen is submitted fresh as ""left kidney"" and consists of a kidney
removed with attached adrenal gland and segment of ureter. The specimen
has an overall dimension of 20 x 13 x 5 cm and a weight of 567 grams. The
isolated kidney measures 12.5 x 5.5 x 5 cm. The capsule is removed with
ease revealing a pink tan granular surface interrupted by a 4 x 3 x 2.5 cm
serous cyst at the upper pole. There are two ligated vessels at the hilum
ranging in length from 0.7 to 1.5 cm in length and measuring 0.6 and 0.4
cm in diameter respectively. The segment of attached ureter measures 7 cm
in length and 0.3 cm in diameter at the margin of resection. The ureter
and pelvis are red tan and glistening. Upon opening, the ureteral mucosa
is pink tan with the usual striations. The pelvic mucosa is pink tan and
unremarkable. Adjacent to the capsular cyst at the lower portion of the
upper is a moderately firm red-yellow, focally hemorrhagic, relatively
circumscribed tumor measuring 2 x 2.7 x 2.2 cm which extends to the rim of
the cortex and protrudes into the surrounding perirenal fat. The tumor
does not grossly invade the subjacent pelvis. The remaining renal
parenchyma is pink tan and unremarkable. The cortex measures 0.8 cm in
maximum thickness.
The attached adrenal gland measures 7 x 2 x 1.5 cm and weighs 7 grams.
There is no gross involvement by tumor. Examination of the attached
perirenal fat is unremarkable. No grossly apparent nodes are seen.

COMMENT: 
The specimen shows poorly differentiated malignant neoplasm with vacuolated clear abundant cytoplasm. Tumor cells 
stain positively for vimentin, pan CK (focal), CD68, RCC (focal), and negatively for TTF-1, Mel an A, S1 00, CD34, and 
desmin. The immunostain study support carcinoma diagnosis of non-lung origin, due to negativity TTF-1. The positivity 
of vimentin and CD68 is seen in malignant fibrous histiocytoma. However, the positivity of vimentin, pan CK and RCC 
immunostains suggests metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Recommend clinical and radiological correlation.

COMMENT: 
The tumor is composed of two histological patterns: the typical chromophobe celi type renal celi adenocarcinoma is 
juxtaposed to a high-grade sarcomatoid pattern. The chromophobe celi and the sarcomatoid areas occupies 
approximately 40% and 60% of the total tumor volume, respectively. Immunostaining is performed and the results will be 
reported in an addendum to confirm the chromophobe component. 
Addendum '. 
Special and immunostaining reveal that the chromophobe compone.nt of the tumor is posltiv7 for Ha.le's C~lIoid iron, EMA 
and focally for CAM 5.2. Our diagnosis is not changed by these findings. Therefore, the prevIously hsted final dIagnosis 
(see below) should be considered our final report. With this report, our st\.ldy of this case is now completed. Thank you

COMMENT: . 
This tumor has an unusal morphology with areas closely resembling clear cell type carcinoma which are admixed with 
additional more high grade spindle cell components including those with tumor nuclei that are markedly enlarged, with 
macronuclei, Irregular nuclear shapes and pleomorphism. In addition, there are areas with glandular formation, 
remniscent of an ""intestinal"" type morphology. Taken together, these are unusual histological findings.

COMMENT: 
Part 3 is composed of a nodule of renal cell carcinoma with surrounding fibromuscular and adipose tissue. There are no 
lymphocytes and no suggestion of lymph node architecture. Lymph node involvement cannot therefore be confirmed 
histologically and this nodule is favored to represent either a soft tissue deposit or an intravascular nodule of tumor. The 
deposit In the adrenal gland is separate form the main tumor mass and Is therefore considered a metastatic' deposit. The 
pathologic stage is therefore rendered as pT3b Nx M1.

A few scattered large cells with low nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio, enlarged nuclei with nucleoli, and bubbly cytoplasm are 
present, and are suspicious for renal cell carcinoma, clear cell type. Despite the atypical features, these cells, In this 
context, cannot be definitively categorized as neoplastic without appropriate immunohistochemical confirmation. The

Comment: 
The aspirates are pauci-cellular and reveal rare small clusters of malignant epithelial cells in a background of blood. Only rare 
reactive bronchial cells and sparse inflammatory cells are present. The tumor cells are large with abundant granular cytoplasm and 
well defined cell borders. The nuclei are enlarged and mildly pleomorphic with moderately Irregular contours, coarse chromatin 
and prominent central nucleoli. The morphologic findings are consistent with a renal cell carcinoma. To confirm the diagnosis and 
help exclude a primary lung tumor, we performed a panel of immunohistochemical stains on the cell block material with the 
following resulls: 
Antibody 
CD10 
Pan-keratin 
CK7

The immunohistochemical staining pattern supports the morphologic diagnosis. Positive staining for CD1 0 and pan keratin with 
negative staining for CK 20 is consistent with renal cell carcinoma. Although CK7 is often negative in most renal cell carcinomas, 
positive staining can be seen in up to 1/3 of cases. Similarly, negative staining for ReC is seen in approximately 13% of cases. 
Negative staining for CD68 indicated the tumor cells are not reactive pulmonary macrophages which can have similar morphology 
in rare cases. Negative staining for TTF-1 also rules against a diagnosis of a primary lung carcinoma. Overall, based on 
. the final diagnosis is that of metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
