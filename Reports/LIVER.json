The specimen is received fresh. labeled '\" segment 5 resection\". The specimen consists of\n604.0 gram segmentectomy resection of liver which measures 1x6.0 x 11.0 x 7.0 cm. The capsule of\nthe specimen is pink-tan to red-brown, focally hemorrhagic, and has bosselated surface. The\nparench^,anal resection margin is tan-red-brown, focally cauterized and is inked blue. The specimen is\nserially sectioned to reveal an irregular, ill-defined lobulated intraparenehymal tumor mass which\nmeasures 11.0 x 9.0 x 7.0 cm. The tumor is bulging capsule and is 1.0 cm from the closest\nparenchymal resection margin- T G tumor mass is focally hemorrhagic and necrotic... The areas of\nnecrosis range from 0.1 to -2_5 cm in greatest dimension, and occupy less than 10% of the tumor.\nRepresentative section of the tumor in relation to the closest parenchymal resection margin is\nsubmitted for frozen section as FSAI. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted to the\nTissue Procurement Laboratory- Additional sections of the specimen are submitted in 6 cassettes as\nfollows:\nA2-A5,.

However, without further clarification, I cannot be certain.\n\nLaterality: Not provided\n\nHistology: The specimen consists of a \"stony\" ovoid mass with granular brown tissue and an irregular border, which suggests a diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or another type of malignant liver tumor.

Likewise, there is a documented though rare\nassociation of DPM/VMCs with cholangiocarcinoma.The significance of this finding, with\nregards to potential causality for (or contribution to) neoplasia, is unclear in the\npathology literature.With regards to vascular invasion, scattered foci of tumor present\nin medium-sized portal/septal type veins are identified. \" Major\"venous invasion, per\nAJCC/CAP definition, cannot be assessed in this specimen.\nGrossDescription\nReceived is a single specimen cons-'---\"\"- 'airs^n and specimen container are\nlabelled with the patient' s name, .The cassette and identifiers\nare labelled with the Surgical Number\nA.Specimen is received fresh.

The surrounding, non-neoplastic\nliver shows some bile stasis, which is predominantly intrahepatocellular. There is mild bile duct\nproliferation and scattered neutrophilic aggregates within portal areas and sinusoids. These findings are\nsuggestive of a biliary obstruction, possibly secondary to the tumor. Also present are mild portal\nlymphocytic infiltrates, consistent with a mild (Grade 1) chronic hepatitis.

There is both a micro-\ntrabecular as well as a macro-trabecular pattern. Focal pseudo-acinar structures are also\nseen. There are focal areas of tumor necrosis and hemorrhage. Focal changes suspicious for\nlymphovascular space invasion are observed in the capsule(section #8). There was a single nodule of\ntumor without any apparent satellite lesions. The tumor appears to be well differentiated and does not\ninvolve in the surgical margins. The adjacent liver tissue has a normal hepatitic architecture without\nsignificant fibrosis. Steatosis was also absent.\nDIAGNOSIS\nLIVER MASS, LEFT LOBE, PARTIAL HEPATITIC RESECTION\n- HEI ATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA, %VELL DIFFERENTIATED, PREDOMINANTLY\nTRABECULAR PATTERN, 8.0 CM IN GREATEST DIMENSION\n- SURGICAL MARGINS CLEAR\nUUID:AOF69933-CBDD-492D-9564 -AEBFB2F9CE38TCGA-RC-A10S-01A-PRRedacted\nIII IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII iiiiiiillll iillllllilllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll IIIItea\nAUrIEDD UAIfILD\n- wewerl:Z -\nI",

The specimen consists of a 1050 g, 15 x 15 x\n15 cm partial hepatectomy specimen, portions of which have been sampled for frozen section and given to\nTissue Procurement. The margin of resection has been inked in black. The hepatic surface is generally\nsmooth and glistening with a 10.5 x 6.0 cm portion of adherent diaphragm and parietal pleura. Serial\nsectioning reveals a 12 x 10 x 10 cm, fairly well-circumscribed, yellow/tan mass with large areas and\nnecrosis and hemorrhage noted. The mass has a vaguely nodular character along with occasional fibrous\nseptations noted. The mass appears to come within 0.3 cm from the inked surgical margin.

Within container E is a 3.5 x 1.5 x\n1.0 cm, roughly triangular portion of gray/purple soft tissue with a stapled edge. Two fairly well\ncircumscribed, variegated, white/red nodules are noted in the lung parenchyma measuring 0.4 and 0.3 cm in\ngreatest dimension. The specimen is serially sectioned and entirely submitted.\nE1 - portion of lung closest to stapled margin\nE2,E3 - remaining specimen\nContainer F is additionally labeled \"face of right lower lobe\".

It holds a 2 x 1 x 0.8 cm, single, irregularly-\nshaped, black/tan soft tissue fragment. G 1\nLight Microscopy:\nLight microscopic examination is performed.\nSections of the gallbladder show chronic cholecystitis with cholesterolosis. The cystic structure noted adjacent to gallbladder lumen and examined by frozen section is grossly unconnected to the lumen of the\ngallbladder and unlike the gallbladder mucosa is not stained with bile. It consists of a round cystic structure\nlined by columnar epithelium and completely surrounded by a thick smooth muscle wall. The\nlining mucosa in multiple foci concentrically around the lumen penetrates the wall in a Rokatansky-\nAschoff-like pattern.. These features are consistent with a gallbladder duplication cyst. Sections of the liver\ntumor show a tii atel^idifterentlated epatocellular carcinoma with large numbers of PAS-positive\nalpha-l- antitrypsin inclusions. Trichrome and reticulin stains demonstrate biliary fibrosis\nin the adjacent parenchyma. The iron stain is non-contributory. Tumor infiltrates the inferior surface of the\ndiaphragm with some destruction and fibrosis of skeletal muscle of the diaphragm. However, the\ndiaphragm is not penetrated by tumor.\nThe right lower lobe of the lung, on the immediately adjacent diaphormatic surface shows striking\nmesothelial proliferation, but no tumor is identified.\nThe three lymph nodes submitted show reactive hyperplasia but no evidence for metastatic hepatocellular\ncarcinoma.\nI have personally conducted the evaluation of the above specimens and have rendered the above\ndiagnosis(es).",

The appendix\nranges from 1.5 cm in diameter proximally and 0.7 cm in diameter\ndistally. The outer surface of the appendix is tan, glistening\nand smooth. At the appendiceal orifice there is a 1.9 x 1.5 x\n1.3 cm brown soft friable polyp. The polyp comes to within 1.0\ncm away from cecal margin. Further sectioning reveals that the\npolyp has a stalk measuring 0.5 cm in length and 0.5 cm in\ndiameter. The polyp appears mucosal based. The cecal mucosa is\ntan/yellow and glistening. The remainder of the appendix is void\nof luminal contents with the mucosa appearing pale, tan with\nfocal areas of hemorrhage with a wall thickness of 0.2 cm.

Tissue was received with a stitch on one side and is\nbrown and smooth and inked blue. The opposite side is brown with\nfocal areas of cauterization and inked black. Sectioning reveals\nbrown unremarkable liver parenchyma. The specimen is entirely\nsubmitted in block El-E6,\nLight Microscopy:\nLight microscopic examination is performed by Dr.\nThe sections show hepatocellular carcinoma involving the portal\ntract margin (Bl), the surgical margin in specimen B and also\nthe separately submitted medial (specimen D) and anterior\nmargins (specimen E). The carcinoma is detached in specimen D\nand uninked; therefore, the carcinoma in this specimen cannot be\noriented as to old versus new margin in specimen D. In specimen\nE.the carcinoma involves both the old and the new margin.\nStains are performed on the portal tract margin (B1) and the\ncarcinoma in this section is positive for glypican 3 and shows\nwidened trabeculae by reticulin staining. The\nimmunohistochemistry is supportive of portal tract margin\ninvolvement in Specimen B.\nThe hepatocellular carcinoma abuts capsule with an overlying\nfibrous serosal adhesion, reactive mesothelial cells and\nhemosiderin laden macrophages. Immunohistochemistry is performed\non the section with capsule (B4). HEPAR-l is negative within the\nfibrous adhesion and calretinin highlights reactive mesothelial\ncells. The carcinoma abuts capsule; but no diagnostic\ninvolvement of capsule is identified. The hepatocellular carcinoma shows both trabecular and\npseudoglandular (acinar) architecture. Immunohistochemistry is\nperformed on a representative section of carcinoma (B5). HEPAR-1\nstains a subset including the gland forming areas.\nGlypican 3 is positive. CK7 is positive in a subset including\nboth the glandular and non-glandular architecture. CD5 is\nnegative. The findings are consistent with a hepatocellular\ncarcinoma with areas of pseudoglandular architecture. No\nadenocarcinoma (cholangiocarcinoma or metastatic colorectal\ncarcinoma) is identified.\nThe background liver is cirrhotic with mild steatosis (< 10%,\npredominately macrovesicular). No definite active\nsteatohepatitis is identified. Special stains are performed on\nthe representative uninvolved liver (B8). Reticulin and\ntrichrome highlight stage 4 fibrosis. Iron highlights scattered\niron within hepatocytes and mostly within Kupffer cells. PASD\nstains macrophages in sinusoidal areas,and is negative for\nalpha-1 antitrypsin particles.\nIn the cecal margin block of specimen A (A2) there is apparent\ndetached benign appearing liver tissue. HEPAR-1 is positive in\nthese detached fragments confirming liver in this section. This\nmay represent floater versus adhesion to liver.

ADDENDA:\nAddendum\nMolecular Anatomic PathologyTesting:\nBlock 3A, microdissection target 1 (TI):\nA. Lose of heterozygosity is IDENTIFIED at chromosomeSq (371).B.

Fractional Allelic Loss is 8%(1 locus with loss/12 informative loci).\nNote;\nLON of high amplitudeis considered when more than 75% of cellular DNA is affected.\nLoss of heterozygosity of tumor suppressor gene alleles is knownto occur inliver neoplaeias and to correlate with tumor progression. As reported in theliterature, benign neoplasms (hepatic adenoma and focal nodular hyperplasia)typically have low frequency of LOH (mean tractional allelic lose -61) and hepatocellular carcinomas (BCC) frequently have higher prevalence of LOX (meanfractional allele loss -301) (1,2). Some studies have shown that MCC with\nPAL of 430% are associated with indolent biological behavior and PAL of >30%with an aggressive biological behavior (3-5). LOU mutations are reported ashigh amplitude when more than 754 of cellular DNA is affected.Some HCC with low amplitude LOX mutations and PAL 25 -35 4 considered to be indeterminatebiological behavior .However,not all tumors reveal such a correlation and,therefore , the LOH profileshould be interpreted in the context of thecytologicand histologic findings and the patient'a clinical history.Sample Preparation and LOH Analysis\nManual microdissection of the tissue sample was performed to include tumor\ntissue and normal adjacent tissue if available)or a blood sample. DNA wasisolated using standard laboratory procedure.Specimens with the minimum of\nS0% of tumor cells in a microdisseetion target are accepted for the analysis.\nOptical density readings were obtained.\nEighteen microsatellite markers (listed below )that have been previously foundto be involved in liver neoplasia and/or co-localize with known tumor\nsuppressor genes were used for analysis.FCR was performed using\nfluorescently labeled primers and the products of amplification were detected\nusing capillary electrophoresis on A613730 platform .Relative fluorescence was\ndetermined for individual alleles and the ratio of peaks was calculated\n. Normal tissue was examined to determine whether the\npatient is heterozygous at the marker (genetically informative )and neoplactic\ntissue was then analyzed to detect lose of heterozygosity .Thresholds for\nsignificant allelic imbalance were determined using normal(non-neoplastic)\nspecimens for every marker .Loss of heterozygosity was determined using (NL /Na)! (TL /TS) formula and reported when allelic ratio for a particular marker\nwas below 0.5 or above 2.0. when normal tissue was not available ,peak height\nratios falling outside of 2 We beyond the mean for each polymorphic allele\niparngwere assessed asshowing lose of heterozygosity.\nD13407 1p36 - CMtI/RIZ\nD1S171 1p36 CMM/RIZ\nD3S1539 3p26 VHL/OGGl\n035516 3p26 VHL/OGGI\nD5S1384 5g23 APC\nDSS6IS Sg23 APC\nD89254 8p22 ---\n033261 0p22 ---\n093251 9p21 CDM:N2A\n0981748 9p23 CDIO 2A\nD10S520 1Og23 PTEN\nDLOSII73 1Og23 eTXN\n0178974 17p13 TP53\n01791269 17p13 TP53\nD17S1877 17q23 Her2/neu\nD18S487 18g21 DCC\nD21S1256 21g22 ETS2\nD22S268 22g13 NF2i\"'Y %mo, Site\n11PM Dlsuepanry\n',la Mai{nancy N / NSto\nP rim\n:aa I:lr;rrcle):\nI.-e, In\n1.

However, specific values for PAL are not given.\n\nBehavior: Based on the PAL values mentioned in the text, it can be inferred that the tumor with a PAL of 430% or more has an aggressive biological behavior, and a PAL between 25-35% is considered indeterminate for biological behavior. However, specific information about the tumor's behavior is not provided.\n\nTherefore, the answers are:\n\nSite: Liver neoplasia (inferred)\nLaterality: Not provided\nHistology: Hepatic adenoma or hepatocellular carcinoma (inferred)\nStage: Not provided\nGrade: Not explicitly stated\nBehavior: Indeterminate or aggressive (based on PAL values, but not specifically mentioned for this tumor)."

Laterality: Not provided in the report.\n3. Histology: The histological diagnosis is adenocarcinoma, as stated in the \"Histological Diagnosis\" section of the report.\n4. Stage: The pathological stage is pT3 No M0, which indicates that the tumor has grown into the surrounding tissues but has not spread to distant sites or lymph nodes.\n5. Grade: The grade of the tumor is not explicitly mentioned in the report; however, it can be inferred to be moderately differentiated based on the description \"moderately well-differentiated adenocarcinoma\" found in the IRS Approval section.\n6. Behavior: The behavior of this tumor is malignant, as it is an invasive cancer that can spread to other parts of the body.\n\nJustification: These six categories are chosen because they provide essential information about the tumor's characteristics and help guide treatment decisions.

Portal areas show intact bile ducts with mild\nnonspecific lymphocytic inflammation and several bile duct\nhamartomas (von Meyenburg complexes). Acinar parenchyma shows\nmarked, nearly panacinar, steatosis that is accompanied by only\nrare ballooned hepatocytes and very spotty lymphohistiocytic\ninfiltrates. There is no well-formed Mallory's hyaline. Iron\nand PAS-D stains are negative.

Many of these contain\nmild to moderate lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrates. Some\nalso contain granulomatous inflammation. The latter does not\nappear to be directed at bile ducts. There is no significant\ninterface activity. The lobular parenchyma demonstrates severe,\npredominantly\nmacrovesicular steatosis. Lobular inflammation, occasional\nneutrophils, occasional microgranulomas, and hepatocyte\nballooning are seen. A trichrome stain confirms the presence of\nperiportal and focal bridging fibrosis. The iron stain is\nnegative for hemosiderosis.\nResults of GMS and Auramine-rhodamine stains will be reported\nas an addendum.

The resection margin\nis negative for tumor (tumor free margin, 0.5 cm). Macroscopic\nlarge vessel (venous) invasion is absent. Microscopic (small\nvessel) invasion is absent. No regional lymph nodes are identified.\nThe surrounding non-neoplastic hepatic parenchyma shows no\nsignificant diagnostic abnormality (see comment).\nPathologic staging based on available surgical pathology material\n(AJCC 7th edition): \u2022pT3a.\nComment: The sections of the large mass present in segments II and\nIII (part A) demonstrate a well differentiated neoplasm with bland\ncytology that shows loss of the normal reticulin network and\ndispersion of the neoplastic cells by an intercellular material\nsuggestive of mucin. The reticulin network is preserved in the\nsurrounding liver parenchyma. A glypican 3 stain is negative in the\nneoplastic cells and is noncontributory. The separately submitted\nwedge resections from segment VI, segment VIII, and segment IVB show\nsmaller nodules with similar histologic features. No defined lesion\nis identified in the liver segment VII.\nThe overall features including loss of the reticulin network and the\nmultifocality suggest, although the cytologic features are bland and\nwell differentiated, that this represents a well differentiated\nhepatocellular carcinoma.\nCase seen with\nAdditional reticulin stains will be performed on parts C and E as\nwell as a mucicarmine stain performed on part A. These stains will\nbe reported in an addendum, when available.\nB.Gallbladder, cholecystectomy: Mild chronic cholecystitis.\nC.Liver, segment VI, resection: Well differentiated\nhepatocellular carcinoma, forming a 1.2 x 1.1 x 0.8 cm nodule, 0.9\ncm from the surgical resection margin.\nD.Liver, segment VII, resection: Hepatic tissue with cautery\neffect.

There is a\nfaint pink blush in the dilated sinusoids, but no intracellular\nmucin is identified.

Right lobe of liver, partial resection: Tumor at margin.\nB. Right lobe of liver, additional margin: Margin negative\n(superior).\nGROSS DESCRIPTION\nA. The specimen is received fresh for frozen section and\ntissue procurement labeled \"right lobe of liver\" and\nconsists of a 493 gram, 14.0 x 11.0 x 5.5 cm. partial hepatectomy\nspecimen described as \"right lobe\". The cauterized parenchymal\nmargin measures 13.0 x 6.2 cm. There is a large obvious gross tumor\nmass opposite to that margin. A double suture is present at one\naspect and a frozen section of that area is requested. The\nparenchymal margin is inked black; a fleshy yellow to tan nodular\nirregular area consisting of tumor mass which measures 9.0 x 12.0 x\n6.0 cm. Abutting.this mass are other irregular tumor nodules which\nmeasure a combined 3 cm. in greatest dimension. Separate from the\nlargest mass is a 2 cm. nodule which is present directly at the\nsuture which was requested for frozen section. A representative\nsection of that margin with attached tissue is submitted for frozen\nsection as frozen section AFS-1. Representative sections of tumor\nand normal are submitted for tissue procurement. Representative\nsections are submitted in 10 blocks as labeled.\nBLOCK SUMMARY: 1-3 - Tumor to inked resection margin; 4-6 - tumor\nto capsular surface; 7-9 - tumor to normal parenchyma; 10 - random\nnormal parenchyma.\nPlease note, photographs are taken.\nB. Received fresh labeled \"additional lobe of liver\" is a\n670 gram, 14.0 x 4.0 x 4.5 cm. hepatectomy specimen with a\ndouble long suture oriented as superior and a single long stitch\noriented as anterior which is hepatic capsular surface. The double\nlong stitch margin is inked black and the inferior side is inked red\nfor orientation. That inferior side represents the tissue adjacent\nto specimen A. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal pale\ntannish areas adjacent to the prior resection which may represent\nresidual tumor. The area adjacent to the single long stitch\ndesignated anterior is inked orange. The superior margin is sampled\nin frozen sections 1 and 2 and the area adjacent to the stitch\ndefined as anterior margin which appeared more capsular is submitted as representative frozen section AFS3. Representative sections\nafter fixation. RS8. Representative sections are submitted for\nfrozen section with blocks BFS1 and BFS2 representing the new\nsuperior margin and BFS3 representing the \"single stitch anterior\nmargin\" which appears to be hepatic capsule.

The final resection margins of part B\nare negative.\nVascular invasion: Lymphatic space invasion is identified in block\nA7 and A5. No large vessel invasion is identified.\nRegional lymph nodes (pN): Not evaluated, pNx.\nDistant metastasis (pM): Not evaluated, pMx.\nOther findings: Special stains and immunohistochemical stains were\nevaluated on block Al. The tumor showed the expected loss of\nreticulin staining that one sees in hepatocellular carcinoma. The\ntumor showed the usual canalicular spotty staining with CEA. The\ntumor cells were completely negative for CK7, CK20 and CK8. The\ntumor cells were also negative for HepPar 1.\nAlthough HepPar 1 is usually positive in hepatocellular carcinoma,\nhigher grade tumors can be negative and that is the finding in this\ncase.\nThe background hepatic parenchyma shows findings of steatohepatitis\nwith approximately 30-40% mixed micro- and macrosteatosis with\nchronic inflammation in the portal areas and mild chronic\ninflammation within the hepatic lobules. Overall, the findings are\nthose of moderate steatohepatitis. Stage I fibrosis is noted in the\nbackground hepatic parenchyma. No iron accumulation is identified.\nNo PAS positive diastase resistant alpha-1 antitripsin globules are\nidentified. Iron, PAS, PAS with diastase, reticulin and trichrome\nstains were evaluated on a representative normal tissue block (A10).\nDr. also reviewed selected slides and concurred with the\ndiagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma and grade 3 interpretation.\nOf note, no definitive additional tumor was identified in specimen\nB. Cautery artifact was noted in the areas which were considered\ngrossly suspicious for some residual tumor, but no definitive\nresidual tumor was identified microscopicly, even though some\nadditional sections were evaluated.\n4x2, 14x2, 15x3, 18x5, 20x5 [A few of the antibodies used in our laboratory may be classified as\nanalyte specific reagents.

Tumor is present in blocks 1-5 and 7-12.\nSections of the tumor demonstrate hepatocellular carcinoma with\nvariable features. There are areas with solid and trabecular growth,\ntypical of hepatocellular carcinoma, and some areas with desmoplastic\nstroma and a suggestion of glandular growth. Some areas are well\ndifferentiated (grade 2) while others are moderately (grade 3) and\npoorly differentiated (grade 4) with anaplastic giant cells and\nnumerous mitotic figures. Some areas have tumor cells with cytoplasmic\nfat, and some areas have hyaline globules. The surgical margins are\nnegative, but the satellite nodule noted grossly (block 3) is within 1\nmm of the inked margin. The immunostain results support the diagnosis\nof hepatocellular carcinoma.\nSPECIAL STAINS: -------------------------------------------\nImmunostains (blocks 1 and 5):\nAlpha fetoprotein Strongly positive\nGlypican-3 Strongly positive\nPolyclonal CEA Canalicular staining predominantly\nHepPar-1 Variable patchy positivity\nCytokeratin 8 Positive in majority of tumor\nCytokeratin 7 Variable positivity, 10 to 25% of tumor cells\nCytokeratin 19 A few areas of positivity, most of tumor negative\nEMA Scattered positivity, <2% of tumor cells\nMOC-31Patchy positivity, 25 to 50% of tumor\nPRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: -----------------------------\nLiver lesion\nPOST-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: ---------------------------\nSame, pending pathology\nCLINICAL INFORMATION: ---------------------------------\nNone provided\nSPECIMEN:\nGALLBLADDER, PORTION OF LIVER ----------------------------------\nGROSS DESCRIPTION: -------------------------------------\nThe specimen is received in one part and is labeled with the patient's\nname and \"portion of liver and gallbladder.\" The\nspecimen consists of a portion of liver with attached gallbladder. The\nportion of liver measures 8.0 x 5.5 x 3.5 cm. The capsular surface is\ntan-white and bosselated. The resection surface is inked black, and\nthe specimen is serially sectioned. The specimen consists of a\nwell-defined, irregular tan-white nodule, measuring about 4.0 x 4.0 x\n3.0 cm.The nodule is composed of tan-white firm tissue and is 0.3 cm Patient\nMRN\nDOB\nDate of Service\nPerforming Facility .. ..\nOrdering Provider\nResult Provider\nReport Name :Surgical Report\nStatus :F XRequested by:\nto the closest resection margin.The small separate nodule is 0.3 cm\naway from the larger nodule. The remaining specimen shows tan-brown\nunremarkable hepatic parenchyma. The attached gallbladder measures 7.5\ncm in length x 3.0 cm in diameter. The cystic duct measures 0.1 cm in\nlength x 0.3 cm in diameter. The serosal surface is smooth and\ncongested. One lymph node, measuring 1.0 cm in length is identified\nadjacent to the cystic duct. The mucosal surface is bile stained\nwithout ulceration. The lumen contains dark green bile without\ncalculi. The gallbladder wall measures 0.1 cm in thickness.\nRepresentative sections are submitted in six cassettes as follows:\ncassette 1 - larger nodule with resection margin: cassette 2 - nodule\nwith external adherent gallbladder wall: cassette 3 - small separate\nnodule with surgical margin; cassettes 4 and 5 - random sections of\nlarger nodule; cassette 6 - gallbladder and lymph node.\nAdditional se ctions are submitted in six cassettes, labeled cassettes 7\nthrough 12.\n<Sign Out Dr. Signature>\nMED REC #:",
        "llm_output": " Site: Liver\n\nLaterality: Not provided in the given report.\n\nHistology: Hepatocellular carcinoma. This diagnosis is based on the microscopic description and special stains that support the presence of hepatocellular carcinoma, such as strong positivity for alpha fetoprotein and glypican-3.\n\nStage: pT2 (AJCC 8th edition)\nThe pathologic stage is determined based on the pathological tumor category (pT), regional lymph nodes (pN), and distant metastasis (pM). The given report mentions that there is no evidence of regional lymph node involvement or distant metastases. However, the tumor has invaded blood vessels (lymphovascular invasion) and is larger than 2 cm in greatest dimension, which classifies it as pT2.\n\nGrade: The report mentions that some areas of the tumor are well differentiated (grade 2), while others are moderately (grade 3) and poorly differentiated (grade 4). Therefore, a specific grade cannot be assigned based on this information alone.\n\nBehavior: Malignant\nHepatocellular carcinoma is a malignant tumor with the potential to invade surrounding tissues and metastasize to distant organs."

The smooth capsular\nsurface displays an 11.5 x 8 x 7 cm bosselated tan tumor bulging from its\nexternal surface. The margin is inked blue and the tissue is serially cross\nsectioned.\nINTRAOPERATIVE PATHOLOGY CONSULTATION: \"Tumor grossly 1 cm from cauterized\nmargin\" is rendered by\nThe tumor has variegated, lobulated, yellow, tan, pink and brown cut\nsurfaces with predominantly well-defined edges. The tumor grossly abuts the\ngallbladder bed. Extension through the capsule and into the gallbladder bed\nis not seen. No other lesions are seen on the red-brown hepatic parenchyma.\nThe attached 8.7 cm in length and 3 cm in diameter intact distended\ngallbladder has smooth glistening serosal surfaces which are mildly\nedematous .Received within the gallbladder lumen are numerous 0.8 cm in\naverage diameter dark green, black multifaceted choleliths aggregating to\n6.5 x 4.5 x 0.7 cm. On opening the mucosa displays two components. One\ncomponent extending to the cystic duct margin for a length of 2 cm is\nred-tan and velvety. The remaining component of the mucosa is pink-tan,\nflat to velvety with a slightly thickened wall up to 0.2-0.3 cm thick and\nmeasuring approximately 1.8 cm in greatest dimension. The remaining mucosa\nat the body and fundus is tan with thin trabeculations.\nRepresentative sections are submitted in eight cassettes labeled:\n1-2. Liver tumor with closest blue-inked margin\n3-4.

The overall patterns are a combination of\ntrabecular and pseudoglandular. The nuclei are slightly enlarged and mildly\npleomorphic, however, the cells still have abundant cytoplasm. This would\ncorrespond to a tumor grade of 2. One large nodule is present measuring 9.8\ncm in maximum dimension. The gross appearance would correspond to the diffuse\ntype. The tumor is 0.7 cm from the nearest surgical resection margin. There\nis moderate fibrosis within the tumor. Angiolymphatic invasion is not\nidentified in these sections. Mitotic rate is 6/10 HPF.

The specimen consists of an intact gallbladder measuring 8.3 c 2.4 x 2.6\ncm. The serosal surface is smooth. The lumen contains green bile and no\ncalculi, and the cystic duct is patent. The mucosa is granular, and the wall\naverages 0.2 cm in thickness. The cystic duct lymph node is not identified.\nRepresentative sections are submitted in one cassette.\nPLEASE NOTE: There is also a 0.5 cm polyp identified on the mucosa which has\nbeen sampled in the cassette.\nB. The specimen is received fresh and is submitted in formalin. The specimen\nconsists of a segment of liver measuring 13 x 6.9 x 3.7 cm. The resection\nmargin is dyed with black ink. Grossly on the liver surface, there is a\ngrossly identifiable light tan nodule which grossly appears to invade the\nliver capsule. Upon sectioning through this portion, there is a grossly\nidentifiable tumor measuring 2.5 x 2.2 x 2.1 cm. This lesion has a nodular\nappearance and comes to within 1.0 cm of the surgical resection margin. The\nremainder of the specimen is sectioned and reveals no more gross\nabnormalities. Representative sections of the tumor including the grossly\ndeepest point of invasion to the resection margin and the invasion to the\nliver capsule are submitted in blocks B1 to B5. Representative sections of\ngrossly unremarkable liver parenchyma are submitted in block B6.\nMICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:\nThe gallbladder wall appears thin. The mucosa shows a polypoid lesion\nconsisting of aggregates of foamy histiocytes covered by intact mucosa,\nconsistent with a cholesterol polyp. There is no dysplasia. No significant\ninflammation is present. The cystic duct is unremarkable.\nThe liver mass shows features of a hepatocellular carcinoma. The tumor has a\nlobulated border with the adjacent hepatic parenchyma. The tumor cells are\narranged in solid sheets, acinar formations and trabeculae. Their cytoplasm\nvaries from eosinophilic to clear, and the nuclei show moderate to severe\ncytologic atypia, with some areas of the tumor demonstrating marked nuclear\npleomorphism and prominent mitotic activity. Coarse fibrous septae are noted\nbetween the lobules of tumor, but no satellite nodules are noted in the\nadjacent parenchyma. No vascular invasion is identified. The. adjacent\nparenchyma shows moderate microvesicular and macrovesicular steatosis and\nevidence of chronic hepatitis, including chronic portal inflammation with\ninterface hepatitis, and lobular inflammation with hepatocyte dropout. There\nis also anisocytosis and anisonucleosis. Trichrome stain reveals evidence of\nperiportal fibrosis with some bridging, but no evidence of established\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFINAL Page 2 * * * CONTINUED LABORATORY SERVICES\nAccession #:\nName:\nPatient ID:\nPHN:\nALT ID :\nDOB:\nTelephone:\nRequesting Physician:\nEncounter:\nChart ID:\nHISTOPATHOLOGY REPORTDivision Head: Dr.\nInquiry Numbers:\nMICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:\ncirrhosis.\nImmunohistochemistry was performed on the tumor and reveals it to be positive\nfor CAM 5.2, HEP PAR-1 (patchy) and alpha fetoprotein (focal); there is very\nweak/equivocal staining with cytokeratin 7 and no staining with cytokeratin\n20, synaptophysin or TTF1 (non-specific cytoplasmic staining only).\n--------------------------------------------------------------\nProcedure:\nFINAL Page 3 * END OF REPORT *",

The residual mucosa is unremarkable\nwith a green velvety appearance .The wall measures up to 0.1 cm in thickness .No cystic\nduct lymph node is identified .Representative sections from the fundus ,mid body, and\ncystic duct resection margin are submitted in one cassette.\nB:The specimen is received fresh and is subsequently placed into formalin and labeled\nright lobe of liver .The specimen consists of a resection specimen of liver tissue\nweighing 1.570 kg. There is a blue suture attached to the inferior edge. The\nanterolateral surface appears dusky and discolored with areas of pallor ,possibly\ncapsular fibrosis, but without any obvious involvement by tumor. The diaphragmatic area\nis unremarkable and the left retrohepatic peritoneal surface is unremarkable. There is a\nresection margin along the medial aspect of the specimen without any obvious tumor at\nthis margin and this is painted blue. The lobe measures 19 cm .from superior to inferior,\n18 cm from medial to lateral, and approximately 10 cm from the anterior surface to the\ndeep bare area .Transverse incisions into the liver lobe shows it to be .expanded and\nmostly replaced by a well circumscribed multinodular tumor that has a seminecrotic and\nhemorrhagic cut surface with viable areas of tumor showing a pale grey to yellow green\ncolor.The tumor itself has dimensions of 14.5 x 8 x 15 cm (photographs has been taken\nof the transverse section showing the mu:;.\u00b1::ilobu'lated tumor) There is no obvious\nextension of the tumor into vascular structures grossly, but at the resection margin,\nthere is large duct or vascular channel that appears to have a granular material balling\nup on its lining.

Representative sectionsincluding the resection are submitted in 10 cassettes.\nMicroscopic Description\nMicroscopy shows a multinodu.lar hepatocellular carcinoma, the tumor growing in confluen\ncompact sheets as well areas of trabeculae. They are Polygonalt\nnuclear pleomorphism and in the more solid areas showprominentsmitoticsactivity. There\nis also a mild inflammatory with neutrophils and focal lymphocytes extending into the\ncarcinoma. There is a central area of degenerat.ior_ but no evidence of direct vascular\ninvasion can be identified. Surrounding hepatic parenchyma shows mild to moderate chronic\ninflammation in portal tracts with focal degeneration of the interface (piecemeal\nnecrosis). There is mild expansion of portal tracts and focal portal portal fibrous septa\nin a pattern consistent with Stage II fibrosis. Focal lobular lymphocytes inflammation isconsistent with Grade II inflammation.\nAccession Number\nEncounter Number\nPatient Location\nrIteria\nb yT5tscrepanry\nHIPAA Discrepancy\nPrior Malignany History\nDual/Synchronous Pi imary Nc\u201e_Page 2 of 2\nYes\nCase is (circle ': UNLI^1^ / Di5 UAL11 TED\nReviewe__rIn;ti{s _. \u2022te Reviewed.\nI 1",

The tumor is morphologically heterogeneous, ranging\nfrom moderately differentiated to poorly differentiated with anaplastic cytology.While\nthe main tumor mass is excised with a 7 mm margin, there is extensive lymphovascular\ninvasion beyond the tumor capsule ,and intralymphatic tumor is present within 2.4 mm of\nthe parenchymal resection margin.Cauterized fragments of tumor are present in blood\nclot adherent to the diaphragm, but these may represent intraoperative artifact, and no\ntrue invasion of the diaphragm is identified. Finally, the specimen designated \"adrenal\"\nshowsadipose tissue with a large intravenous tumor embolus. No adrenal gland is\nidentified. Per discussion with Dr.this tissue was taken from the fat plane\nbetween the liver and the adrenal, and therefore this may represent local extension of\ntumor.\nFinally, the background liver shows cirrhosis (consistent with the known history of\nhepatitis B)as well as a single well-formed non-necrotizing granuloma. Special stains\nfor infectious organisms are pending, and will be reported as an addendum.\nIn case ancillary studies are desired, tumor block information is'listed below:\nBest tumor block: A6\nBestnormal block: A8\nAccession Number\nEncounter Number\nPatient Location\nCrterla P 1 Yes No\nDiagnosis Discrepan cy\nPrimary Tumor Site Discrepancy\nHIPAA Discrepancy\nPrim Malignancy History\nDual/Synchronous Primary ed\nCase is (circle ): QUALIFIED /DISQUA LIFIED\nReviewer Initials Date Reviewed:",

The container\nis designated \"Liver segment 3\". This consists of a segmental resection of liver tissue,\nweighing 201 g and measuring 9.5 cm across the surgical resection margin x 7.5 cm\nperpendicular to the resection margin x 6.0 cm. The shape of the specimen appears to be a\nprotuberant nodule beneath the capsule of the liver. The capsule appears grossly intact.\nThe resection margin is painted blue. Much of the sample is occupied by a well rounded,\nmultinodular tumor that shows areas of hemorrhage and possible necrosis. Some of the\nsmaller lobulated nodules are also discolored green. The tumor measures 8.5 x 7.0 x 6.0\ncm. This massextends close to the capsule with areas of sclerosis on the capsular\nsurface. Between the tumor mass and the resection margin is a zone of parenchyma with a\nnodular, cirrhotic appearance. The tumor lies 0.6 cm from the margin at its nearest\npoint. There is no gross evidence of vascular invasion. Towards one side there appears to\nbe attached adipose tissue on the capsular surface overlying the tumor. Sections are\ntaken as follows:\nAl to 4. tumor with nearest resection margin\nAS to 8. tumor with capsular surface\nA9/10. additional sections of tumor\nA11/12. liver parenchyma away from tumor mass\nMicroscopic Description\nSections show hepatocellular carcinoma with the typical nodular and trabecular growth\npattern with broad trabeculae, mild to moderate nuclear pleomorphism, and scattered\nmitotic activity. The morphology is compatible with grade II hepatocellular carcinoma.\nThere is one focus with venous invasion at the edge of the tumor nodule, but no distant\nvenous invasion can be seen. The resection margins are clear by 6 mm on the histology\nevaluation. The liver capsule shows fibrous thickening overlying the tumor, but there is\nno clear evidence of extracapsular extension and the adherent adipose tissue is not\ninvolved.\nThe adjacent liver shows well developed cirrhosis. There are well preserved portal\ntracts, but architecture between portal tracts and central venules is disturbed with\nmultiple small nodules. There is a chronic inflammatory infiltrate in the portal tracts\nand fibrous septae focally aggregating into nodules, but also focally showing spill over\nand obscuring of the liver cell plates, consistent with mild and focal interface\nhepatitis. This is mostly made up of small lymphocytes, but plasma cells can be easily\nfound. There is minimal fatty change in the parenchyma and minimal hemosiderin\naccumulation. No other abnormal inclusions can be seen. Immunostains for hepatitis B\nsurface and core antigen are negative. The etiology of the underlying cirrhosis is\ndifficult to ascertain, but the areas with lymphoid aggregates and the past history of\ndocumented Rep C would be compatible with this being the main etiology. The presence of\nplasma cells always the consideration of autoimmune hepatitis, but the morphology is not\nspecific. An additional finding that might correlate with the imageing are areas with\nbile duct dilation and aggregation in the fibrous septa recapitulating the pattern of Von\nMeyenbergs complexes, but more comptible with secondary change due to the cirrhosis.\nAccession Number\nEncounter Number\nPatient Location\n1/7/1 ,11Yes do\nGheris\nosis Discrepancy -14---- --T '^ Diagn\nPrimary Tumor Site Discrepancy\nHIPAA Discrepancy\nPrior Malignancy History\nDual/Synchronous Primary Noted",

Specimen A is designated \"gallbladder.\" The specimen\nconsists of a blue-green gallbladder measuring 7.3 x 3.0 x 3.0 cm. The\nspecimen is opened revealing approximately 20 mL of light green viscous\nbile intermixed with a single brown-black gallstone measuring 0.5 cm.\nThe mucosal surface has a granular green appearance and a uniform wall\nthickness of 0.1 cm. The bile duct is opened and is unremarkable. No\nadditional stones are identified. The specimen is sampled in cassette\nA.\nB. Specimen B is designated \"liver, right lobe.\" The specimen\nconsists of a 1160 gm right hemihepatectomy measuring 20.0 x 14.0 x 5.0\ncm. The surgical cauterized margin is inked black. The specimen is\nsectioned perpendicular to the margin revealing a 6.5 x 6.0 x 4.6 cm tan-red lobulated and essentially solid appearing lesion located 0.2 cm\nfrom the closest surgical. The surgeon is notified. The specimen is\nphotographed. The surrounding parenchyma has a tan-red, yellow soft\ncoloration and consistency. No additional lesions are grossly\nidentified. Representative tissue is secured for potential future\nstudies.\nMICROSCOPIC:\nMicroscopic examination is performed.\nThe sections show a well differentiated hepatocellular neoplasm that is\npartially encapsulated and partially blending with the normal liver.\nThere are pseudo-portal tracts within the mass, with vessels but no bile\nducts. There is minimal nuclear atypia but no glandular or\npseudoglandular formation. The tumor also shows areas of steatosis,\npeliosis and extramedullary hematopoiesis. We do not see vascular\ninvasion. There is some hemorrhage and an infarct-like area ,which we\nsuspect may represent the prior biopsy area.\nBased on these H\\T\\E features, we favored a hepatocellular adenoma.\nThere was an outside biopsy called hepatocellular carcinoma, which we\nhave not reviewed, case was reviewed at the\ncalled hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), in part based on\nfocal loss of reticulin meshwork and focal glypican staining. Given our\nquestions about the diagnosis of HCC, we elected to perform some additional studies on this case.\nImmunostains show that the tumor has only membranous staining for\nbeta-catenin, without nuclear staining. This is a pattern that is\ntypical for adenoma, although it is reported that some\nwell-differentiated HCCs also lack nuclear beta-catenin. A CD34 stain\nshows that most of the has a well-formed sinusoidal vascular pattern but\nin scattered areas, this becomes difficult to define. I also performed\nreticulin stains on all 6 blocks of the tumor, and again, in\nmuch of the tumor, there is good plate formations which are one or two\ncells thick; there are areas where the reticulin meshwork is poorly\ndefined, and some ball-like collections are present. A glypican\nimmunostain is still pending.\nOverall, the histologic and special stain features are equivocal for the\ndifferential of adenoma versus well-differentiated HCC. What pushes me\nover the line for a diagnosis of HCC is the age and sex of the patient\nyear old man), which is quite atypical for adenoma. Studies have\nshown that even tumors with classic features of adenoma present in\npatients 9particulalry men) older than have sometimes behaved like\nwell-differentiated HCC. Taking that information with the histology, I\nthink it is best to classify this as a very well-differentiated\nadenoma-like HCC.\nThe native liver shows moderate macrovesicular steatosis (25 percent), and some modest chronic inflammation, without the hepatocellular\nballooning of a true steatohepatitis .There is no evidence of\nsignificant fibrosis or cirrhosis in the non-tumor liver.\nLiver tumor checklist:\nProcedure :partial hepatectomy (right lobe)\nHistologic type :hepatocellular carcinoma ,adenoma -like (see above)\nHistologic grade :Well-differentiated\nTumor size: 6.5 cm\nNumber of tumor nodules and location :One nodule; right lobe\nAngiolymphatic invasion :Absent\nInvasion of major branch of portal or hepatic vein: Absent\nInvolvement of adjacent organ or perforation of visceral peritoneum:\nAbsent\nResection margins: Negative; distance from nearest margin: 0.2 cm Lymph nodes :None sampled\nTumor stage :pT1/NX (pT1: solitary tumor without vascular invasion)\nUninvolved liver: Steatosis with inflammation",

Dr. agrees.\nClinical History\nThe patient is a -year-old woman with a left-sided liver mass.\nAccording to she presented with left upper quadrant in\nand a CT at that time revealed a left-sided liver mass and no risk\nfactors for hepatocellular carcinoma. A core biopsy revealed\nhepatocellular carcinoma with focal glandular differentiation\nCK19-positive, AFP-negative, arginase-positive). She is additionally\nnoted to have a history of splenectomy for hereditary spherocytosis and\nis status post cholecystectomy in for cholecystitis, which work-up\nrevealed papillary stenosis with a narrowing of the common bile duct.\nGross Description\nThe case is received in five parts, labeled with the patient's name and\nmedical record number.\nPart A is received fresh and additionally labeled \"2 bile duct left ink\nmarks distal margin frozen,\" and consists of a single fragment of\nred-tan soft tissue (0.7 x 0.3 x 0.1 cm) marked by a circle of black ink\non the one end.

The specimen\nis previously disrupted at the capsule with a section taken by the\nsurgeon for banking prior to receipt in Pathology.\nGROSS ABNORMALITIES: There is a white-tan, firm, multinodular\nwell-circumscribed mass (12.1 cm from right to left x 8 cm from superior\nto inferior x 14 cm from anterior to posterior) that extends to the\ncapsule, which is distorted and contracted by the mass. The mass is\nnoted 0.5 cm from the resection margin (slice 6). There is no grossly\nevident necrosis within the mass. Additionally, scattered smaller\nwhite-tan nodules are seen adjacent to, but apparently distinct from the\nmass. The liver parenchyma is otherwise red-brown, firm, and\"\nunremarkable.

No tumor identified at surgical resection margins.\n3. Non-neoplastic hepatic parenchyma showing minimal\nmacrovesicular steatosis.\nCOMMENT:\nThe three hepatic tumors generally resemble hepatocellular carcinoma,\nbut because of focal poorly differentiated areas(most notable in block\nB5 of the 0.8 cm nodule), immunoperoxidase stains for Arqinase-1 and\nCK19 were performed on block B5 in order to exclude the possibility of a\ncombined hepatocellular and cholangiolar carcinoma. These stains show\nthe tumor cells to be diffusely positive for Arginase-l and entirely\nnegative for CK19. A mucicarmine stain performed on block B5 is\nnegative in the tumor cells. A reticulin stain performed on block B5\nconfirms lack of normal hepatocellular architecture among the tumor cells. Together, these findings support the diagnosis of hepatocellular\ncarcinoma. Dr. has reviewed selected slides from this case,\nincluding the immunoperoxidase stains, and agrees with the diagnosis of\nmoderately to poorly differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma.\nLiver Tumor Synoptic Comment:\n- Tumor type: Hepatocellular carcinoma (see above discussion).\n-Histologic grade: Moderate to poorly differentiated (grade\n2-3/3; see above discussion).\n- Tumor size (maximum diameter of largest lesion): 4.9 cm.\n- Tumor necrosis: None identified.\n-Multifocality (more than one tumor separated by nontumorous liver\nparenchyma): Present.\n--Estimated total tumor diameter of all HCC foci: 8.7 cm.\n- Vascular invasion: Focal lymphatic invasion present (slide B1);\nno blood vessel invasion identified.\n- Hepatic capsule: Tumor focally abuts but does not penetrate through\noverlying liver capsule.\n- Local extension of tumor: Confined to liver.\n- Hepatic surgical margins: Negative for tumor; tumor is 0.7 cm from\nnearest margin.\n- Non-neoplastic liver: Minimal steatosis, no significant fibrosis\n(confirmed by trichrome stain performed on block B7.\n- Hepatocellular nodules (in cirrhotic liver): Not applicable (no\ncirrhosis present).\n- Lymph node status: Not applicable (no lymph nodes sample by surgical\nprocedure).\n- AJCC Stage: pT2bNX.\nSpecimen (s) Received\nA:Gallbladder\nB:Left hepatic lobe\n.Clinical History\nThe patient is a -year-old man.

There is mass effect nn the\nIVC and on the right hepatic vein.\nGross Description\nThe case is received in five parts, labeled with the patient's name and\nmedical record number.\nPart A is received fresh and additionally labeled \"left hepatic artery\nLN,\" and consists of a single intact, ovoid lymph node (1.1 x 0.6 x 0.5\ncm).The node is bisected to reveal a grossly unremarkable, solid,\ntan-pink cut surface. The nodes is submitted in its entirety in\ncassette Al.\nPart B is received fresh and additionally labeled \"cystic artery LN,\"\nand consists of a single tan-brown, ovoid, intact lymph node (1.1 x 0.6\nx 0.3 cm) with scant attached soft, yellow fibroadipose tissue. The\nnode is bivalved to reveal a grossly unremarkable, solid, tan-pink cut\nsurface. The node is submitted in its entirety in cassette Bl.\nPart C is received fresh and additionally labeled \"gallbladder,\"\nand consists of an intact gallbladder (5.5 cm in length, 2.1 cm in\ndiameter at fundus, 1.1 cm diameter a neck). The gallbladder is\nbright-green and has a smooth and glistening serosal surface. The\nadventitial surface is dull and ragged but intact. The cystic duct\nmargin measures 0.5 cm in outside diameter and is free of impacting\ncalculi. The gallbladder contains thin, green bile and is devoid of\nstones. The gallbladder wall is-thin and pliable, of even thickness\n(0.2 cm) and free of any areas of induration. The gallbladder mucosa is\ngreen and velvety, free of any areas of ulceration or polyps. No cystic\nduct lymph node is identified. Representative sections, including the\ninked cystic duct margin, are submitted in cassette Cl.\nPart D 'is received fresh and additionally labeled \"portal caval LN,\" and\nconsists of a single intact, ovoid lymph node (1.6 x 0 .8x 0.7 cm) with\na scant amount of attached yellow, lobulated adipose tissue. The node\nis sectioned to reveal a congested but otherwise grossly unremarkable,\ntan-pink cut surface .The node is submitted in its entirety in cassette\nDI.\nPart E is received fresh and additionally labeled \"right hepatectomy\nwith partial diaphragm,\" and consists of a portion of liver (885 gm;\n13.5 cm from right to left x 11 cm from anterior to posterior x 18 cm\nfrom superior to inferior). There is an exophytic masson the superior\nsurface, which has been cut in to prior to recept by Pathology, and\nharvested for banking by The mass is soft, yellow-gold and\nhomogenous (7 x 6 x 6 cm), and is within 0.1 cm of the capsule and 0.7\ncm. from the surgical resection margin. There is a second lesion\nadjacent to the first lesion, which is larger and appears to be a\ndistinct lesion, and is soft, yellow-gold and focally hemorrhagic (9 x 6 x 6 cm) and is 1.4 cm from the surgical resection margin. There is a\nvessel running between the two lesions, which does not appear to be\ninvolved. There is an oval white-tan fragment of diaphragm on the\nsuperior surface of the specimen. The tumor appears to be abutting, but\ndoes not invade the diaphragm. The remainder of the hepatic parenchyma\nis firm, red-brown and without nodules.\nORIENTED BY Surgeon's sutures (black short stitch\nvena cava, black long stitch = right hepatic vein).\nINKING:\n- Surgical margin: Black.\n- Right hepatic vein: Yellow.\n- Sidewall vena cava: Green.\n- Diaphragm: Green.\nCASSETTES:\nEl:\nE2:\nE3:\nE4:\nE5:\nE6:\nE7:\nE8:\nE9:\nE10:\nEll:Representative sections are submitted\nRight hepatic vein margin.\nVessel between lesions.\nLesion\nLesion\nLesion\nLesion\nLesionclosest approach\nclosest approach\nwith adjacentsidewall of\nas follows:\nto capsule.\nto diaphragm.\nnormal parenchyma.\nwith adjacent normal.\nclosest approach to capsule.\nLesion #1.\nUninvolved hepatic\nLesion #1 with IVCparenchyma.\nsidewall.\nDiagnosis based on gross and microscopic examinations.

This result should be correlated with\nthe patient's clinical presentation, family history, and findings from\nthe microsatellite instability (MSI) test.Referral for clinical\ngenetics evaluation and counseling should be considered to help\ndistinguish between these possibilities for the patients and their\nfamily members.\n- Macroscopic tumor perforation:Not identified.\n-Grade of tumor: Low grade.\n- Treatment effect: Not applicable.\n-Microscopic depth of invasion: Tumor invades submucosa (pTl).\n-Blood/lymphatic vessel invasion:None.\n-Perineural invasion: None.\n- Margins: Negative.\nProximal margin: Negative; tumor is 17 cm from margin.\n- Distal margin: Negative; tumor is 14.3 cm from margin.\nSerosa:Negative; tumor is 0.4 cm from serosa (slide B7).\n- Lymph node-status:\n- Negative; total number of nodes examined: 14.\n- Satellite tumor deposits (TD): None present.\n-Other pathologic findings in bowel: None. - Polyps with invasive carcinoma: Tubular adenoma.\n- AJCC/UICC stage: pT1NO.\nDr. I has reviewed slide A2 (including CD34 immunostain) and\nconcurs with the interpretation of tumor invasion through capsule into\nfat, but not through the visceral peritoneum, and with focal vascular\ninvasion.\nSpecimen(s) Received\nA:Left lateral segment - for gross, then perm\nB:Right colon and colon anastomosis\nClinical History\nPer review of ,the patient is a year-old male with a reported\nhistory of colon cancer in and cirrhosis with multifocal\nhepatocellular carcinoma'(prior pathology not reviewed atThe\npatient now has an endoscopically unresectable sessile polyp in the\nascending colon as well as hepatic left lobe multifocal hepatocellular\ncarcinoma and undergoes left lobe partial hepatectomy and right\nhemicolectomy.\nGross Description\nThe case is received in two parts, each labeled with the patient's name\nand medical record number.\nPart A is received fresh, labeled \"left lateral segment for gross, then\npermanent,\" and consists of a partial hepatectomy (487.5 gm; 10.5 cm\nright to left x 16.5 cm anterior to posterior x 5.1 cm superior to\ninferior).\nGROSS ABNORMALITIES: There is a yellow-red, well-circumscribed, solid\ndominant mass(7x 4.5 x 4 cm), 0.1 cm from the surgical resection\nmargin.

See\nadditional comments below.\n- Non-neoplastic liver: Mass effect (portal-based inflammation, scant\nlobular hepatocyte necrosis, enlargement of some intrahepatic bile\nducts, and periductal fibrosis; small portal tracts show mild ductular\nproliferation).\n- Lymph node status:\nNegative for tumor; total number of nodes examined: 3.\nAJCC Stager pT1NO.\nIn part .AA. (left main bile duct) atypical glands are seen invading\nperiductal nerve tissue. Level sections and immunohistochemistry for\nkeratin cocktail and 5100 were performed and evaluated on block Al to\nfurther assess.the atypical glands. The keratin cocktail shows diffuse\nstrong nuclear staining in the atypical glands. The S100 highlights the\nnerves but does not stain the atypical cells involving the nerve tissue.\nThis supports a diagnosis of invasive adenocarcinoma.\nIn Part C (left hepatic resection) the hepatic parenchymal resection\nmargin is negative. Tumor is present in the left main bile duct margin.\nHowever, surgical correlation is required for final margin status as\nadditional tissue is submitted in Part D and the new common bile duct\nmargin in the additional tissue is negative.\nIn Part C, sections of the hepatic mass show moderately differentiated\ncholangiocarcinoma invading hepatic parenchyma and nerve tissue. One\narea of the adenocarcinoma is better differentiated and has dilated,\nangulated ducts closely resembling a large von Meyenburg complex.\nImmunohistochemical stains for p53, MIB-1, DPC-4, and glypican-3. were\nperformed on block C3 and compared in both areas. Both areas show weak\nscattered nuclear p53 staining, no loss of DPC-4, and negative\nGlypican-3. The moderately-differentiated area shows MIB-i staining in\n30% of tumor nuclei and focally up to 50%, while the lower grade area\nshows less than 5% MIB-1 nuclear staining. The morphologic appearance\nand immunoprofile are most consistent with both areas being part of the\nsame lesion. It is possible that -the higher-grade area of the tumor\narose from this more well-differentiated component at some point in\ntime.\nFor part D, level sections were performed and evaluated on blocks D2 and\nD5 (the extrahepatic bile duct). The levels do not show any high-grade\ndysplasia or carcinoma.\nDr. has reviewed parts A and D including additional\nimmunostains and levels and agrees with the above diagnosis for these\nparts.

She undergoes a left hepatic\nresection.\nGross Description\nThe case is received in six parts, labeled with the patient's name and\nmedical record number.\nPart A is received fresh and additionally labeled \"left main bile duct,\"\nand consists of a single, donut-shaped fragment of white-tan soft tissue\n(0.8 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm) with a 0.3 cm lumen and one inked surface. Per\ndiscussion with the surgeon, the inked surface is the most\nproximal aspect, and the non-inked surface is the true margin and most\ndistal surface. The entire specimen is frozen for frozen section\ndiagnosis 1 (inked surface side up), and subsequently submitted in\ncassette Al. f\nPart B is received fresh and additionally labeled \"right bile duct, up\nis distal,\" and consists of an oriented, tubular segment of red-pink\nsoft tissue (0.5 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm in length). The specimen is submitted\nfor frozen section evaluation FS2 (cutting toward true margin), with the\nfrozen section remnant submitted in full in cassette Bl.\nPart C is received fresh and additionally labeled \"extended left\nhepatic resection, caudate plus tumor, blue = bile duct, black = portal\nvein,\" and consists of a partial hepatectomy (434 gm; 18.5 cm from right\nto left x 5.3.cm from anterior to posterior x 12.8 cm from superior to\ninferior; caudate lobe 6.2 x 3.7 x 3.1 cm).\nGROSS ABNORMALITIES: A white, circumscribed ,firm mass with pushing\nborders (3.3 x 3.1 x 4.5 cm) is present in the central portion of the\nAk specimen and abuts the capsule on the visceral/posterior side. The mass\ninvades into the left main bile duct, extends to the bile duct margin\ngrossly, and is located 1.5 cm from the inked hepatic resection margin.\nThe mass also surrounds intraparenchymal blood vessels but does not\ngrossly invade into them. The intimal surfaces of these vessels'and of\nthe portal vein are smooth and white. The uninvolved right liver lobe\nis homogeneously red-brown and spongy-firm. The left lobe is attenuated\nwith dilated vessels. No gallbladder is present and no lymph nodes are\nidentified.\nORIENTED BY: Surgeon's suture: Blue suture = left main bile duct,\nblack suture = portal vein.\nAlso, per discussion with Dr. :The specimen contains caudate\nlobe and segment 8.\nINKING:\n- Liver capsule overlying mass: Blue.\n- Hepatic resection margin: Black.\nPOTENTIAL STUDIES: Fresh tumor and uninvolved hepatic parenchyma are\nsubmitted to the tissue bank.\nCASSETTES: Representative sections are submitted as follows:\nCl: Left main bile duct-margin and neighboring portal\nvein, en face.\nC2: Mass and left main bile duct.\nC3: Mass, portal vein and resection margin.\nC4-C5: Mass and overlying capsule.\nC6: Mass and large intraparenchymal vessels.\nC7: Uninvolved hepatic left lobe.\nC8-C9: Uninvolved hepatic right lobe.\nC10: Soft tissue near bile duct margin.\nPart D is received fresh and additionally labeled \"extrahepatic bile\nduct,\" and consists of an oriented, branching, tubular structure (4 cm\nin length x 1 cm in maximum diameter). The specimen is oriented by the\nsurgeon with multiple stitches as follows: The cystic duct is tagged\nwith a double stitch, the right bile duct is tagged with a single black\nstitch, and the left bile duct is tagged with a blue stitch. The common\nbile duct is inked by the surgeon. Frozen section evaluation is\nrequested for the common bile duct margin. The common bile duct\ncontains a double-lumen structure (0.3 cm and 0.5 cm in diameter).,. The\ncystic duct is 0.4 cm in length x 0.4 cm in diameter, the left bile duct\nis 0,3 cm in length x 0.2 cm in diameter ,and the right bile duct is 0.5\ncm in length x 0.4 cm in diameter. Extending from the hepatic duct,\nadjacent to the right bile duct, i s a fragment of soft tissue measuring\n0.7 x 0.5 x 0. 4cm.. No masses or lesions are noted.\nINKING:\n- Area adjacent to common bile duct surgical margin: Yellow, after the\nfrozen section has been removed.\n- Cystic duct resection margin: Blue.\n- Left bile duct resection margin: Black.\n-Right bile duct resection margin: Green.\nThe surgeon designated common bile duct margin is submitted for frozen\nsection evaluation FS3 (designated extrahepatic bile duct biopsy).J\nCASSETTES :The specimen is entirely submitted as follows:\nDl: Frozen section remnant (FS3).\nD2: Right bile duct margin (inked )and adjacent slice.\nD3: Commonbile duct adjacent to FS3 and remaining common bile duct.\nD4: Cystic duct (inked) and adjacent cystic duct.\nD5: Left bile duct (inked).\nD6: Hepatic duct at level of cystic duct.\nD7: Remainder of hepatic duct.\nD8: Attached soft tissue.\nPart E is received fresh and additionally labeled \"gallbladder,,\" and\nconsists of a gallbladder (6.2 x 3 x 2.6 cm). The serosal surface is\ntan-green, smooth and glistening. The surface opposed to the liver is\nragged and green-brown. The cystic duct is patent to the probe with a\ndiameter of 0.3 cm. Two firm, ovoid, red lymph node candidates (0.8 x\n0.5 x 0.4 cm and 0.5 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm) are identified near the cystic\nduct.The gallbladder contains viscous green bile and its mucosa is\ngreen and reticulated with numerous scattered punctate yellow spots (up\nto 0.1 cm). No stones are identified. The gallbladder wall thickness\naverages 0.1-0.2 cm. The. cystic duct and surface opposed to the liver\nare inked blue. Representative cassettes are submitted as follows:\nEl: Cystic duct margin and two intact lymph nodes.\nE2: -Sections of body and fundus.\nPart F is received fresh and additionally labeled \"RT hepatic artery\nlymph node,\" and consists of two unoriented, irregular, tan-white tissue\nfragments. with metal clips (1.9 x 1.3 x 0.5 cm and 0.7 x 0..6 x 0.2 cm}.\nThe specimen is submitted intact in cassette Fl.\nThe immunoperoxidase stain(s) reported above were developed and their\nperformance characteristics determined by the\nDepartment of Pathology.

The\nliver tumor is multinodular with areas of extensive hemorrhage and necrosis.\nThe malignant hepatocytes are arranged in thickened cords with nuclear\natypia and mitosis with some areas of classical trabecular HCC. Areas of\nextensive pseudoglandular architecture are also present as are areas of\ndiffuse intracytoplasmic vacuolar inclusions, resulting in a signet ring cell like\nmorphology. There are also extensive steatotic neoplastic hepatocytes with\ncytoplasmic bile inclusions as well as some malignant cells with Mallory (hyaline .In some of the slightly more peripheral nodules, benign hepatocytes\nhave areas of FNH like architecture with proliferating ductules along fibrous\nsepta .In one of these foci, a nodule of definite HCC is present. Multifocal\nvenous invasion is seen (large and small) with at least one nodule of HCC\nadhering to the endothelium .Areas of the nodules lack the cytologic and\narchitectural atypia to be considered HCC and appear to represent the\nbackground adenoma.\nImmunohistochemical characterization is similarly heterogenous with areas of\nsteatotic hepatocytes within the nodule expressing amyloid A stain while other\nareas with the FNH like architecture are negative for amyloid A. Glutamine\nsynthetase has a geographic staining pattern in apparently hepatocellular\nadenoma like areas ,with strong diffuse staining in steatotic and trabecular\nHCC. Glypican 3 is negative throughout, while HSP 70 is positive in trabecular\nHCC (focally in the same area as the glutamine synthetase).\nThe non-neoplastic liver has intact architecture (supported by trichrome and\nreticulin stains )with mild portal inflammation and patchy portal fibrosis.

In other bile duct profiles,\nintraductal biliary papillomatosis is present as multifocal papillary lesions. Intraductal papillary carcinoma is\nconsidered to be to be the in situ lesion for the invasive\ncholangiocarcinoma, and is related to the pancreatic intraductal\nmucinous neoplasm. Dysplasia of the bile duct epithelium without\npapillomatosis most likely is part of the same neoplastic\nprocess in this case. The invasive tumor does not have papillary\narchitecture, and is a conventional gland-forming\nadenocarcinoma. Invasive carcinoma is present as large mass\nlesions/nodules (mass forming subtype).\nExtensive peri-ductal invasion (carcinoma spread along intact\nbiliary tree) is not identified. The tumor is staged as a\npathologic T3 because of invasion into perihepatic fibroadipose\ntissue at the round ligament.\nClinical History:\n-year-old female with intrahepatic malignant neoplasm\nconsistent with cholangiocarcinoma.\nGross Description:\nReceived are four formalin-filled containers.\nContainer A is additionally labeled \"Level 5 liver lesion.\" It\nholds a 0.8 x 0.7 x 0.4 cm wedge-shaped fragment of gray/tan\nliver which is partially covered with a smooth capsule. The\nparenchymal surface is inked black and the specimen is\nsectioned to reveal a 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm circumscribed white\nsubcapsular nodule abutting the black inked parenchymal margin.\nThe specimen is serially sectioned and entirely submitted in\nblock Al,\nContainer B is additionally labeled \"Segment 8 liver.\" The\nrequisition states: stitch marks definitive segment 8 margin.\nIt holds a 3.1 gram, 2.4 x 2.2 x 1.7 cm friable fragment of\nliver tissue with two sutures present on one surface\ndesignating definitive margin. This surface is inked black, and\nthe opposite surface is inked red for identification purposes.\nThe specimen is sectioned perpendicular to the black inked\nmargin and entirely submitted in blocks Bl-B5.\nSectioning reveals two white circumscribed nodules which are 0.4\nand 0.8 cm in greatest dimension. Each nodule abuts the red\ninked margin opposite the sutured margin. The smaller nodule\ncomes within 0.2 cm of the black inked sutured margin\n(B3), and the larger nodule comes within 0.3 cm of the black\ninked sutured margin (B1). Block Summary:\nBl-B5,\nContainer C is additionally labeled \"Liver, Segments 2-5.\" It\nconsists of a 545 gram, 18 x 13 x 5 cm partial hepatectomy\nspecimen composed of Segments 2-5. The capsule is brown/gray,\nfocally plaque-like. The parenchymal margin is inked blue. There\nis a small amount of attached fat along the inferior edge of\nSegment 5. Along the medial edge of the parenchymal margin there\nis a 3.4 x 2.9 cm fragment of fibromembranous tissue and\ncauterized fat. This area is adherent upon the capsule.\nSectioning demonstrates a dominate nodule surrounded by\nmultiple butting nodules off its edge and within the remainder\nof the parenchyma. The dominate nodule is 11.2 x 9.8 x 4.4 cm.\nThe smaller nodule within the parenchyma and subcapsular range\nfrom 0.1 to 4 cm in greatest dimension. The closest approach to\nthe parenchymal margin (inked black) is 0.2 cm. The tumor has a\nsolid gritty yellow/tan cut surface with areas of firm,\nwhite tissue at the periphery.

A mucicarmine stain and immunostains are\nperformed on block B5. The mucicarmine stain is negative. The\nmalignant cells are positive for Cam 5.2, CK7 (focal),\nCD5, CEA (focal, cytoplasmic), and CD56 (focal), and negative\nfor CK20, HepParl, chromogranin, and synaptophysin. In the\nappropriate clinical setting, these findings are consistent with\nintrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. The preliminary results were\nreported to Dr. by text message on\nRepresentative H & E stained sections, the mucin stain, and the\nimmunostains were also reviewed by Dr. , who agrees with the\ninterpretation.\nIntraoperative Consult Diagnosis:\nA frozen section was requested by Dr. in OR\nFSA1: Liver, segment 8, final margin\n- Benign liver with mild inflammation of portal tracts and\nsteatosis, no tumor seen\nDrs. at on\nClinical History:\n-year-old female with a liver mass.\nGross Description:\nSpecimen A was received fresh for frozen section labeled\n\"segment 8 final margin\" and consists of a 3.8 x 2.5 x 0.4 cm\nfragment of red/brown tissue. A stitch marks the final margin.\nThe final margin is inked blue and the remainder is inked black.\nThe cut surface is smooth, tan/brown, and unremarkable. A full\nthickness section was frozen as FSA1 and the remainder is\nsubmitted in Al-A4,\nSpecimen B is labeled \"liver segment 2, 3, 4, and part of 8\" and\nconsists of a 650 gram, 16.5 x 15.5 x7.4 cm partial hepatectomy\nspecimen that has a short suture indicated as segment 8 (per\nrequisition). The parenchymal margin is inked black and the caval margin is inked red. There is an 11.9 x 9.3 x 5.8 cm\nlobulated firm smooth pink/tan mass with patchy areas of soft\nyellow discoloration occupying approximately 15% of the mass.\nThis mass is 0.1 cm from the caval margin, grossly abuts the\nvessels at the vascular margin, is 0.5 cm from the parenchymal\nmargin, and focally retracts the capsule but does not extend\nthrough it. The mass occupies approximately 75% of the\nparenchyma with the regional vasculature uninvolved by mass. The\nvasculature has a smooth and glistening gray/white inner lining.\nThe remainder of the parenchyma is tan/brown and unremarkable.\nThe capsule is intact, purple/gray and smooth with a 6.3 x 5.7\nx 0.2 cm piece of adherent fibrofatty tissue (inked blue). The\nmass is 0.1 cm from the fibrofatty tissue. A portion of tumor\nwas given to tissue procurement.\nBlock Summary:\nB1 - Perpendicular of mass with vascular margin\nB2 - Perpendicular mass with caval margin\nB3 - Perpendicular of mass closest to the parenchymal margin\n(segment 8 margin)\nB4 - Mass with overlying adherent fibrofatty tissue\nB5 - Mass with capsule\nB6 - Mass with regional vasculature\nB7 - Yellow discoloration of mass\nB8 - Uninvolved parenchyma away from mass\nAdditional sections following initial microscopic examination:\nB9 - Perpendicular of mass closest to caval margin\nB10-B12 - Perpendicular of mass closest to parenchymal margin\nB13 - Bile duct margin, en face\nB14-B15 - Additional duct/vascular margin, en face (along the\nparenchymal margin)\nSpecimen C is labeled \"gallbladder\" and consists of a 9.6 cm\nlong x 2.8 cm in diameter intact gallbladder.

The tubular fragment is\nserially sectioned to reveal a lymph node which is submitted in A3,\nSpecimen B is labeled \"gallbladder\" and holds a 9.5 x 4.0 x 2.5 cm\nintact gallbladder. The serosa is dark red and glistening. The lumen\nis filled with dark red liquid. There are multiple tan granular\ntissue fragments, loosely adherent to the mucosa which is tan red\nand velvety. The wall is 0.2 cm thick.\nBlock Summary:\nBl - Cystic duct margin and representative sections of gallbladder\nwall to include loosely adherent yellow granules\nTissue remains in formalin.\nSpecimen C is labeled \"segments 6, 7 and 8, cava, left adrenal\ngland\" and holds an en bloc resection weight 255 grams with an\noverall measurement of 15.4 x 8.4 x 5.6 cm. Attached to the deep\nedge of the resection is a 4 cm in length x 1.1 cm in diameter large\ncaliber vessel which has a pink, smooth, luminal surface.\nOn one side of the vessel, there is a large segment of liver,\nroughly 13 x 8.4 x 3.5 cm. The surgical margin of this segment is\ninked black. On the opposite side of the large caliber vessel there\nis a 4.5 x 2.9 x 2.8 cm segment of liver. The surgical margin of\nthis segment is inked blue. Adherent to the distal aspect of the\nlarge caliber vessel is a 6.5 x 3.1 x 0.6 cm fragment of yellow\nfibrofatty tissue. Within the tissue, there is a portion of adrenal\ngland, 2.5 x 2.5 x 1.0 cm. The presumed adrenal gland surgical\nmargin is inked red. The capsule is dark maroon and intact.\nSectioning reveals an approximately 5.8 x 4.0 x 3.8 cm tan firm mass\nwith ill-defined edges. The mass grossly appears to invade into the\nattached adrenal tissue, and abuts but does not grossly appear to\ninvade into the large caliber vessel. Within the smaller segment of\nliver there are two satellite similar appearing lesions, roughly 1\ncm from the main mass. The mass comes to within 1.0 cm of the black\ninked surgical margin, is 0.6 cm from the blue inked surgical margin\n(satellite nodule) and is greater than 1 cm from the proximal and\ndistal large caliber vessel surgical margin.

The resection margin measured 179 x 101mm.\nBeneath the diaphragmatic surface there was evidence of pale\ntumour in the subcapsular area which on sectioning showed a pale\nlobulated tumour mass measuring 43mm in maximum. Further\nsectioning revealed further smaller areas of tumour ranging in\nsize from 4mm up to 17mm. These all appear to be within the\ngeneral area of the main tumour mass. The background liver\nparenchyma appeared rather fatty. Towards the inferior portion of\nthe liver a further solitary tumour mass 15mm in maximum was\npresent, this being some 17mm from the resection margin.\nBlocks: A - smaller inferior lesion to closest margin, B - whole\nsection of small lesion, C&D - whole section from larger tumour\nmass to closest resection margin, E-K - sections from tumour mass,\nL-N - background liver.\nMicro Report\nHistology shows multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma with a variety\nof architectural patterns including nodules with marked steatosis\nand Mallory's hyaline and other areas in which there is a rather\nmore nested and trabecular pattern of growth. The tumour is\ncompletely excised by a margin of at least 14mm from the surgical\nmargin. There is no evidence of capsular breach or peritoneal\nsurface involvement.\nPage 1 of 2 The background liver shows established bridging fibrosis, focally\namounting to early cirrhosis (confirmed on Van Gieson and\nreticulin stains). There is moderate, predominantly\nmacrovesicular, steatosis. Areas of periportal, interface and\nfocal lobular inflammation are noted, however, these may be\nrelated to the presence of tumour. The inflammatory infiltrate is\ncomposed predominantly of small lymphocytes. Occasional plasma\ncells and eosinophils are also noted.\nAn orcein stain for copper associated protein is negative.\nA Perls' stain for iron is'negative.\nNo PAS positive diastase resistant globules are identified.\nSummary\nOverall the features are those of multifocal hepatocellular\ncarcinoma arising in a background of cirrhotic liver.

The serosal surface is puckered\nbut there is no evidence of macroscpic invasion through the liver\ncapsule. The cut surface of the tumour is cream with a green tinge\nand appears to have a fibrous capsule. The capsule is puckered but\nthere is no evidence of macroscopic invasion through the liver\ncapsule. Throughout the rest of the liver there are multiple\ndistended vessels within portal tracts that appear to be filled\nwith cream-coloured tissue similar to that of the tumour. The\ntumour lies 12mm away from the resection margin which is inked\nblue. The background liver does not appear obviously cirrhotic.\nWithin the background liver a single other cream coloured nodule\nis noted that does not seem to be associated with a portal area\nthat measures 4mm in maximum dimension.\nBlocks taken: 1A-1H representative sections through the tumour;\n11 section of other nodule noted; 1J-1L representative sections\nthrough the dilated vessels in the background liver; 1M normal\nbackground liver.\n2.A gallbladder containing bile with no obvious focal lesions\nidentified.\nHistology\nTumour type : Hepatocellular carcinoma NOS\nTumour grade /differentiation\nby worse area : Moderate\nTumour cells present at margin: No\nif margin is clear: is clearance >10mm: Yes\nMacroscopic vascular invasion\nconfirmed: No\nPage 2 of 4 Microscopic vascular invasion\nidentified: Yes\nEvidence of response to\npreoperative treatment: N/A\nBackground liver\nFibrosis : None present\nAetiology : Not known, see comment\nComments\nA single tumour is surrounded by a fibrous capsule and consists of\nsheets of hepatocytes with loss of the normal liver architecture.\nThere is evidence of cytological atypia and nuclear pleomorphism.\nIn some areas of the tumour there is formation of variably sized\ngland like structures. Outwith the tumour multiple foci of\nlymphovascular invasion are identified. There is no significant\nbile production by the tumour. The features are those of a\nhepatocellular carcinoma.\nWithin the surrounding normal liver there is evidence of chronic\ninflammation and regenerative liver nodules. Within the portal\nareas through the rest of the liver there is evidence of portal\nvein distention. The portal vein branches are completely full of a\nforeign body giant cell reaction to embolic material.\nThere is no evidence of fibrosis within the background liver.\nThere is some mild steatosis and mild chronic inflammation within\nthe portal areas. A Perl's stain for iron does reveal scattered\niron deposition within hepatocytes. There is no evidence of any\nobvious underlying pathology to suggest the aetiology of this\nhepatocellular carcinoma. However, the presence of iron within\nhepatocytes does raise the possibility of a iron storage disorder\nand clinical correlation is advised.\nPathological staging : pT2, pNx, pMx\n2.
