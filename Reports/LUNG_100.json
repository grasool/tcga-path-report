Focally, in one residual bronchus , an area of in \nsitu adenocarcinoma is identified. In addition , some subpleural \nfibrosis is present suggesting that this is a primary adenocarcinoma \nas opposed to a metastatic adenocarcinoma. A panel of \nimmunohistochemical stains is performed including CK7, CK20, CDX2, \nand TTF1 (with appropriate positive and negative controls). The \nneoplastic cells are strongly positive for CK7. The neoplastic \ncells demonstrate some scattered focal positive stain for CK20. The \nneoplastic cells demonstrate focal weakly positive staining TTF1. \nIn addition, the neoplastic cells demonstrate a rare focal positive \nstaining cell for CDX2. \nThis demonstrates a well differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma. \nThe subpleural fibrosis would suggest this represents a primary lung \nneoplasm, however, the immunohistochemical stains are equivocal and \ntherefore the possibility of a metastatic lesion cannot be fully \nexcluded on histologic grounds alone.

Below the hilum there is a finn tumour which measures 68 x 65 mm in \nmaximal dimension and has a finn sclerotic cut surface. Towards the superior aspect of this there is a \nfinn node which is adherent to the medial aspect of the tumour. Further enlarged nodes are present \nsurrounding the inferior aspect of the bronchial resection margin and pulmonary artery. The tumour \nabuts the pleural surface on this medial aspect but appears clear of the lateral aspect by approximately \n10 mm. On sectioning there are areas of necrosis and the tumour has a sclerotic cut face. Elsewhere \nthere is apical scarring. Distal to the tumour there is evidence of obstructive pneumonitis and in the \nbasal aspect of the lung there is a finn grey nodule.

[Blocked in toto, SA] \nMICROSCOPIC \nI: Sections show a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Patchy necrosis is present. \nVascular invasion is presenl but the pulmonary artery is clear of malignancy. No pleural, lymphatic or \nperineura l invasion is identified. The bronchial resection margin is clear of malignancy and shows no \nevidence of squamous metaplasia or dysplasia. Obstructive pneumonitis is confinned adjacent to the \ntumour. A way from the tumour there are at least three further distinct lesions. The first is the nodule \nnoted in the lower zone which comprises granulomatous inflammation including numerous giant cells \nof Langhans type with surround ing lymphocytic infiltration and fibrosis. A few tiny foci of necrosis \nare present within this nodule. There are [wo further foci of granulomatous inflammation with \nextensive central necrotic debris surrounded by foamy macrophag es and fibrosis. These appear to be \ncentred on bronchi. No organisms are identified in any of these lesions with Grocott or ZN stains. \nHowever the appearances are highly suspicious for infection, and I note that atypical Mycobacteria \nhave been found previously in sputum. The peribronchial lymph nodes are confmned to contain \nmetastatic squamous cell carcinoma, and they also have foci of fibrosis and dystrophic calcification, \nbut they show no evidence of granulomatous inflamma tion. \n2: Sections of the pulmonary artery show no evidence of malignancy . \n3: Sections of the lymph node show multiple silicotic nodules together with extensive sheets of \npigmented macrophages but there is no evidence of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma. \n4: Sections show lymph nodes with a follicular hyperplasia, sinus histiocytosis and aggregates of \npigmented macrophages.

The neoplastic cells have prominent \nnucleoli, and do not have the cytologic appearance of small \ncell carcinoma, grade II neuroendocrine carcinoma (atypical \ncarcinoid) or large cell neuroendocrine carCinoma. \nImmunohistochemical stains are performed. The neoplasm \nstains positively for cytokeratin CK7 as well as forTTF-1. \nThe neoplasm is negative for CK20, high molecular weight \nkeratin SK and p63. The findings support the diagnosis of .-\n_gdenocarcinoma of lung primary. There is weak staining for \nsynaptophysin. It 1s felt 1n that this is an example of \nnon-neuroendocrine carcinoma {adenocarcinoma) that shows \npositive staining for synaptophysin, and that it should not \nresult in classification of a neuroendocrine tumor. \nCurrent NCCN practice guidelines recommend determination of \nEGFR and KRAS mutation status in adenocarcinoma of lung to \nhelp select patients for Tyrosine-Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) \ntherapy. EGFR-activating mutations have been shown to be \nsignificantly associated with response to TKis and KRAS \nmutations are associated with TKI resistance. They are \nmutually exclusive in NSCLC. Additionally, recent data show \nthat ALK (Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase) gene rearrangements in \nadenocarcinoma of lung are associated with resistance to \nTKis and have favorable response rates to Crizotinib, the \nALK inhibitor agent currently in clinical trials. Mutation \nanalysis for KRAS and EGFR-TK domain and ALK gene \nrearrangement by FISH is available as the Lung Cancer \nMutation Panel. Testing may be performed on \nparaffin-embedded tissue from the primary or metastatic \ntumor or pleural fluid cell block.

Received fresh in a container labeled \"right upper \nlobe\" is a 296 gm, 17.8 x 11.8 x 4 em, lung lobe compatible \nwith right upper lobe. In the hilar region there is an 0.8 em long \nand 1.5 em in diameter bronchial stump which is grossly \nunremarkable. The vessels at the margin are also grossly \nunremarkable. There are some tan-gray lymph nodes up to 1.2 em in \ngreatest dimension in the hilar region. The pleural surface is \npink-purple with some anthracotic pigment deposition. There .is some \nretraction of the pleural surface. The specimen is sectioned, and \nthere is a 2.6 x 2 x 1.8 em rubbery tan-white mass underlying the \narea with pleural retraction1 with the mass suggestive of invading \nthe pleura. Approximately 2 em from this mass is a separate 4 x 3.5 \nx 3.1 ern rubbery tan-white mass. This mass approaches at least near \nto the pleural surface. The larger lesion has yellow-orange \ndiscoloration surrounding it, suggestive of surrounding pneumonia. \nThe remainder of the parenchyma is spongy and red-purple without \naddi tiona! lesions. RS-13, follmving fixation. \nBLOCK SUt~1ARY: Al -bronchial margini A2 -vascular margin; A3-A5 -\nfirst lesion described; A6-A9 -larger lesioni AlO -parenchyma \nsurrounding larger lesioni All-random lungi Al2 -two hilar lymph \nnodes; A13 -bisected hilar lymph node. \nGROSS DESCRIPTION \nB. Received fresh in a container labeled \"level 11\" are \ntwo pieces of soft red-gray tissue, 0.7 em in greatest \naggregate dimension. AS-1, following fixation. \nC. Received fresh in a container labeled \"2R\" are four \npieces of soft red-gray tissue, 3 em in greatest aggregate \ndimension. AS-2, following fixation. \nD. Received fresh in a container labeled \"4R\" are multiple \nsimilar fragments of tissue, in aggregate 2.7 x 1 x 0.5 em. \nAS-3, following fixation. \nE. Received fresh in a container labeled \"level 7\" is a \nsimilar portion of tissue, 1.5 em in greatest dimension. \nAS-2, following fixation. \nMICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION \nThe follm'ling template surrunarizes the findings in this \ncase: \nHistologic type: Both of the mass lesions consist of poorly \ndifferentiated non-small cell carcinoma. There are areas that it is \nfavored have squamous differentiation, as well as less frequent \nfoci suggestive of glandular differentiation (adenocarcinoma). \nAlthough not entirely identical, the two lesions look similar. \nHistologic grade: Poorly differentiated \nPrimary tumor (pT): These two lesions are grossly 2.6 em and 4 em \nin greatest dimension. The 2.6 em in diameter lesion has visceral \n pleural invasion, with the larger lesion extending very \nperipherally but without definite visceral pleural invasion. \nAlthough it is difficult to definitely distinguish between \nsynchronous primaries and the two masses being part of the same \nprocess, given the similarities in appearance, based on the new \nguidelines, two nodules of similar histology in the same lobe \nMICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION \nwould be classified as pT3, Clinical correlation is recommended. \nMargins of resection: The bronchial and vascular resection margins \nare negative. \nDirect extension of tumor: Visceral pleural extension for the 2.6 \nem in diameter lesion, no direct extension identified for the larger \nlesion. \nVascular invasion: Not definitively identified. \nRegional lymph nodes (pN): pNl. There is metastatic carcinoma in \none of three hilar lymph nodes in part A. The separately submitted \nlymph nodes in parts B, c, D, and E are negative for malignancy. \nDistant metastasis {pM} : pMX \nOther findings: There are inflammatory changes surrounding the \ntumors, with focally prominent pneumonia surrounding the larger \nlesion. \nNote: This case has been reviewed in Intradepartmental consultation \nwith all reviewers interpreting the two mass lesions as similar in \nappearance. \n3,4x3,5 \nDIAGNOSIS \nA.

The analytical sensitivity of\nthe assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low\npercentage of cells may not be detected.\nThis test is validated for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and\ncodon 13 mutations in fresh, frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin\nembedded tissue. In particular the test performance has been\nestablished in samples of colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung\ncarcinoma which harbor these mutations, although several other\ntissues are also known to harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of\npancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix, etc.).\nMETHOD/LIMITATIONS:\nTissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is\nselected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample ,quantified\nand amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to\nexon 2 of the KRAS gene .PCR products are subjected to single\nnucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;\nprimer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel\nelectrophoresis and fluorescence detection .False positive or\nnegative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants\nor somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.\nREFERENCES:\nNSCLC\nMascaux C, lannino N, et al.

Electronically signed by:\nDate:\nAddendum #1 performed by\nADDENDUM #2:\nINTEGRATED ONCOLOGY\nEGFR Mutation Analysis\nReferring Physician: .\nBody Site: Lung\nClinical Data :Adenocarcinoma\nRESULTS: No mutation detected.\nINTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified in the sample provided\nfor analysis .Fewer than 5% of non -small cell lung carcinoma\npatients without identifiable mutations are reported to be\nresponsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies. COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more tumor cellularity is optimal\nfor this mutation analysis .The sample submitted showed 80% tumor\ncellularity upon pathologist review.\nA frequently occurring sequence change 2361 G>A (Q787Q) was\nidentified. This polymorphism is known not to have clinical\nsignificance.\nMutations in the tyrosine domain of the epidermal growth factor\nreceptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with differential\nresponsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)\ntherapies. The objective response rate among patients with a\nsensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%.\nThis assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain;\nbased on the current literature, most mutations in non -small-cell\nlung carcinoma (NSCLC) are expected to occur in these exons.\nMutations present in less than 10-20% of extracted DNA may not be\ndetected by this method. Mutation status in a sample may change\nduring tumor progression or the course of therapy; therefore, this\nresult cannot be used to infer the presence or absence of a mutation\nin another sample or sub -sample obtained from this tumor.\nThis test is validated for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The\nclinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types\nis unknown.\nMETHOD/LIMITATION:\nTissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is\nselected for analysis .DNA is isolated from the samples, quantified\nand amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to\nexons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by\nbi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary gel\nelectrophoresis and fluorescence detection .False positive or\nnegative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants\nor somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.\nREFERENCES:\n1.Azzoli CG, et al, J.

C34.3 M 8255/3 G3.  \nComment/supplementary remark:   \nWithin the main tumor and the lymph node metastases, which are found within the lung in the \nparabronchial region, at the hilus and in sample 5, the large-cell solid tumor component, which has a partly clear -cell character, is predominant. Especially in the area of the main \ntumor margin and the surrounding area the carcinoma shows glandular tubulopapillary and bronchioloalveolar differentiation. No maturation pattern of squamous epithelium is evident on conventional histology (immunohistochemical analysis will follow to provide as definitive confirmation as possible of the bronchopulmonary origin of the tumor and thus exclusion of a late metastatic spread of the reported breast carcinoma). The RX category is explained by the fact that the tumor infiltrating the pleura and disseminated there extends as far as the pleural surface and, with the detection of carcinoma cells in the pleural effusions, the possibility cannot be excluded that some of them remained there. The central bronchus resection line and the resection margins of the large pulmonary vessels and the resection pr eparation of parietal \npleura itself, as registered under 4., are tumor- free \n  Result of immunohistochemical analysis: a major part of the tumor cells with double expression of low and high molecular weight keratins (M903 and 902). In the glandular differen tiation component, tumor cell nuclei are positive TTF1.  \n The immune profile confirms the diagnosis of an adenocarcinoma of the lung of mixed differentiation.  \n  \n",

However, based on the procedures performed (bronchoscopy and thoracoscopy), it could be a lung cancer or another type of lung mass.\n\nStage: The stage is not provided in the text, as it would require additional information such as the size of the mass and whether it has spread to nearby lymph nodes or other organs.\n\nGrade: The grade is also not provided in the given text. Grade refers to how abnormal the cancer cells look under a microscope and how quickly the cancer is likely to grow and spread.\n\nBehavior: The behavior of the mass cannot be determined without more information, such as whether it is benign or malignant.\n\nJustification for the choices: The site, laterality, stage, grade, and behavior are not explicitly provided in the text, and the histology can only be inferred based on the procedures performed.

Part A is submitted fresh for tissue procurement, \n             labeled \"lingula\".  It consists of an elongated portion of \n    lung tissue, measuring 18 x 4 x 2 cm. maximally.  It has been \n    amputated along an entire edge, which has steel clips and paper tape \n    present.  There is an area of pleural puckering opposite the tape, \n    which has drawn the pleura into a stellate- like area, with a \n    palpable mass deep to that.  The pleura is focally torn along \n    another portion of the specimen.  Black ink is applied over the area \n    of the scar and then the specimen is serially sectioned.  This \n    reveals the presence of a nodular tumor mass immediately beneath the \n    pleura, in the region of the above- mentioned scar.  That tumor mass \n    measures maximally 2 x 1.5 x 1.3 cm.  Sections through the remaining \n    pulmonary parenchyma reveal a consolidated bloody red tissue, \n    without other focal nodules present.  There is some adherent fat \n    present on the pleural surface.  Representative tumor and normal \n    ions are submitted for tissue procurement, per request of \n      Sections after fixation. \n      Part B is submitted fresh, labeled \"Level 10 lymph \n             node\".

Collection \nE. EML41ALK rearrangement NOT identified (see In Situ Procedure). \nNote: \nKRAS codon 12/13 mutations are found in approximately 10-30% lung adenoyarclnomas and associated with history of \nsmoking, The presence of KRAS mutation leads to resistance to EGFR ~ therapies (1). EGFR exon 19 and 21 \nmutations are present in about 10% of  and up to 40% in th..-,opulation, common in and \nassociated \nwith the clinical response to treatment with EGFR inhibitors (2). These mutations are mutually exciusive and \ntheir presence may have prognostic andlor therapeutic implications (3,4). Clinical studies show high EGFR gene copy \nnumber by FISH analysis (amplification) to be associated with favorable clinical benefit (clinical response, stable disease, \ntime to progression, and survival) In patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase \ninhibitors. \nApproximately 3% of lung adenocarcinomas within the Asian population have an interstitial deletion and inversion in \nchromosome 2p resulting in the EML4IALK fusion gene (ALK+) which is sensitive to AlK inhibitors (5,6). The prevalence \nof this abnormality in the Western population is stili unknown, Detection of this abnormality is critical for identifying \npatients eligible for therapies that target ALK enzymatic activity. EML41ALK rearrangements are mutually exclusive with \nKRAS and EGFR mutations. \nFINAL DIAGNOSIS: \nSUMMARY STATEMENT \nThe posterior segmentectomy demonstrates a 2.5 cm poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma associated with \nangiolymphatic and parietal pleural invasion. Metastatic adenocarcinoma is present in posterior and apical segment \nlevel 11, level 10 and level 5 lymph nodes. Surgical resection margins are free of tumor.

C34.2 M8255/3.  \nComment/supplementary remark:   \nThe tumor classification as adenocarcinoma of the lung showing a predominantl y \ntubulopapillary structural pattern still requires confirmation by appropriate \nimmunohistochemical analysis. The classification of the second small tumor focus as a (hematogenous) metastasis that \u2013 despite a certain difference in histoarchitecture and cel l \nmorphology in places \u2013 is based on the structure of the focus, which is lacking the fibrous remodeling or cicatricial zone here that is characteristic of a primary peripheral bronchopulmonary carcinoma. Vascular invasion can be seen in the intratumoral, thick -walled \npulmonary vessels of the larger tumor, where there is tumor spread with endobronchial occlusion in a subsegmental branch of the bronchus. The R1 classification is explained by the observation that the tumor glands invading the pleura extend as far as the outer surface of the pleura in places and the tumor cells thus remain in the pleural space.    Result of immunohistochemical analysis (both tumor foci)  \nCK7 positive throughout, CK20 negative. TTF1.positive (in the smaller focus more than in the larger one), only isolated tumor cells with delicate cell membrane staining for surfactant protein B.  This not only confirms that it is an adenocarcinoma of the lung and, but also supports the view that the smaller focus represents the metastasis of the larger focus  \nseen in 1.) and classified as primary tumor.  \n",

The report describes a tumor in the right upper lobe, which was identified as squamous cell carcinoma, keratinizing type, and moderately differentiated (G2). The stage was determined to be pT2aN0MX based on the size of the tumor (>3 em but <= 5 em), the absence of regional lymph node metastasis, and the inability to assess distant metastasis.

No preoperative tissue diagnosis . \nMACROSCOPIC \nOne specimen submitted. \nThe specimen is labelled 'left upper lobe wedge resection' and consists of a wedge oflung tissue, 130 x \n70 x 30 mm. The specimen bears a line of staples 110 mm in length. Protruding from one aspect of \nthe pleural surface is a palpable mass. The pleura is free and mobile over the mass. 35 mm away from \nthis lesion is a firm pleural plaque, 30 mm in diameter. Elsewhere the pleura shows some irregular \ngrey and white discolouration. Serial slicing reveals a well defined yellowish white tumour mass, 25 \nmm in greatest diameter, approximately 2 mm deep to the pleura. The cut surface shows small areas of \nyellowish necrosis. The tumour is at least 25 mm clear of the stapled surgical margin. No other lesions \nare identified. The uninvolved lung shows severe emphysema. The mass lesion has been sampled for \nMicrobiology and for  [IA-IB tumour with overlying pleura; lC-ID pleural _iir decalcification; IE-IF uninvolved lung parenchyma.] \nMICROSCOPY \nSections reveal a peripherally located moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma demonstrating \npredominantly acinar and focal solid architecture. The tumour is positive for CK7 and TTFI and \nnegative for CK20. Zones of geographic necrosis are evident within the confines of the tumour. The \ntumour does not involve the pleura and is macroscopically clear of the intraparenchyma l stapled \nmargin. No lymphatic or vascular invasion is identified and no perineural permeation by tumour is \nseen.

Part one is labeled 'right middle lobe nodule'. It consists of a\nwedge shaped portion of lung measuring 11 x 5 x 2 cm. There is a\nstaple line identified on the specimen, measuring 10 cm in length.\nThere is a cut identified on the specimen measuring 1.5 cm in\nlength. On further sectioning there is a gray white ill defined area\nmeasuring 1.1 x 1 cm is identified. This area is 0.3 cm from the\nstaple line and 0.4 cm from the pleural surface. The staple line is\ninked blue. Further sectioning of the lung reveals spongy tan maroon\nparenchyma. One portion from the ill defined area is submitted for\nfrozen section analysis. Representative sections are submitted.\n2. Part two is labeled 'station #9 lymph node'. It consists of a\nsingle lymph node measuring 2.4 x 1.5 x 1 cm. The cut surface is\ngrey-black. Entirely submitted in one cassette.\n3. Part three is labeled 'station #10 lymph node'. It consists of\nmultiple irregular fragments of grey-black lymph nodes measuring 1.5\nx 0.8 x 0.5 cm in aggregate. Entirely submitted in one cassette.\n4. Part four is labeled 'completion of right middle lobectomy'. It\nconsists of a lobe of lung measuring 10.5 x 5.5 x 2 cm and weighing\n38 grams. Two staple lines, measuring 8 cm and 6 cm in length are\nnoted. The bronchial and vascular margins are identified. The\nserosal surface is grey-purple and shows a subpleural grey-black\nnodule measuring 0.9 x 0.8 cm. Sectioning reveals an unremarkable red beefy lung parenchyma. The subpleural nodule likely represents\nthe lymph node. No discrete mass lesions are noted. Representative\nsections are submitted.\n5. Part five is labeled 'station #4 lymph node'.

The pathologist whose\nsignature appears below reviewed the original pathology report,\nexamined candidate H&E slides, and selected block 1 A appropriate to\nthe specifications of the ordered molecular analysis. xl H&E and x9\nunstained slides were prepared and forwarded to\nwhere the subject molecular test will be performed. An\naddendum report will be issued when the results.of this molecular\ntest are available.\nAddendum #1performed by\nADDENDUM #2:\nMOLECULAR ONCOLOGY\nKRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS\nReferring Physician\nBody Site :Right middle lobe of lung\nSpecimen Type: Slides\nClinical Data :Adenocarcinoma\nRESULTS: Wild-type gene.\nINTERPRETATION:\nNo mutations were identified at codons 12 and 13 of the KRAS gene.\nCOMMENT:\nMutations in the KRAS gene are reported to be associated with poor prognosis ,and resistance to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor\ntherapies in patients with non -small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). KRAS\nmutations occur in 15-30% of NSCLC patients and are strongly\nassociated with adenocarcinoma and smoking history.\nThis assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;\nbased on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are\nexpected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of\nthe assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low\npercentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated\nfor use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and codon 13 mutations in\nfresh, frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue. In\nparticular the test performance has been established in samples of\ncolorectal cancer and non-small cell lung carcinoma which harbor\nthese mutations, although several other tissues are also known to\nharbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of pancreas, bile duct, ovary,\nappendix, etc.).\nAnalysis of EGFR mutation or gene amplification status may provide\nadditional information regarding this patient's probability of\nresponse to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies, if\nclinically indicated. See references.\nMETHOD/LIMITATION:\nTissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is\nselected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified\nand amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to\nexon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single\nnucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;\nprimer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel\nelectrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or\nnegative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants\nor somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.\nREFERENCES:\nNSCLC\nMascaux C, lannino N, et al.

COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more tumor cellularity is optimal\nfor this mutation analysis. The sample submitted showed 70% tumor\ncellularity upon pathologist review.\nA frequently occurring sequence change 2361>GA (Q787Q) was\nidentified .This polymorphism is known not to have clinical\nsignificance.\nMutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth\nfactor receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with\ndifferential responsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase\ninhibitor (TKI) therapies. The objective response rate among\npatients with a sensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%.\nThis assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain;\nbased on the current literature ,most mutations in non -small-cell\nlung carcinoma (NSCLC) are expected to occur in these exons.\nMutations present in less than 10-20 %of extracted DNA may not be\ndetected by this method .Mutation status in a sample may change\nduring tumor progression or the course of therapy; therefore, this\nresult cannot be used to infer the presence or absence of a mutation\nin another sample or sub-sample obtained from this tumor.\nThis test is validated for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The\nclinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types\nis unknown.\nMETHOD:\nTissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is\nselected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified\nand amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to\nexons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by\nbi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary gel\nelectrophoresis and fluorescence detection.

When a rearrangement involving ALK is\npresent, either inversion or translocation, one of the two fusion\nsignals separates as one red and one green signal. In this\nspecimen, separated signals were present in 0% of the nuclei scored.\nThis result is within the normal limits.\nCOMMENTS: Three to four copies of ALK were observed in 26.0% of\ncells. This gain of intact ALK fusion hybridization signals\nrepresents an aneuploid population with extra copies of chromosome\n2/2p ALK region .Additional copies of ALK are not uncommon in\nNSCLCs, although the significance of extra copies of the ALK gene in\nlung carcinoma is unclear at this time (Salido M. et al.

Fibrinous chronic granulating and fibrosing visceral (sample 1.)) \nand parietal pleuritis (sample 2.)). Uncharacteristic chronic, predominantly interstitial inflammation and fibrosis \nassociated with focal fibrous and small honeycomb-like parenchyma remodeling along the ventrobasalmargin \nof 88. Subpleural accentuated intraalveolar macrophage accumulation in 810 (sample !.)). Lymph nodes with \nuncharacteristic reactive lesions and anthracotic pigment deposits (samples 1.) and 3.)-9.)). \nRemark/addendum: \nAn unequivocal infiltration of the visceral pleura cannot be found. The resection margin of the bronchus and \nvessels and all lymph nodes ideutified and excised are tumor-free. \nNo asbestos bodies are found in the prepared section planes. But very much further-reaching investigations, \nespecially dust analyses, are needed to determine the asbestos exposure of the lung. ",
