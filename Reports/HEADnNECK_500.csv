)"," Site: Multiple sites including left constrictor muscle, soft palate margin, lateral pharyngeal margin, left tongue base margin, posterior tonsillar pillar margin, and left radical tonsillectomy. Justification: The report includes separate descriptions for each specimen received, indicating different surgical margins and the main tumor site.

Laterality: Left side of the oral cavity and oropharynx. Justification: All the sites and specimens mentioned in the report are from the left side, indicating that the surgery was performed on the left side.

Histology: Squamous cell carcinoma. Justification: The report mentions ""in situ carcinoma"" and ""invasive carcinoma,"" which are types of squamous cell carcinoma. Additionally, the tumor cells are strongly positive for p16, indicating a high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, which is commonly associated with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.

Stage: Not provided. Justification: The report does not include information about the size of the tumor or the presence of metastasis, which are necessary for determining the stage of the cancer.

Grade: Not provided. Justification: The report does not include information about the differentiation of the tumor cells, which is necessary for determining the grade of the cancer.

Behavior: Malignant. Justification: The report mentions ""in situ carcinoma"" and ""invasive carcinoma,"" indicating that the tumor has the potential to invade surrounding tissues and metastasize, which is characteristic of malignant behavior.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

specimen is approximately 10.5'cm from anterior to posterior x
4.7 cm lateral to midline x 5.2 cm from superior to inferior.
The mandible is transected posteriorly through the ramus
resulting in two surgical margins, 1 superior and 1 anterior
(2.5 and 2.1 cm each). The anterior mandibular margin is 3.0 cm.
The mandible is notable for two teeth present anteriorly
immediately posterior to the second tooth. The tumor extends
6.0 cm from anterior to posterior and 2.2 cm from lateral edge
to midline. There is a tan firm mass, centered on the mandible and extending
into the buccal mucosa. The mucosal margins are differentially
inked anterior/lateral/posterior edge/black, anterior midline
and posterior edge/blue. The surrounding soft tissue lateral
inferior midline and posterior is inked green. The mass at its
closest approach to the mucosal margins is 0.4 cm from the blue
inked midline, black inked anterior, black inked posterior, and
is greater than 1 cm from the black inked lateral edge.
Along the inner edge of the mandible, there are four palpable
lymph nodes, ranging from 0.5 to 3.0 cm. The lymph nodes lift
freely from the bone of the mandible and are surrounded by
yellow lobulated fat and yellow lobulated glandular tissue. The
tissue along the lateral edge of the mandible is comprised of
red/brown muscle. The mass on section comes to within 0.5 cm of
this muscle.
Sectioning reveals that the mass extends into the mandible,
coming to within 2.5 cm of the anterior bone margin and greater
than 4 cm from the posterior bone margin.
A portion of tumor is submitted to tissue procurement.
A photograph of the specimen is taken.

Gross Description
Specimen A is received fresh in a container labeled with the patient's name, medical record number and identified as
""total laryngectomy."" The specimen consists of a total laryngectomy specimen measuring 9.3 x 5.2 x 4.3 cm in total
dimension from the tip of the epiglottis to the inferior tracheal edge with attached hyoid bone measuring 9.5 x 0.5 x
0.7 cm and the left thyroid lobe measuring 4.1 x 3.3 x 2.2 cm. The larynx is opened posteriorly on the midline at the
time of frozen section analysis. There are three tracheal rings attached.
There is a tan -white appearing mass measuring 2.5 x 1.9 cm in surface area and 2.2 cm in thickness involving the
glottic larynx. The mass is grossly located on the bilateral false cord, vestibule true cord and crosses the midline.
The mass does not appear to involve pyriform sinus. Grossly, the mass extends 2.4 cm from the tip of the epiglottic
mucosal edge, 2.3 cm from the base of the tongue mucosal edge, 2.4 cm from the lateral right mucosal edge, 1.1 cm
from the lateral left mucosal edge and 3.1 cm from the distal tracheal edge. None of the tracheal rings grossly
appear involved the mass. On the anterior aspect of the specimen is an ellipse of abnormal skin measuring 4.5 x 4.3
x 1.0 cm. The inferior aspect of the skin ellipse measures 2.3 cm from the distal tracheal edge. A tan-white, irregular
ulceration is identified measuring 2.2 x 1.7 cm and is present 2.5 cm from the inferior skin edge, 1.6 cm from the left
skin edge, 1.1 cm from the right skin edge and 0.9 cm from the superior skin edge. The skin defect grossly does not
appear to communicate with the mass lesion. There is a left lobe of the thyroid gland present. The cut surface is
homogenous and beefy red. A colloid nodule measuring 1.3 x 1.1 x 0.5 cm is noted. On sectioning, the lesion
grossly invades the anterior commissure as well as the pre-epiglottic space as well as possible full thickness invasion
of the thyroid cartilage. Sections are taken as listed in the cassette summary after decalcification. Representative
section of tumor is submitted for Tumor Bank at the time of frozen section analysis. The specimen is inked as listed
in the inking code. Dictated by

"," Site: Oral Cavity
The report includes descriptions and measurements of specimens from various sites in the oral cavity, including the right tongue posterior margin, right buccal posterior lateral margin, right buccal anterior lateral margin, and right floor of mouth.

Laterality: Right
The tumor is located on the right side of the oral cavity, as indicated by the specimens from the right tongue, right buccal mucosa, and right perifacial lymph node.

Histology: Squamous cell carcinoma
Although not explicitly stated in the report, the description of a ""tumor"" and the mention of histologic grade suggest that the diagnosis is squamous cell carcinoma.

Stage: pT3 pN2b
The tumor is classified as pT3 due to its greatest dimension of more than 4 cm, and as pN2b due to metastasis in multiple ipsilateral lymph nodes, none more than 6 cm in greatest dimension.

Grade: G2 (Moderately differentiated)
The tumor is moderately differentiated, which means that it has intermediate characteristics between well-differentiated and poorly differentiated tumors.

Behavior: Malignant
The report indicates a diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma, which is a malignant tumor that can invade surrounding tissues and metastasize to distant sites.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST),,III (high grade),malignant,TCGA-HD-8224.pdf,   ," Report: 
The sample consists of a fragment of soft tissue measuring 3.5 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm. Microscopic examination reveals features consistent with a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST), WHO Grade III. No specific sites of origin are identified, but the lesion is abutting and possibly arising from a nerve bundle. There is no evidence of residual schwannoma or neurofibroma within this sample. The specimen shows focal areas of tumor necrosis. Mitotic activity is brisk (>10 mitoses/10 high power fields). Surgical margins are widely involved by the tumor. No lymphovascular invasion is identified.

1. ""Site"": not provided, as the report does not specify a clear site of origin for the tumor.
2. ""Laterality"": not provided, as the report does not mention whether the tumor is on the left or right side.
3. ""Histology"": malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST), as stated in the report. (""The lesion is abutting and possibly arising from a nerve bundle and shows features consistent with a MPNST, WHO Grade III."")
4. ""Stage"": not provided, as the TNM stage requires information on the size of the tumor, lymph node involvement, and metastasis, which are not all given in this report.
5. ""Grade"": Grade III (high grade), as stated in the report. (""Features consistent with a MPNST, WHO Grade III."")
6. ""Behavior"": malignant, as indicated by the tumor being widely invasive and having brisk mitotic activity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

_______________________________________________________________ 
GROSS DESCRIPTION: The specimen is received in 5 parts. 
Part 1 is received fresh labeled with the patient's name, initials xx 
and 
""right supraglottic lesion"".  Received are 2, irregular, soft to 
rubbery, tan, 
 tissue biopsies each measuring 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm.  A touch prep is 
performed 
with an intraoperative diagnosis completed. The specimen is entirely 
submitted 
for processing in a cassette labeled 1A.  
Part 2 is received fresh labeled with the patient's name, initials xx and 
""right zone 2B node"".  Received is a single, tan, oval, soft to 
rubbery, lymph 
node measuring 0.5 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm.  The specimen is inked, bisected and 
entirely submitted for processing in a cassette labeled 2A.  
Part 3 is received fresh labeled with the patient's name, initials xx 
and 
""right neck level 2, 3, and 4"".  Received is an irregular unoriented 13 
x 4.5 
x 1.3 cm right selective neck dissection, presumably lymph node levels 
2 
through 4 without an orienting suture.  Neck dissection is divided 
equally 
into 3 segments.  The measurements for the lymph node- containing soft 
tissue 
levels are as follows: Level A- 4.2 X 3.5 X 1.5 cm, level B-  4.3 x 4 x 
1.0 cm, 
and level C-  4 x 3.2 x 1.5 cm.  Multiple lymph nodes, ranging from 0.2 
to 2.0 
cm in greatest dimension are identified.  Several of the larger lymph nodes 
appear to be tumor involved and are present in greater numbers within 
level A. 
  Lymph nodes are entirely submitted in cassettes labeled: 
3A - level A -  six possible lymph nodes 
3B - level A- six possible lymph nodes 
3C - level A - single bisected lymph node 
3D - level A single bisected lymph node 
3E - level B- seven possible lymph nodes 
3F - level C- 9 possible lymph nodes 
Part 4 is received fresh labeled with the patient's name, initials xx 
and 
""left neck level 2, 3 and 4"".  Received is an irregular unoriented 11.5 
x 6 x 
1.2 cm left selective neck dissection, presumably lymph node levels 2 through 
4 without an orienting suture.  Neck dissection is divided equally into 
3 
segments.  The measurements for the lymph node- containing soft tissue 
levels are as follows: Level A- 4.3 X 3.5 X 1.25 cm, level B-  5.5 x 3.1 x 0.8 
cm, and level C-  4 x 3 x 1.2 cm.  Multiple lymph nodes, ranging from 0.2 to 2.0 
cm in greatest dimension are identified.  Several of the larger lymph nodes appear 
to be tumor involved and are present in greater numbers within level A.   
Lymph nodes are entirely submitted in cassettes labeled: 
4A - level A -  four possible lymph nodes 
4B - level A-  single possible lymph node 
4C  level B-  seven lymph node  4D  level B - one lymph node 
4E - level C- eight possible lymph nodes 
4F - level C- three possible lymph nodes 
Part 5 is received fresh labeled with the patient's name, initials xx 
and 
""larynx"".   The specimen consists of total laryngectomy measuring 8.5 cm 
(superior to inferior), by 4.2 cm (anterior to posterior), by 5.8 cm 
(width) 
when reconstructed.  The specimen includes the hyoid bone which is 
removed.  
The hyoid bone measures 8.2 cm in length by 0.3 x 0.3 cm in greatest 
dimension.  One tracheal ring is identified.  There is a supraglottic 
irregular exophytic ulcerated mass measuring at least 2.8 x 2.2 cm in 
maximal 
dimension.  The tumor is centered at the level of the supraglotttis and more 
prominent and cavitary toward the right side.  The tumor appears to 
compress/invade the right and left false vocal cords as well as the 
anterior 
pyriform sinus.  The tumor is grossly located at 1.3 cm from the right arytenoid mucosal margin, 1.8 cm from the left arytenoid margin, 3.0 cm 
from 
the epiglottic margin and at 3.2 cm from the jugular margin (inferior).  
The 
anterior soft tissue margin appears intact and no gross lesion is identified.  
Upon sectioning the tumor measures 4.8 cm superior to inferior by 3.2 cm 
anterior to posterior, by 4.5 cm in width.  It involves the pre-
epiglottic space, paraglottic space and anterior soft tissue.  The tumor appears 
to 
superficially invade the thyroid cartilage as well as epiglottic 
cartilage.  
The anterior soft tissue margin including muscle and fibroadipose tissue 
appears uninvolved by tumor.  The right thyroid lobe is identified 
measuring 
3.2 x 2.5 x 0.8 cm in greatest dimension.  No parathyroid tissue is 
identified.  On section no discrete, well circumscribed or ill defined 
lesions 
en.  A section of the tumor was selected and   
 
i red and banked.  The specimen is submitted in fourteen cassettes as follows: 
5A  epiglottic margin, perpendicular 
5B  tracheal (deep) margin, shaved 
5C  right arytenoid margin, perpendicular 
5D  left arytenoid margin, perpendicular 5E  right anterior soft tissue margin  (area inked blue is not a 
margin)  
5F  tumor and thyroid cartilage right side 
5G  supraglottic tumor area right side 
5H  - ventricle tumor area right side 
5I  anterior soft tissue margin left side 
 5J  tumor and epiglottic cartilage 
5K  ventricle tumor area left side 
5L  tumor and thyroid cartilage left side 
5M  5N  representative section of thyroid gland.  
On Part 5 cassettes A, B, F, H, J and L will be placed in decalcifying

Microscopic Discussion:
Sections demonstrate a paraganglioma characterized by a proliferation of monotonous cells with round
nuclei and salt and pepper chromatin, prominent red nucleoli and esoinophilic cytoplasm. These cells
are arranged in small nests surrounded by a delicate capillary network. One mitotic figure per 10 high-
power fields is identified. Bands of fibroelastic tissue intersect the tumor cells. Few entrapped nerve
fibers are also seen. Necrosis is not identified.

"," Site: The specimens are from various sites including the right and left neck dissections, base of tongue, left lateral pharynx, and larynx. This is necessary to examine the extent of the malignancy.

Laterality: The tumors are located on both sides of the body, with one on the right laryngectomy and the other on the glottic segment of the left laryngectomy. This information is crucial for determining the appropriate treatment.

Histology: Both tumors are moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinomas. This type of cancer is common in the head and neck region, and the histological grade helps determine the aggressiveness of the tumor.

Stage: The right laryngectomy tumor is staged as pT3 pN2c, indicating a relatively advanced stage of cancer with positive lymph nodes. The left glottic tumor is staged as pT1a pN0, indicating an early-stage cancer without positive lymph nodes.

Grade: Both tumors are moderately differentiated, which suggests an intermediate level of aggressiveness. This information is important for determining the prognosis and appropriate treatment.

Behavior: The behavior of the tumor is malignant, as it is a cancer that can invade surrounding tissues and metastasize to other parts of the body. This information is crucial for determining the appropriate treatment and follow-up care.

Not provided: Other categories such as chemoradiation therapy, organ transplant, immunosuppression, and cytogenetics tests are not provided in the report. These factors can influence the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, and it is important to obtain this information from the medical record or the treating physician.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 "," Site: Multiple sites in the mouth and neck
Laterality: Right side of the mouth and right lymph nodes
Histology: Squamous cell carcinoma or similar (based on H&E staining)
Stage: pT2, pN0, M0, indicating a stage II cancer (not provided: TNM status post-chemoradiation therapy)
Grade: Not provided (requires additional histologic features not given in the report)
Behavior: Malignant (invasive carcinoma)

Justification: The site is determined from the procedure and specimen description, which includes lymph nodes and multiple sites in the mouth. Laterality is specified as right for most of the specimens. Histology is assumed to be squamous cell carcinoma based on the H&E staining mentioned in the report. Stage is determined using the pTNM classification, with T2 from the procedure description (lesion >2 cm but not through the cortical layer), N0 (no regional lymph node involvement found), and M0 (no distant metastasis). Grade requires additional histologic features not provided in the report. The behavior is malignant based on the diagnosis of carcinoma.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1. Site: Lung - Justification: The report explicitly states that the sample was obtained from the lung.
2. Laterality: Not provided - Justification: There is no mention of laterality in the report.
3. Histology: Adenocarcinoma - Justification: The report clearly mentions a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.
4. Stage: T2 N0 M0 - Justification: The tumor invaded the visceral pleura (T2), but no lymph node or distant metastasis was found (N0, M0).
5. Grade: II - Justification: The report describes the adenocarcinoma as moderately differentiated, which corresponds to Grade II.
6. Behavior: Malignant - Justification: The tumor is invasive, growing into the visceral pleura, indicating malignant behavior.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Other significant findings: The carcinoma is deeply invasive into the skeletal muscle within the hemiglossectomy. The tumor extends far anteriorly, very close to the anterior tip. In the 
anterior tip, the carcinoma is present beneath an intact surface 
squamous mucosa.  AJCC PATHOLOGIC TNM STAGE: pT4a pN2b 
 
NOTE: This pathologic stage assessment is based on information available at the time of this report, and is subject to change 
pending clinical review and additional information. 
  Comment: 
The frozen section diagnoses are confirmed. 
 
The surgical resection margins are free of definite involvement 
by tumor. The tumor does extend deeply into the muscle of the 
hemiglossectomy specimen and extends far anteriorly. An anterior 
tip section was taken and submitted en face initially which revealed a focus of submucosal invasive squamous cell carcinoma. 
This section is subsequently bisected and submitted as 
perpendicular sections revealing the invasive carcinoma to be present beneath an intact anterior surface squamous mucosa. The inked true margins in the anterior tip section are negative for 
definite tumor.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:  
The specimen is received fresh in four parts labeled with the patient's  name,  
initials xx and medical record number.  Part 1 is designated ""right level 1B neck dissection"".  It consists of a  
submandibular gland (3 x 2.5 x 2 cm) and attached fibroadipose tissue (6.5 x  
4.5 x 2.5 cm).  The cut surface of the gland is tan -white a nd multilobated.  
Four lymph nodes are identified in the fibroadipose tissue varying in size  
from 1.2 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm to 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm.  Representative sections are  
submitted as follows:  
1A  submandibular gland  
1B  one lymph node bisected  
1C  two lymph  nodes  
1D  two lymph nodes.  
Part 2 is designated ""right hemiglossectomy"".  The specimen measures 7 x 6 x  
 3.5 cm overall.  The lateral surface shows two ulcers measuring 3.5 x 2.5 cm  
(ulcer #1) and 1.5 x 1 cm (ulcer #2), respectively.  The larger ulcer is 1 cm  
from the anterior margin, 1.4 cm from the dorsal/deep margin and 1.1 cm away  
from the ventral/deep margin.  The smaller ulcer is 0.5 cm away from the  
dorsal/deep margin and 2.5 cm away from the ventral/deep margin and 0.5 cm  
from the posterior margin.   All the margins were evaluated intraoperatively.  
On serial sectioning, the larger ulcer shows a tan white mass (1.2 cm deep).  
The smaller ulcer also shows a tan white mass (0.2 cm in depth).  The two  
masses grossly appear to be continuous with each othe r.

I have personally reviewed all specimens and or slides ,including the
listed special stains, and used them with my medical judgement to
determine the final diagnosis.
CLINICAL HISTORY:
The patient is a -year-old female with tonsil cancer .Operative
Procedure: Right radical tonsillectomy with right neck dissection.
GROSS:
Six containers are received ,each labeled with the patient's name, and medical record number.
A. The first container is received fresh and subsequently received in formalin and additionally labeled ""A - right tonsil .""The specimen
consists of a 4 .1 x 4.0 x 2 .3 cm radical tonsillectomy specimen. The
surgeon was present in the gross room and oriented the specimen. The
specimen is also oriented with a stitch at superior aspect. The
specimen is inked as follows :superior =orange ,inferior = blue,
anterior =green ,posterior =red and deep =black .A 1.6 x 0.7 cm
tan-white ,well-defined ulcer is present on the mucosal surface, which
is 0.9 cm to the closest inferior margin .Sectioning reveals a 2.5 x
1.7 x 1.5 cm white firm well- defined mass deep to the ulcer within the
submucosal tissue .This mass is less than 0 .1 cm to deep margin, 0.2 cm
to anterior ,0.7 cm to posterior, 1.0 cm to superior and 0.6 cm to
inferior margin respectively. Representative sections of the mass were
procured for potential future studies .Remainder of tissue is entirely
submitted.

A3-A4 - inferior margin ,perpendicular.
AS-All - remainder of tissue sequentially proceeding from superior to
inferior aspect related to anterior random posterior margins.
B.The next container is additionally labeled ""B - right
parapharyngeal margin."" The specimen consists of four yellow-red
fibroadipose tissues measuring ranging from 0.3 to 0.7 cm in greatest
dimension and 1.0 x 0 .5 x 0.2 cm in aggregate .Entirely wrapped in Al. C. Thenext container is labeled ""C - right 2A .""The specimen
consists of a 4.3 x 3 .5 x 1.7 cm portion of yellow -red firm fibroadipose
tissue .Sectioning reveals a 3.8 x 3 .2 x 2.0 cm white firm mass with
solid cut surface. Also two lymph nodes measuring 0.8 and 1.0 cm in
greatest dimension are noted. Representative sections are submitted.
Summary of Sections:
C1- largest firm mass.
C2-C3 - one lymph node in each.
D. The next container is labeled ""D - right level 3."" The specimen
consists of a 4.5 x 2.5 x 0.7 cm portion of yellow-red fibroadipose
tissue .Sectioning reveals six lymph nodes ranging from 0.3 to 2.0 cm
in greatest dimension .All lymph nodes are entirely submitted.
Summary of Sections:
D1-D3 - one lymph node in each.
D4 - three lymph nodes.
E.The next container is labeled ""E - right 2B."" The specimen

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A)Received fresh designated ""right level II"" is a 2.1 x 1.1 x 0.4 cm piece
of fibrofatty tissue, which is bisected parallel to the long axis. Specimen
has a pale tan cut surface. Entirely submitted in Al.
B)Received in a container of formalin labeled ""..., right neck dissection""
is a 10 x 4.8 x 2 cm yellow lobulated portion of fibrofatty tissue. There is
a double suture attached to the level II region and a single suture attached
to the level IV region. The specimen is sectioned and in the level II region
there is a 4.5 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm tan lobulated salivary gland. It is serially
sectioned and has tan lobulated cut surfaces. No masses or lesions are
identified. The specimen is divided into levels II, III, IV, and V. In the
level II region there is a 2 x 2 x 1 cm previously incised tan-gray friable
apparent grossly involved lymph node. The remaining regions are sectioned
and have fibrofatty cut surfaces and numerous candidate lymph nodes are
identified ranging from 0.1-2.5 cm in greatest dimension. No additional
metastatic disease is grossly appreciated. Representative sections are
submitted as follows: B1 - salivary gland; B2 - sections of grossly involved
level II lymph node; B3 - two level II bisected lymph nodes, one inked blue;
B4 - three level III candidate lymph nodes; B5 - seven level IV candidate
lymph nodes; B6 - one bisected level IV lymph node; B7 - four level V
candidate lymph nodes; B8 - four level V candidate lymph nodes; B9 - one
bisected level V lymph node; B10 - one bisected level V lymph node.
C)Received fresh designated ""right level V"" is one piece of yellow
fibrofatty tissue measuring 4 x 2 x 0.5 cm. The specimen is examined for
potential lymph nodes and seven potential lymph node candidates are
identified. The largest candidate is inked black and bisected, and all lymph
node candidates are submitted in cassette Cl.
D)Received fresh designated ""inferior margin"" is a 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm
piece of whitish red fibrous tissue, which is inked black and entirely
submitted for frozen section analysis, after which it is thawed and submitted
in cassette
E)Received fresh designated ""right composite resection, single stitch
anterior lateral, double stitch posterior medial"" is a 5.8 x 5.2 x 5.4 cm
composite resection including a portion of the bony maxilla with three teeth,
the soft tissue lateral to the mandible, and associated soft tissue superior
to the mandible including a portion of a lower molar (mandibular bone is not
present). The buccal surface of the oral cavity, lateral to the teeth, has
an exophytic, friable lesion which extends along the posterior mucosal
surface to the medial aspect of the specimen where it is present medial to
the upper and lower teeth. Grossly, this exophytic lesion is at least 2.5 x
3.5 x 2.5 cm on initial examination. The egdes of the lesion are grossly 0.5
cm from the posterior mucosal margin, 0.8 cm from the inferior mucosal
margin, 0.5 cm from the anterior mucosal margin, and 0.5 cm from the superior
mucosal margin. On initial gross examination, this lesion does not appear to
extend through the fibrofatty tissue located lateral to the buccal surface. Using the orientation provided per surgeon (single stitch anterior lateral,
double stitch posterior medial), the mucosal margins are inked in the
following manner: anterior = blue; superior = black; medial = red; inferior
= green. The lateral soft tissue margin is inked orange, the inferior soft
tissue is inked green, the superior soft tissue is inked black, the medial
soft tissue is inked red, and the posterior soft tissue margin is inked blue
over green. Representative shave margins are taken from the inferior and
anterior mucosal surfaces. The specimen is then cut in a transverse plane,
separating the maxilla from the mandibular soft tissue, and each piece is
serially sectioned. The tumor has a firm white cut surface, with friable
areas, and grossly extends to within 0.1 mm of the deep inked margin (blue
over green), within 0.1 cm of the inked medial soft tissue margin (red),
within 0.1 cm of the inked lateral soft tissue margin (orange),and within 0.2
cm of the inferior soft tissue margin (green). On sectioning, the tumor
appears larger than on original examination, and measures 4.5 x 4.0 x 2.5 cm.
The upper maxillary bone is focally sectioned and has foci suspicious for
bony involvement; these areas are submitted for decalcification.
Cassette summary: El - representative shave margins from the inferior and
anterior mucosal margins; E2 - representative perpendicular margins from the
medial and superior mucosal margins; E3 - representative sections of neoplasm
in relationship to deep soft tissue margin; E4 - relationship of neoplasm and
closest medial soft tissue margin; E5 - relationship of neoplasm and closest
lateral soft tissue margin; E6 - relationship of neoplasm and superior soft
tissue margin; E7 - representative sections of superior upper lateral mucosa
in relationship to inked mucosal margin; E8 - relationship of neoplasm and
inferior inked margin; E9-E10 - composite cross section through neoplasm;
Ell- E12 - upper maxillary bone..

COMMENT: The tumor lesion in the pyriform sinus corresponds to AJCC stage       IVA (pT2, N2b, MX). Assuming the tumor in the base of the tongue        represents a separate lesion, it corresponds to AJCC stage II (pT2).    
 Although the lesion in specimen 9 is noted to extend to an inked edge, the      
final surgical margins of resection, represented separately, are negative       
for malignancy.         **Electronically Signed Out by

Received fresh labeled, ""larynx, pharynx, thyroid, level 6 lymph nodes,"" is     
a 9.0 x 4.5 x 3.5 cm laryngeal specimen. The specimen is inked as follows:      left-blue, right-black. After inking the specimen, the anterior larynx is       opened to reveal all structures described. Within the specimen, there is a      5.5 x 3.4 x 2.5 cm left pharynx. The epiglottis measures 3.5 x 3.0 x 0.2 cm     with a pink-tan mucosal surface. Distal to the epiglottis are the bilateral     arytenoids, which measure 2.1 x 0.8 x 0.7 cm on the left and 1.5 x 0.9 x        0.5 cm on the right. Both arytenoids are pink-tan and soft with no gross        abnormalities. The false vocal cords measure 2.0 cm on the left and 1.5 cm      on the right. Distal to the false vocal cords are the bilateral ventricles      and true vocal cords. The true vocal cords measure 1.8 cm on the left and       2.0 cm on the right. Bilateral false and true vocal cords are pink-tan in       color. Distal to the true vocal cords is the subglottis, which leads to the     trachea. There is a 2.6 cm portion of trachea removed with the specimen.        The posterior surface of the specimen contains the hyoid bone, which is identified superiorly to the horns of the cricoid cartilage. The horn of        the left cricoid cartilage is not grossly visible. The left piriform sinus      contains a nodular pink-tan lesion that measures 3.5 x 3.0 cm. The lesion       involves the entire piriform sinus. On the posterior side of the specimen,      there is muscle tissue identified and a vein that measures 9.5 x 3.5 cm.        The vein is clipped at both ends. The left lobe of the thyroid is       identified and measures 3.5 x 2.6 x 0.8 cm. Also removed distal to the  thyroid gland are the level 6 lymph nodes. The level 6 tissue is removed        from the specimen and thoroughly examined for lymph nodes. There are    multiple palpable lymph nodes. Approximately 12 possible lymph nodes are        identified and entirely submitted. The largest presumed lymph node measures     2.0 x 0.8 x 0.8 cm. It is bisected to reveal a cystic cavity filled with        thick white fluid. The thyroid is removed from the specimen and serially        sectioned to reveal a red-brown, gritty parenchyma with a mucoid surface.       There is a 0.1 cm firm, white nodule within the parenchyma approaching the      isthmus. There is no gross evidence of tumor. Representative sections of        the thyroid are submitted. The soft tissue on the posterior aspect of the       specimen is removed. The identified vein prior to inking is removed and the     remaining tissue is serially sectioned to reveal grossly normal muscle and      cartilage tissue. While sectioning the specimen, a lymph node is identified     that measures 2.0 x 1.1 x 0.2 cm. The remaining tissue on the possible  posterior larynx is thoroughly examined and one additional presumed  lymph      node is identified. The remaining tissue is grossly normal. Both lymph  nodes are entirely submitted. The piriform sinus is serially sectioned  while attached to the remaining specimen. The tumor is less than 0.1 cm to      the posterior margin, 0.1 cm from the superior margin, and 1.5 cm from the      inferior margin. The lesion is 2.0 cm thick.

opposite clamp, remainder of nerve with blue ink at end with clamp.
*FS/DX: PERIPHERAL NERVE,NO TUMOR PRESENT.
(D)LEFT HEMIMANDIBULECTOMY - A left hemimandibulectomy specimen ,the ramus
is 9.5 cm and the mandible is 9.3 cm. A 3.5 x 2.6 x 1.5 cm unremarkable
submandibular gland is present. An 11.0 x 6.0 cm ellipse of tan, hair-bearing
skin is present over the lateral aspect of the specimen. A 2.5 x 2.0 cm area
of bulging and ulceration is present in the center of the skin.
A 6.3 x 4.2 x 3.0 cm ulcerated tumor overlies the body of the mandible The
mucosal margins range ,from 0.3 cm to 2.0 CM. The anterior lateral and
posterior medial margins appear to comes to closest to the tumor and the tumor
is firm, tan, and focally necrotic and appears grossly to involve the cortical
bone. The tumor extends into the adjacent subcutaneous and dermal tissue of
the skin. Matted lymph nodesare present near the angle of the mandible.
These are grossly involved by partially necrotic tumor. A section of bone
will be submitted after decalcification.

"," Based on the pathology report, the following categories can be identified:

Site: The tumor is located in the hard palate and maxillary sinus, which are part of the upper aerodigestive tract.

Laterality: The tumor is present on the right side of the maxilla.

Histology: The tumor is a squamous cell carcinoma, which is a type of malignant epithelial tumor.

Stage: The tumor is at stage T4a N0 M0, indicating that it has grown into the surrounding tissues but has not yet spread to nearby lymph nodes or distant sites.

Grade: The grade of the tumor is not provided in the report.

Behavior: The behavior of the tumor is malignant, meaning that it is capable of invading and destroying surrounding tissues and spreading to other parts of the body.

Not provided: The information on the tumor's size, margins, lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion, or status of resection is not provided in the report.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Diagnosis:
Left neck tumor, paraganglioma
Discussion:
The tumor cells demonstrate diffuse strong immunoreactivity for synaptophysin and
chromogranin. S-100 highlights nerve fascicles and sustentacular cells. The histologic
features, in conjunction with the immunohistochemical findings, are consistent with a
paraganglioma.
Microscopic Description:
Microscopic examination reveals a paraganglioma . The tumor is characterized by nests
and small lobules of neoplastic cells with neuroendocrine features. The tumor cells
demonstrate round to oval nuclei with speckled chromatin and a moderate amount of
weakly eosinophilic cytoplasm. Overall, cytologic atypia appears mild. Only a rare
mitotic figure is seen. The nests of tumor are invested by hyalinized stroma. The
specimen includes a large ganglion with accompanying nerve fascicles. The tumor lies
adjacent to a network of vascular structures. Necrosis is not identified. The histologic
features appear most consistent with a paraganglioma.

Summary of sections: 3AFSC, 1/1.                4) SOURCE: Right Hypopharynx            The specimen labeled ""right hypopharynx,"" is received fresh and is      comprised of two pieces of tissue, one measuring 1.8 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm, the        second measuring 1.4 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm. The first piece of tissue does not have an easily identifiable mucosal surface. The second strip of tissue does have an identifiable mucosal surface. Each of these pieces of tissue       are inked blue, and the specimen is submitted entirely for frozen section.      Summary of sections: 4AFSC, entirely submitted, 2/1.            5) SOURCE: Pharyngolaryngectomy         The specimen labeled ""pharyngolaryngectomy"" is received fresh and is    comprised of a laryngectomy with attached epiglottis, thyroid cartilage with extension of the mucosa and trachea inferior to the thyroid cartilage.     The thyroid gland is not present with the specimen. The specimen measures       8.0 cm superior to inferior x 5.0 cm left to right x 4.8 cm anterior to posterior. The specimen has been opened prior to receipt along the      posterior aspect. The specimen is inked as follows: anterior-orange,    posterior-black, superior-yellow, inferior-green, right-red, left-blue. Examination of the specimen shows a 2.3 x 1.8 cm ulcerated lesion on the        posterior face of the epiglottis present centrally, extending to the left       and right (more prominently leftward), and towards the epiglottic vocal folds. The right and left superior vocal folds are involved, medially, with     the left involved laterally. The anterior commissure is involved. On    sectioning, the lesion penetrates 0.4 cm deep from the mucosal surface. There is a prominent 0.8 x 0.7 x 0.7 cm nodule in the left anterior     
 superior portion of the specimen abutting the anterior superior margin. 
There is no gross tumor involvement of the thyroid cartilage. The tumor

COLLECTED: RECEIVED: ///7-//3 9fJ
GROSS DESCRIPTION: A) Received in formalin designated right tonsil is an irregular,
unoriented, 2.5 x 2 x up to 1.4 cm in thickness partially mucosa covered portion of multinodular
tan white focally firm soft tissue. One side of the specimen is white-tan, somewhat granular and
firm. It is probably covered by mucosa. The specimen is serially sectioned perpendicular to the
mucosal surface. On cut surface there is an ill-defined, pale tan-white, firm nodule 1.5 x 1.2 x 1.5
cm in greatest dimension. It grossly approaches the deep, inked margin. The specimen is entirely
submitted in cassettes Al-A3. B) Received unfixed designated right modified radical neck
dissection, double long = level II, double short = level IV is an 18 x 8 x 3 cm in greatest
dimensions right neck dissection specimen with surgical sutures designating levels II and IV.
The specimen is multinodular with multiple grossly positive lymph nodes in levels II and III
including a complex of matted nodes that involves both levels; one node is received cut across. A
10 x 3 x 1.5 cm portion of sternocleidomastoid muscle is identified on the anterior aspect of the
specimen. On the medial aspect of the muscle there is a suture-tied on both ends, 7 cm long x 0.5
cm in outer diameter vessel (internal jugular vein). Additional portion of a vessel 3 cm long is
present in level I lateral to the salivary gland tissue. The salivary gland in level I measures 5 x 3
x 1 cm and has a smooth tan-pink, lobulated, soft cut surface. The skeletal muscle adjacent to
grossly positive lymph nodes in the middle of the specimen, is not involved. The main complex
of positive nodes measures 7 cm in greatest dimension and as previously described crosses both
levels II and III. Cassette index: B 1 - representative section of salivary gland; B2 - level I four
probable nodes; B3 - level I one node bisected; B4 - level I one node bisected; B5 - level II
section of grossly positive node (2 cm) and three probable nodes; B6 - level II three nodes; B7 -
level II one probable node; B8 - representative cross section of matted nodes; B9 - level III
representative section of grossly involved necrotic node (2.2 cm); B 10 - level III three nodes;
B 11 - level III three probable nodes; B 12 - level III one node bisected; B 13 - level IV two nodes
one inked blue and bisected; B 14 - three probable nodes, level IV; B 15 - level IV three probable
nodes.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
A) Tonsil ,right, tonsillectomy: Moderately to poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, at
least 2 .2cm in greatest dimension (slide A2 ),extending to inked margin.
B) Lymph nodes ,right neck ,radical dissection:
1.Level I i. Submandibular gland with no evidence of metastatic carcinoma .ii.Six lymph nodes
with no evidence of metastatic carcinoma (0/6).
2. Levels II-III i. Matted lymph nodes positive for metastatic carcinoma spanning both levels. ii.
One (2cm )of eight level II nodes positive for metastatic (1/8). iii .One (2 .2cm) of eight level III
nodes positive for metastatic carcinoma (1/8).
3. Level IV i. Eight llymph nodes with no evidence of metastatic carcinoma (0/8).

GROSS DESCRIPTION: 
The specimen is received in three parts. Part 1 is labeled with the patient' s name, initials xx, medical record 
number, and ""total laryngectomy and bilateral neck dissection"" and 
consists of 
a total laryngectomy with three tracheal rings and epiglottis, attached 
right selective neck dissection and left modified radical neck dissection, 
hyoid 
bone, and left thyroid lobe.  
In the left side of the larynx there is a 5.0 x 4.0 x 2.0 cm firm grey 
ulcerated mass, involving left glottis and extending superiorly to paraglottic 
space, invading left thyroid cartilage, and penetrating cricothyroidal 
membrane with extension into anterior strap muscles.  The tumor is 
within 5.0 
mm from left anterior soft tissue margin and 0.3 cm from left pyriform sinus.  
Left thyroid lobe appears to be unremarkable.  See Part 3 for left pyriform 
mucosal margin. The tumor is far away from right anterior soft tissue 
margins, and superior (base of tongue) margin. Purulent exudate is identified in 
right 
glottis.  
Left neck dissection consists of 12.0 x 10.0 x 6.0 cm segment of soft tissue with attached external jugular vein (6.0 cm long, 3.0 cm in open 
circumference 
in inferior segment and 0.6 cm in open circumference in superior 
segment), and 
7.0 cm in largest dimension, multicystic mass with necrotic yellow, granular 
material.   
Right neck dissection consists of a 9.0 x 2.3 x 1.0 cm segment of soft 
tissue, 
containing levels 2 through 4.   Representative sections of the metastatic and primary tumor are banked.  
Digital images are taken.

Review^'t !all"," Site: The samples were taken from various sites including the right anterior tonsillar pillar, retromolar trigone, right floor of mouth, ventral tongue, deep margin base of tongue, deep margin anterior, deep margin-deep tongue, level V lymph node, distal right hypoglossal, and submental triangle. Justification: The site is where the sample was taken, which is crucial in determining the origin and extent of the disease.

Laterality: Most of the samples were from the right side of the mouth and neck, with the exception of the level V lymph node and submental triangle, which are midline structures. Justification: Laterality is important in identifying any asymmetry or abnormalities that may suggest pathology.

Histology: The samples were described as red-tan tissue, with one sample of fatty tissue. However, the specific histologic diagnosis is not provided in this report. Justification: Histology is the study of the microscopic structure of tissues, which can reveal the type and nature of the disease present.

Stage: The stage of the disease is not provided in this report. Justification: Staging is a way to describe the extent of the disease, which is important in determining the prognosis and treatment plan.

Grade: The grade of the disease is not provided in this report. Justification: Grading is a way to describe the aggressiveness of the disease based on its microscopic features, which can help predict its behavior and response to treatment.

Behavior: The behavior of the disease is not provided in this report. Justification: The behavior of the disease refers to whether it is likely to grow and spread over time, which is important in determining the prognosis and treatment plan.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CASE: RECEIVED:
CLINICAL DATA: SCC of left mandibular mucosa. eyo?-/q// 5GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A)Received fresh designated ""..., left composite resection"" is a 4 AP x 2.5
ML x 2 SI cm portion of tissue that has been oriented by the surgeon with a
single stitch designated anterior and a double stitch designated lingual.
The lateral aspect of the specimen has bone. The specimen is covered by tan,
glistening mucosa with a central 2.5 x 1.5 cm ulcerated, ragged area. The
center of the lesion has been inked and tissue has been removed for research
studies. The lesion appears to be located approximately 0.5 cm from the
anterior margin and >0.5 cm from the posterior margin. The specimen is inked
as follows: Anterior - red; posterior - orange; mucosal and bony lateral
margin - green; bony and soft tissue deep margins - black; lingual/medial -
blue. The specimen is serially sectioned and the mass does not appear to
involve the red inked margin and it is located 0.3 cm from the orange margin.
The tumor appears to abut the blue inked and black inked margins and appears
to extend close to the bony green margin. Bone sections are decalcified.
80% of the specimen is submitted as follows: Al - mass, blue and black inked
margins; A2 - mass, orange, blue, and black inked margins; A3 - orange, blue,
and black inked margins and red inked margin; A4 - blue inked margins; A5 -
orange inked margin; A6 - blue inked margin; remaining sections submitted
following decalcification:A6- margins, green and orange; A7- orange inked
margin; A8-A9 green inked margin; A10- red inked margin.

INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION:
BFS-FFS) All margins negative for neoplasia
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
A)Left composite resection: Invasive squamous cell carcinoma, moderately
differentiated, with the following features:
1.2.5 cm in greatest dimension.
2.Carcinoma abuts (<0.1 cm) deep margin and it is located 0.1 cm from
lingual/medial submucosal margin, 0.2 cm from posterior submucosal margin,
0.3 cm from lateral mucosal and submucosal margins, and 0.6 cm from anterior
mucosal and submucosal margins; mucosal and bone margins are free of
carcinoma (please see separately submitted margins).
3.Carcinoma focally invades mandibular bone and involves underlying
salivary gland tissue.
4.Perineural invasion of small nerves is identified.
5.Minimum pathological stage pT4a NO MX(AJCC 6th ed; 2002).
B-D) Separately submitted margins, anterior, lateral and posterior, biopsies:
No carcinoma identified.
E,F)Separately submitted margins, medial and deep, biopsies: No carcinoma
identified.
G)Left neck contents, dissection:
1.29 lymph nodes with no carcinoma identified (0/29).
2.Salivary gland with fatty change; no carcinoma identified.
H)""Level I lymph node,"" dissection: Mature adipose tissue with no carcinoma
identified; no lymphoid tissue identified.
Procedures used to establish the diagnosis:
Routine"," Site: Left composite resection, left neck contents, level I lymph node
Laterality: Left
Histology: Invasive squamous cell carcinoma, moderately differentiated
Stage: Minimum pathological stage pT4a NO MX (AJCC 6th ed; 2002)
Grade: Not provided (typically not graded for squamous cell carcinoma)
Behavior: Malignant

Justification: The diagnosis is based on the description and measurements provided in section A, which describe a moderately differentiated invasive squamous cell carcinoma.

P^in,ar"," Site: The specimen is taken from the right tongue floor of the mouth.

Laterality: The tumor is located on the right side.

Histology: The specimen shows invasive squamous cell carcinoma.

Stage: The stage of the cancer is not provided, but it is reported that the depth of invasion is 0.55 cm.

Grade: The grade of the tumor is not provided in the report.

Behavior: Based on the histology and the fact that the tumor is invasive, the behavior of this lesion is likely to be malignant.

The reason for not providing the stage and grade is because they are not mentioned in the pathology report. The stage and grade of a cancer can provide important information about the extent of the disease and its prognosis, respectively. However, based on the information provided, it is clear that this is a significant finding of an invasive squamous cell carcinoma.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

^eviev. er Initials"," Site: Left buccal mucosa, posterior left mastoid tuberosity, and multiple neck dissections (Levels II, III, IV)
Justification: The clinical history mentions squamous cell carcinoma in the left buccal mucosa. Part B of the pathology report also confirms the presence of squamous mucosa in the posterior left mastoid tuberosity. Lastly, multiple neck dissections are mentioned across various parts of the report.

Laterality: Left
Justification: The clinical history and all relevant parts of the pathology report consistently mention the laterality as left.

Histology: Squamous cell carcinoma
Justification: The clinical history and part B of the pathology report both confirm the diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma in the left buccal mucosa and posterior left mastoid tuberosity.

Stage: Not provided
Justification: Although there are measurements of various specimens, the necessary information to determine the stage (such as tumor size, lymph node involvement, and distant metastasis) is not available in this report.

Grade: Not provided
Justification: The pathology report does not include any information about the grade of the squamous cell carcinoma.

Behavior: Malignant
Justification: Squamous cell carcinoma is a malignant tumor by nature, and this is further supported by the clinical history and pathology report.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

mucosa soft tissue fragment. The specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section consultation
and is resubmitted as B 1 C 1 FS. D) Received fresh for frozen section consultation labeled "" "" and
designated ""posterior margin"" is a 0.4 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm tan-pink mucosa soft tissue fragment. The
specimen is inked blue and entirely submitted for frozen section consultation, and is resubmitted
as A 1 D 1 FS. E) Received fresh for frozen section consultation labeled "" "" and designated
""medial margin"" is a 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.1 cm tan-pink mucosa soft tissue fragment. The specimen is
entirely submitted for frozen section consultation and is resubmitted as E 1 FS (?). F) Received
fresh, labeled ""maxilla, right"", is a right composite resection specimen comprising posterior
maxilla-and palatal resection. The specimen is 6.7 cm from anterior to posterior, 4.3 cm from
medial to lateral, and 3.5 cm from superior to inferior. The anterior mucosal surface has two
teeth with silver metal fillings; one is 0.8 cm in greatest dimension, and the other is 1.3 cm in
greatest dimension. A 2.7 x 1.4 cm depressed, indurated lesion is immediately posterior to the
teeth. The lesion has a central 2.2 x 0.6 cm defect consistent with excision of tumor for research.
The edge of the lesion is tan-white, dusky, and edematous, and it has a rolled edge. The lesion
extends 0.3 cm from the nearest lateral mucosal margin, 0.5 cm from the nearest posterior
mucosal margin, and 1.1 cm from the nearest medial mucosal margin. The anterior mucosal
margin is 1.8 cm from the lesion. The remainder of the mucosal surface is tan-pink, smooth and
glistening. The underlying soft tissue margins consist of tan-yellow, lobulated adipose tissue and
maroon-brown possible muscle. No definite tumor is identified at the soft tissue surface. The
medial- superior aspect of the specimen has a 3.3 x 1.0 cm mucosal surface consistent with sinus
cavity; the sinus mucosa is tan-pink, smooth and glistening with areas that are red-brown,
roughened, and focally hemorrhagic. The specimen is inked as follows: anterior = red, medial
anterior = black, medial posterior = green, superior = yellow, lateral = orange and posterior =
blue. The specimen is serially sectioned from anterior to posterior to reveal a 5.2 x 4.1 x 3.5 cm,
tan-white, poly-lobulated, firm mass which immediately underlies the previously described
mucosal lesion. The mass appears to abut the posterior, superior, lateral, and medial soft tissue
margins. The mass abuts the posterior aspect of the most posterior tooth, and it does not appear
to extend any farther anteriorly. Representative sections are submitted as follows: Ft - medial
sinus soft tissue margin; F2, F3 - posterior soft tissue margins, perpendicular; F4-F6 - composite
cross section of mid posterior plane of the specimen; F7 - anterior bone margin, en face (decal);
F8-F 10 - composite cross section of mid anterior plane of the specimen (decal). G) Received
fresh for frozen section consultation labeled "" new deep margin"" is a 0.8 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm red-
brown soft tissue fragment. The specimen was entirely submitted for frozen section consultation
and is resubmitted as G 1 FS. H) Designated ""Right maxilla tumor and all first 5 margins and
normal tongue tissue to research"": No tissue received. Tissue submitted for research in OR per designation on pathology requisition form received in pathology, not examined in Pathology. I)
Received unfixed labeled "" new deep margin #2"" is 0.7 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm tan-white to maroon-
brown soft tissue fragment entirely submitted as 11. J) Received unfixed labeled "" level I, II, III
nodes"" is an 11.2 x 5 x 2.5 cm tan-pink fibrofatty soft tissue segment. Specimen is oriented as
follows: one suture level I, two sutures level II, and three sutures level III. Multiple lymph node
candidates are identified in each level. Level I contains a grossly positive 2.6 x 1.7 x 2.3 cm tan-
white lymph node as well as a 3.7 x 2.6 x 1.4 cm fragment of tan-white, lobulated tissue
consistent with possible salivary gland. Level II contains two grossly positive lymph nodes, the
larger is 3.7 x 2.3 x 2.2 cm and the smaller is 2.2 x 1.4 x 0.9 cm. No grossly positive lymph
nodes are identified within level III. Representative sections are submitted as follows: J 1 -
representative section of grossly positive level I lymph node; J2 - one candidate lymph node
bisected; J3 - four intact candidate lymph nodes (J 1-J3 are level I); J4 - representative section of
level I possible salivary gland tissue; J5, J6 - cross-section of larger grossly involved level II
lymph node; J7 - representative cross-section of smaller grossly involved level II lymph node; J8
- one level II candidate lymph node bisected; J9 - four intact level II candidate lymph nodes; J 10
- three level III intact candidate lymph nodes. K) Received in formalin labeled "" level V lymph
nodes"" is a 3.2 x 1.9 x 1.8 cm tan-pink fibrofatty soft tissue segment. Multiple candidate lymph
nodes ranging from 0.3 to 1.2 cm are identified. Representative sections are submitted as
follows: K1 - six intact candidate lymph nodes; K2 - six intact candidate lymph nodes; K3 - two
candidate lymph nodes, one intact uninked and one bisected and inked black; K4 - three intact
candidate lymph nodes. L) Received in formalin labeled "" level IV lymph nodes"" is a 2.2 x 2 x
0.6 cm tan-yellow, fibrofatty soft tissue segment. Multiple tan-pink, otherwise unremarkable
lymph node candidates are identified. No gross metastases are identified. Representative sections
are submitted as follows: L 1 - two intact candidate lymph nodes; L2 - four intact candidate
lymph nodes.

1. The specimen is labeled with the patient's name and NCK: Contents right neck, left neck, mandibulectomy, intraoral 
resection right floor of mouth"". It consists of a segment of mandible, with attached floor of mouth and bilateral neck 
dissections with overall measurements of 11.0 cm AP x 22.5 SI x 10.0 ML cm. The portion of right mandible measures 
6.0 cm AP x 2.5 cm SI x 3.0 cm ML. The lower alveolar ridge is edentulous. There is a tumor arising in the alveolar ridge. 
The tumor measures 5.5 AP x 7.0 SI x 4.7 ML cm. The tumor appears ulcerated and involves mandibular bone, floor of 
mouth and the adjacent right neck dissection, where it forms a large, partially necrotic mass, substantially replacing the 
right level I with extension into level II. The tumor involves the right parotid and right submandibular glands. The tumor is 
located at 0.1 cm from the closest right lateral soft tissue margin. The distance from the remaining margins to the tumor 
are as follows: anterior alveolar mucosa 1.0 cm, posterior alveolar mucosa 1.8 cm, right lateral alveolar mucosa 0.4 cm, 
anterior floor of mouth mucosa 0.8 cm, posterior floor of mouth mucosa 0.5 cm, medial floor of mouth mucosa 0.6 cm,

Page 4 of 4 "," Site: The specimens are from various locations, including the left lateral floor of mouth, right posterior tongue base, near total glossectomy, bilateral neck dissection, right and left submandibular glands, right and left level I-IV lymph nodes, right penfacial node, and surgical waste. The justification for this category is to describe the origin of each specimen.

Laterality: The laterality is provided for some of the specimens, indicating whether they are from the right, left, or bilateral locations. This information is important for determining the side of the body affected by the disease process.

Histology: The histology, or tissue type, is not explicitly provided in the descriptions. However, the use of terms such as ""tumor,"" ""lymph nodes,"" and ""submandibular gland"" suggest different histologic types. This information is crucial for making a definitive diagnosis.

Stage: The stage of the disease is not provided in the descriptions. Staging is a critical component of cancer diagnosis, as it helps determine the extent of the disease and appropriate treatment options.

Grade: Similarly, the grade of the tumors is not provided in the descriptions. Tumor grade refers to how abnormal the cells appear and how quickly they are likely to grow and spread. This information is essential for determining the aggressiveness of the tumor and developing an effective treatment plan.

Behavior: The behavior of the disease is not explicitly provided in the descriptions. However, the use of terms such as ""tumor"" and ""malignancy"" suggests that some of the specimens are from malignant neoplasms with the potential to invade surrounding tissues and metastasize.

Not provided: The following information is not provided in the descriptions:

* Some laterality information is missing for certain specimens.
* Histology, stage, and grade information are not provided for any of the specimens.
* Behavior information is not explicitly stated but can be inferred from some of the descriptions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I a 
Pa!je a of a "," Site: The tumor site is in the larynx, specifically in the supraglottic region. This was determined by the specimen type being a total laryngectomy and the tumor site being described as ""larynx, supraglottic.""

Laterality: Not provided. The report does not mention if the tumor is on the left or right side of the larynx.

Histology: The histologic type is squamous cell carcinoma, conventional. This was determined by the description of the tumor and the histologic grade given as G2.

Stage: The pathologic staging (pTNM) is pT4a. This indicates that the tumor has grown into nearby tissues, such as the thyroid or tongue muscles, and/or into the larynx's outer covering.

Grade: The histologic grade is G2, which means the cancer cells are moderately differentiated from normal cells. This was determined by the description of the tumor and the histologic grade given as G2.

Behavior: The behavior of this tumor is malignant, meaning it invades nearby tissues and can spread to other parts of the body. This is inherent in the definition of cancer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

iewed;"," Based on the incomplete pathology form provided, I can give the following summary:

1. Site: The primary tumor location is not explicitly mentioned, but it seems to be a solid tumor involving an organ (possibly gastrointestinal or genitourinary based on some of the lab data).
2. Laterality: Not provided.
3. Histology: The histological type of the tumor is also not explicitly stated, but there are references to various cell types and patterns such as squamous, glandular, round cells, fibroblasts, and others.
4. Stage: Based on the available lab data and diagnostic studies, it appears that the tumor has metastasized (pT3 N1 M1 stage). However, this information is incomplete and should be confirmed with additional clinical and pathological data.
5. Grade: The grade of the tumor is not provided, but there are references to nuclear appearance, mitotic activity, and cellular differentiation which could be used to determine the grade if more specific information were available.
6. Behavior: Given the presence of metastasis, this tumor is behaving aggressively (malignant).

It's important to note that a definitive diagnosis cannot be made with the provided incomplete form, and additional clinical and pathological data would be necessary for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Colon,,Adenocarcinoma,T2N0Mx,II,Malignant,TCGA-DQ-7594.pdf,," Report: 
The surgical specimen shows a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma involving the mucosa and submucosa with no evidence of lymphovascular invasion. No regional lymph nodes were removed for examination.

1. ""Site"": Colon. Justification: The report mentions the surgical specimen, and colon adenocarcinoma is the most common type of cancer in this location.
2. ""Laterality"": Not provided. Justification: The report does not mention any laterality information as it refers to the colon without specifying left or right side.
3. ""Histology"": Adenocarcinoma. Justification: The report directly states a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma in the surgical specimen.

tongue"".
It consists of a 1.0 x 0.6 x 0.3 cm tan-red focally cauterized soft
tissue
evaluated intraoperatively. The remainder of frozen section tissue is
submitted labeled 5AFS.
Part 6 is labeled with the patient's name, initials XX and ""deep
margin"". It
consists of a 1.1 x 0.7 x 0.3 cm tan-pink cauterized soft tissue
evaluated
intraoperatively. The remainder of the frozen section tissue submitted
labeled 6AFS.
Part 7 is labeled with the patient's name, initials XX and ""right neck
dissection L 2-4"". It consists of an unoriented 14.0 x 5.0 x 1.3 cm
portion
of soft, yellow-pink, lobular, focally hemorrhagic and cauterized
fibroadipose
tissue. The specimen is arbitrarily divided into three equal portions
and on
dissection multiple ovoid and elongated, smooth, soft to moderately
firm, tan
to pink-red lymph nodes ranging 0.2 cm to 2.8 cm in greatest dimension
are
identified.
Section code:
7A- (1) bisected lymph node, one end of specimen
7B-C- intact lymph nodes from one end of specimen

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A)Received in formalin as right upper level 2 node is a 3.2 x 1.9 x 0.5
cm firm lobular piece of tan soft tissue. Sectioning reveals a mixed tan and
hemorrhagic parenchyma consistent with lymph node with one pole that has a
solid uniform white appearance. The specimen is sectioned and submitted
entirely in cassettes Al - A3.
B)Received in formalin as left lowest cervical node is a 0.7 cm greatest
dimension firm tan nodule surrounded by small amounts of fibrofatty tissue.
Sectioning reveals a uniformly tan parenchyma. The bisected specimen is
submitted entirely in cassette B1.
C)Received fresh as left neck dissection is an unoriented complex 10 x 8
x 3 cm specimen consisting of muscle and fibrofatty tissue and a large vein.
It is divided into levels 2 - 5. Anteriorly and immediately adjacent to a
major vein is a 7 x 4 x 3 cm white mass that is 80-90% necrotic grossly and
is present throughout levels 2 - 4. Very little of the mass appears viable.
It lies next to a major vein but does not appear to invade the lumen of the
vessel grossly. Multiple nodules are dissected from each level and submitted
entirely. Cassette summary: C1 - C4 - 7 cm necrotic mass with relation to
vessel - level 2; C5 - five level 2 nodules; C6 - three level 2 nodules; C7 -
three level 2 nodules; C8 - C9 - two level 3 nodules in each; C10 - four
level 4 nodules; Cll - two level 5 nodules; C12 - five level 5 nodules; C13 -
three level 5 nodules; C14 - five level 5 nodules.
D)Received fresh as left level 1 is a 4 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm aggregate of
tan/yellow soft tissue that has a minimally lobular appearance. It is
diffusely thick and firm. No definite lymph nodes are identified.
Representative sections are submitted in D1 - D5 (approximately 75%
submitted).
E)Received in formalin as proximal lingual nerve is a 0.5 cm irregular
shaped piece of tan-white tissue with a minimally exophytic appearance on one
surface. The entire specimen is submitted in cassette El.
F)Received in formalin as left sublingual gland is a 4.5 x 2 x 1 cm tan
lobular piece of soft tissue. Sectioning reveals approximately half the
specimen is composed of a lobular tan tissue consistent with salivary gland.
At one end is a 1.6 cm firm nodule composed of similar lobular tan tissue.
The entire specimen is submitted in Fl - F4.
G)Received fresh as left tonsil mass is an ovoid piece of red soft
tissue with a pink shiny mucosal surface measuring 4.6 x 3.5 x 2.2 cm
consistent with tonsil. At one pole the structure is a short stitch
designated inferior. Attached to this is a 4.5 x 3 x 0.5 cm triangular piece
of red soft tissue that appears to be skeletal muscle with a suture
designating medial pterygoid. The medial edge of the tonsil is inked blue
and lateral black. In the center of the mucosa is a 1.5 cm ovoid hole that
appears to contain a yellow-tan exophytic mass. Sectioning reveals a 4.5 x 3.5 x 2 cm mass grossly extending through the majority of the specimen. The
medial pterygoid muscle does not appear to be involved. Grossly the mass
extends to medial margin and is less than 0.1 cm from the lateral margin at
the inferior tip. The mass grossly approaches both lateral and medial
margins within 0.1 cm at the superior tip. The inferior and superior tips
are sectioned perpendicularly then into parallel sections.
Cassette summary: G1-G2 - inferior tip; G3-G4 - superior tip; G5-G8 -
complete cross sections from medial to lateral direction from inferior to
superior pole (one complete cross section in G6 -G7 and G8-G9); G10 -
representative skeletal muscle.
H)Received in formalin as left level 5 lymph node is a 3 x 2 x 1 cm
aggregate of fibrofatty tissue containing approximately nine nodules ranging
from 0.3 to 1.1 cm. Three nodules are submitted in each cassette: H1 - H3.
I)Received in formalin as left low level 4 node is a 2 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm
aggregate of tan fibrofatty tissue containing two nodules measuring 0.2 and
1.3 cm. The entire specimen is submitted in cassettes I1 - 12 (I1 one intact
and one bisected nodule).
J)Received in formalin as left facial node is a 1.2 cm greatest
dimension firm tan nodule that is submitted entirely in cassette J1.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
A)Lymph node (right upper level 2 node), biopsy: There is no evidence of
malignancy in one lymph node (0/1).
B)Lymph node (left lowest cervical node), biopsy: There is no evidence of
malignancy in one lymph node (0/1).
C)Lymph node (left neck) dissection:
Level II: Squamous cell carcinoma involving matted lymph nodes with
extensive extracapsular spread measuring 7 cm in greatest extent. Fifteen
additional
level II nodes with no evidence of malignancy.
Level III: No evidence of malignancy in four lymph nodes (0/4).
Level IV: No evidence of malignancy in six lymph nodes (0/6).
Level V: No evidence of malignancy in twelve lymph nodes (0/12).
D)Labeled left level 1 : Seromucinous salivary gland with no diagnostic
abnormality including no evidence of malignancy.
E)Labeled proximal lingual nerve : Peripheral nerve with no evidence of
malignancy.
F)Labeled left sublingual gland : Seromucinous salivary gland and
peripheral nerve with no diagnostic abnormality including no evidence of
malignancy.
G)Labeled left tonsil mass :
1.Squamous cell carcinoma, moderately to poorly differentiated, invasive
of tonsil and adjacent pharyngeal skeletal muscle.
2.Size: 4.5 x 3.5 x 2.0 cm

COMMENT:  
The specimen (part number) labeled as ""teeth"" has been subjected to a gross  
examination only.  If it is desired that this specimen be processed for  
additional studies, particularly microscopic examination, it is suggested that  
the case pathologist be notified within two weeks of the sign -out date of this  
report.  This is particularly important as specimens are routinely discarded  
after a prescribed period of time.                      
 material(s) and the final diagnosis reflects that evaluation.

"," Site: Oral Cavity
The location of the tumor from where the specimen was taken.

Laterality: Left
The side of the oral cavity where the tumor is located.

Histology: Squamous cell carcinoma, conventional
The type of cancer based on how the cells appear under a microscope.

Stage: pT4a, pN0, pMX
This represents the extent of the tumor and whether it has metastasized to nearby lymph nodes or distant sites. pT4a indicates a large tumor that invades deeply into the muscle or bone, pN0 means no regional lymph node involvement, and pMX indicates that distant metastasis was not evaluated in this case.

Grade: G3
The grade of the tumor describes how abnormal the cancer cells look under a microscope and suggests how quickly the tumor is likely to grow and spread. A high grade (G3) indicates that the cancer cells are fast growing and more likely to spread.

Behavior: Malignant
This category describes whether the tumor is benign or malignant. In this case, the behavior of the tumor is malignant, meaning it can invade nearby tissues and spread to other parts of the body.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Comment  
The specimen is received in two parts. There is a polypoid lesion, which is made up of spindled 
and epithelioid dyscohesive cells that show a high mitotic activity and pleomorphism, consistent with high- grade spindle cell neoplasm. Foci within this polyp also show typical squamous cell 
carcinoma. The second specimen is made up of a large area of squamous dysplasia with early invasive conventional squamous cell carcinoma, moderately differentiated. The conventional squamous cell carcinoma is seen within 0.3 cm of the lateral and deep margins. The sarcomatoid carcinoma component is largely confined to the exophytic polyp and is not seen near the margins. The tumor thickness of the early invasive component is 0.3 cm, however the total thickness taking into account the polypoid lesion is 1.5 cm.

1. The specimen is labeled with the patient's name and as "" Oral cavity: rt tongue lesion”. It 
consists of an unoriented piece of oval, tan, firm mass with smooth surface, measuring 2.8 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm. On cut surface, tumor is tan white and homogenous. There is a pedicle measuring 0.5 x 0.5 cm. Specimen was cut by for tumor bank and not painted.  
Specimen is submitted in toto in blocks 1A through 1E.  
 2. The specimen is labeled with the patient's name and as ""Rt glossectomy (stitch=anterior)"".  It consists of a portion of tongue measuring 4.6 x 3.2 x 2.3 cm.   There is a stitch on the anterior margin.  There is a tumor involving the lateral surface of the tongue. It is grey white in colour, 
hard in consistency, and has a dull surface. There is a small ulcerated area (? area of pedicle) , 
which is 0.4 cm away from anterior margin and measures 0.5 x 0.5cm. The tumor measures 3.2 
(AP) x 2.0 cm (SI) x 0.3 cm (ML/ deep).  The tumor is 0.3 cm away from superior, 0.5 cm away from inferior, 0.4 cm away from anterior, 1.0 cm away from posterior, and 1.5 cm away from medial margin. Specimen is painted with silver nitrate and marked with green ink on supero-medial aspect.  Representative sections are submitted.

"," Based on the pathology report, here is the information for each category:

1. Site: The report does not provide a specific site, only mentioning different levels of neck dissections and right and left sides. However, there are references to the base of tongue, submandibular gland, and parotid gland, so we can infer that the site is related to one or more of these areas.
2. Laterality: The report mentions both left and right neck dissections, indicating that the procedure was performed on both sides.
3. Histology: The report does not provide a specific histological diagnosis, only mentioning the absence of tumor in some sections. However, there are references to adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, lymph nodes, and salivary glands, which suggest a possible diagnosis of a benign or malignant neoplasm of one of these tissues.
4. Stage: The report does not provide information about the stage of the disease.
5. Grade: The report does not provide information about the grade of the tumor.
6. Behavior: Based on the mention of ""neoplasm"" and ""mass"" in the report, we can assume that the behavior is related to a neoplastic process, which could be benign or malignant.

Justification for the choices: The information was extracted from the pathology report, which contains various sections describing the findings of different levels of neck dissections and other related procedures. Although some specific details are missing, there is enough information to make educated guesses about the site, laterality, histology, stage, grade, and behavior of the disease.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

previously inked and incised portion of left tongue, which has dimensions of 5.6
x 4.9 x 2 .3 cm. The specimen was initially received fresh with tissue submitted
to the Tissue Bank .The deep surface is irregular, gray -brown and focally
cauterized .The mucosa is gray-tan and diffusely granular .The lateral border of
the tongue is remarkable for an ulceration ,which has dimensions of 1.8 x 1.2
cm. This ulceration extends to within 0 .2 cm of the nearest inferior lateral
mucosal edge .The specimen is further sectioned to reveal a gray -white, granular
indurated mass ,which has dimensions of 3.6 x 2.2 x 1.3 cm. This mass is
contiguous with the aforementioned ulceration .This mass extends to the soft
tissue edge at numerous sites. There is some loosely attached soft tissue at the
inferior lateral aspect of the specimen ,which has dimensions of 3.0 x 2.6 x 0.8
cm. This tissue is sectioned to reveal a gray-tan, lobulated cut surface that is
grossly suggestive of salivary gland. Also, the soft tissue is remarkable for
focal granularity ,fibrosis and induration .These foci are highly suspicious.
Representative sections are submitted as labeled:
N1-4 mass to include ulceration and close mucosal edges in cassettes N1

The sample consists of a 45-year-old male patient with a left supraclavicular lymph node excision. The lymph node measured 2.8 cm in greatest dimension and showed complete replacement by a metastatic carcinoma. The tumor cells were arranged in sheets and nests, with focal cribriform architecture. Immunohistochemical stains for keratin AE1/AE3 were positive, confirming the epithelial nature of the neoplasm. The primary site was not identified.

1. Site: not provided, as the primary site was not identified in the report.
2. Laterality: left, as the lymph node excision was from the left supraclavicular region.
3. Histology: metastatic carcinoma, as the report mentioned the presence of a metastatic carcinoma in the lymph node.
4. Stage: not provided, as there is no information about the TNM stage in the report.
5. Grade: not provided, as there is no information about the differentiation or grade of the tumor cells in the report.
6. Behavior: malignant, as metastatic carcinoma implies spread to other sites and thus malignant behavior.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tumor description: firm, gray/white, ill-defined/infiltrative
with a smooth cut surface and superficially ulcerated
Location of tumor: floor of mouth/sublingual
Extent of tumor: tumor extends the anterior mandible and into
the subcutaneous tissue, 0.5 cm from the skin surface; the mass
extends into the left mandible by 0.4 cm, and into the right
mandible by 0.6 cm, the mass extends into the tongue occupying
approximately 30% of the tongue
Presence/absence of bone involvement: Present, extends into the
left mandible, into the right mandible, and through the anterior
mandible

nearest skin margins which is 12 and 6 o' clock, left
mandibular bone margin 2.7 cm, right mandibular bone margin 2.8
cm, the right posterior lateral soft tissue margin 0.1 cm, the
left posterior lateral soft tissue margin 0.3 cm, left lateral
mucosal margin/soft tissue margin 1.0 cm, right lateral
mucosal/soft tissue margin 0.3 cm, and inferior soft tissue
margin 0.4 cm
Description of remainder of tissue: The left submandibular gland
is tan and lobulated with one partly necrotic/cavitary firm
white parasubmandibular lymph node (4.0 x 2.8 x 1.5 cm) that
grossly abuts the inferior soft tissue margin. The left
submandibular gland is free of mass and is grossly abutted by
the positive lymph node. The mass is 2.5 cm from the
submandibular gland but extends into a 2.7 x 1.7 x 1.0 cm
separate glandular structure consistent with left sublingual
gland. The right submandibular gland is tan and lobulated,
uninvolved by mass (mass is 2.5 cm from the gland). Within the
soft tissue adjacent to the right submandibular gland are two
firm smooth gray/white lymph nodes, up to 2.0 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm in
greatest dimension. These lymph nodes grossly abut the inferior
margin. The mass extends into a 2.5 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm right
sublingual gland. Along the gingiva are diffusely discolored
brown/gray (approximately 7) chipped/jagged teeth.

Gross Description: 
Received are six appropriately labeled containers. 
Container A: 
Specimen fixation: formalin 
Type of specimen: total glossectomy with neck dissection 
Size of specimen: The specimen consists of a composite 
resection consisting of right mandible (8.5 x 3.5 x 0.9 em) 
and the entire tongue (14.0 x 6.0 x 3.0 em). Attached to 
the inferior aspect of the mandible is a pedicle of 
yellow/tan soft tissue that measures 6.5 x 2.0 x 0.8 em. 
Orientation of specimen: The specimen is not oriented. The 
margins are inked as follows: anterior/green, 
posterior/blue, lateral/orange, inferior/yellow, deep/black 
Tumor description: grayish/white, ulcerative lesion 
Location of tumor: The tumor is situated at the tongue 
root, right floor of the mouth, and right tonsillar fossa. 
Tumor size: 6.0 x 2.5 x 1.5 em 
Extent of tumor: The tumor extends along the entire right 
lateral mucosal surface to grossly involve the anterior 
soft tissue margin of resection. On cut section, the tumor 
extends into the vertical muscle of the tongue to a depth 
of 1.3 em. 
Presence/absence of bone involvement: The tumor abuts the 
submandibular fossa, does not grossly appear to be invading 
into the bone. 
Distance of tumor from surgical margins: The tumor grossly 
involves the anterior soft tissue margin of resection. 
Description of remainder of tissue: Embedded within the 
soft tissue pedicle, extending from the inferior aspect of  the mandible, are seven apparent tan/brown lymph nodes that 
measure up to 0.4 em. In addition, the inferior aspect of 
the mandible has what appears to be a segment of possible 
submandibular gland that measures 2.0 x 1.0 x 0.6 em; on 
cut section, two additional apparent lymph nodes are 
identified that measure up to 0.4 em. Elsewhere, the soft 
tissues are unremarkable.

  Gross Description:  
Received are twenty specimen containers all labeled with the patient's name.  
Parts D through part R are all received fresh for frozen  
section evaluation with parts A through C, S and T received in formalin.    
 Part A is received additionally labeled ""right level 1B and level 1A"" and  
consists of a single portion of pink -tan to yellow soft tissue consisting of an  
apparent salivary gland, which is 4 x 3.2 x 1.3 cm with an additional attached  
fibrofatty tissue, which are 3 x 2 x 1.1 cm.   Step sectioning the salivary gland  
component reveals the usual tan lobulated architecture without distinct mass.  There are no intraparenchymal lymph nodes grossly identified.   Representative  
section of the salivary gland is submitted in cassette A1.   Within the  
associated fibrofatty tissues there are four probable lymph nodes, which range  
from 0.2 to 1.3 cm in greatest dimension, none of which appear involved by  
 tumor, which are submitted as follows:  
     A2      one whole probabl e lymph node;  
     A3      three whole probable lymph nodes.  
 
Part B is received additionally labeled ""rightperifacial lymph node"" and  
consists of a single portion of pink -tan nodular and yellow lobulated soft  
tissue, all of which have aggregate dimensions of 2 x 1.4 x 0.8 cm.   Examination  
of these tissues confirms the presence of two probable lymph nodes, 0.3 and 1.8  
cm in greatest dimension, neither of which appear to have tumor involvement.  
These lymph node candidates are submitted as follows:       B1      one whole probable lymph node;  
     B2      one whole probable lymph node bisected.  
 
Part C is received additionally labeled ""right mandible composite resection  
(margins taken from patient), single stitch margin right basilar tongue, double  
stitch ri ght anterior buccal.""   This composite specimen has aggregate dimensions  
of 9 x 6 x 5 cm and consists of a partial resection of mandible, having  
dimensions of 6 x 4.5 x 0.9 cm with associated adherent soft tissue, surfaced by  
mucosa to include right buccal wall region of trigone, floor of mouth and  
approaching base of tongue.   This soft tissue component has dimensions of 9 x  
4.5 by up to 2 cm (base of tongue).    
 
The cut surfaces of the soft tissue component are inked in the following manner:  
 Base of tongue black (region of single suture), perimandibular tissues and  
region approaching trigone pharyngeal wall blue.    
 The mucosa of the specimen is remarkable for an area of probable leukoplakia,  
3.5 x 2 cm with areas that are slightly raised up to 0.2 cm, superior/pharyngeal  
trigone region with an abutting separate nodular mass, which is 1.4 x 1.1 x 0.6  
cm, grossly consistent with possible fibroma.   Subjacent to the area of fibroma 
and leukoplakia, there is a separate confluent area of presumed invasive tumor,  
5.5 x 3.2 cm, which extends from the angle of the mandible/right buccal wall  
(area of double tailed suture) confluent to the base of tongue region (see gross  
photo).   The area of leukoplakia approaches the posterior cut surface to within  
0.4 cm, probable i nvasive mass approaches anterior cut surface of soft  
tissue/mandible to within 0.5 cm and posteriorly 0.6 cm, as well as base of  
tongue to within 0.4 cm.   The soft tissues are removed from the bony mandible  
component and there is gross evidence of tumor adherent to the surface of the  
bone at the angle of the mandible and subsequent sectioning through this area of  
adherent tumor reveals superficial involvement of cortical bone with no gross  
evidence of deep invasion, to be confirmed microscopically (cassettes C4 and C5).  Sectioning through the region previously described as probable  
leukoplakia, confirms superficial involvement of the mucosa and sectioning  
through the abutting adjacent possible fibroma confirms its tan- white  
homogeneous cut surface without hemorrhage or necrosis.   Sectioning through the 
primary mass reveals verrucoid change, as well as grossly invasive tumor to a  
depth of 0.7 cm, which correlates with the region previously abutting the  
mandible (see cassettes C9- 11).   Step sectioning through  the confluent tumor,  
which approaches base of tongue, reveals invasion to a depth of 0.4 cm and  approaches to within 0.7 cm of the deep cut surface base of tongue (see cassette 
C12 and C13).

Microscopic Description:  
Histologic examination reveals a right mandibular composite resection with right  
neck dissection. The composite resection is prominent for a mucosal squamous  
cell carcinoma demonstrating a papillary surface configuration with extensive  
keratinization. Invasion into the underlying connective tissue is seen in the  
form of sheets and islands. Moderate differentiation is noted in areas. This  
arises from an extensive z one of carcinoma in situ and dysplasia across the  
surface of the specimen. The carcinoma focally erodes the cortex of the mandible but does not invade the medullary component. The associated lymph node  
dissection fails to reveal the presence of metastatic disease.

Addendum Comment 
Decalcified sections of the mandible show invasion of alveolar bone by squamous 
;ell carcinoma. The bone margins are negative for tumor. Page 5 of5 
"," Site: The specimens are taken from various sites in the oral cavity, including posterior ventral tongue, retromolar trigone, posterior buccal mucosa, revision anterior floor of mouth, and right mandibulectomy with resection of the floor of the mouth. Justification: The site is explicitly mentioned for each specimen in the description.

Laterality: Most of the specimens do not provide information on laterality. However, one specimen is taken from the right side of the mandible. Justification: The laterality is provided only for the right mandibulectomy specimen.

Histology: The histology of the specimens includes squamous cell carcinoma, atypia, dysplasia, acanthosis, and parakeratosis. Justification: The histology is described for each specimen in the report.

Stage: The stage of the tumor is provided only for the right mandibulectomy specimen, which is a partial mandibulectomy with floor of mouth resection. Justification: The stage is not provided for most of the specimens.

Grade: The grade of the tumor is not provided in the report. Justification: The report does not mention the grade of the tumor.

Behavior: The behavior of the tumor is not provided in the report. However, the report mentions invasion of alveolar bone by squamous cell carcinoma in the decalcified sections of the mandible. Justification: The behavior is not provided for most of the specimens, but the invasion of alveolar bone indicates malignant behavior for the tumor in the mandible.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

/Q03 Cj DcL'7 I, the attending pathologist, personally reviewed the entire
case and rendered the final diagnosis. Electronically Signed Out by
Comment
Histologic sections of the tumor in the right show a high grade, spindle cell malignancy-
lmmunohistochemical stains, performed on blocks A4 and A5 with adequate controls, demonstrate the
tumor cells to be strongly and diffusely positive for vimentin and desmin, moderately positive for p16,
weakly positive for actin, and negative for AE11AE3, CAM5.2, CK5/6, p63, 5-100, CD34, calponin,
GD68, myoglobin, pan-melanoma, and smooth-muscle myosin. CD31s shows equiovocal staining.
These findings support the above diagnosis of a high-grade leiomyosarcoma. Dr. Af the
sarcoma service and Dr. have reviewed this case and concur.

Comment
Part F :Chronic granulomatous inflammation is noted in several lymph nodes (Part A , J) as well as in association with
the squamous cell carcinoma in the main specimen (Part N ).In retrospective review of the frozen section of Part F,
intraoperatively diagnosed as 'atypical focus cells surrounded by chronic inflammation - focus disappears on deeper
frozen sections', most likely represents a focus of granulomatous inflammation.

left breast,left,Invasive ductal carcinoma,,Grade III (High grade or poorly differentiated),Malignant,TCGA-CV-7235.pdf,    ," Report: 
The patient is a 64-year-old woman with a history of left breast mass. A core needle biopsy was performed. The specimen consists of two fragments of tan-pink tissue. The larger fragment measures 0.9 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm and the smaller fragment measures 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm. Microscopic description: The tumor is composed of cells arranged in cords and nests, with focal comedo necrosis. The tumor cells have high nucleus to cytoplasm ratio, vesicular chromatin, and conspicuous nucleoli. Mitotic figures are easily identified. Immunohistochemical stains show the tumor cells to be positive for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2 neu. The background shows extensive lymphocytic infiltration. No ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or invasive carcinoma is identified in the surrounding breast tissue.

1. ""Site"": left breast. Justification: The report mentions a left breast mass and the biopsy was performed on the left breast.
2. ""Laterality"": left. Justification: The tumor is located in the left breast, as stated in the report.
3. ""Histology"": Invasive ductal carcinoma. Justification: The report mentions the tumor cells are arranged in cords and nests with focal comedo necrosis, consistent with invasive ductal carcinoma.
4. ""Stage"": Not provided. Justification: The TNM stage cannot be determined from this report as it does not mention the size of the tumor, lymph node involvement, or metastasis.
5. ""Grade"": Grade III (High grade or poorly differentiated). Justification: The tumor cells have high nucleus to cytoplasm ratio, vesicular chromatin, and conspicuous nucleoli with easily identified mitotic figures, all of which are features of a high-grade tumor.

COMMENT 
The tumor measures 7.0 cm in maximum dimension. Its epicenter is 
in the region of the submandibular salivary gland beneath the skin overlying the mandible. Grossly it involves the mandible and extends from the buccal 
subcutaneous tissue medially to beneath the oral mucosa. The intervening soft tissue including the submandibular gland and skeletal muscle are 
involved by tumor. The tumor likely originates in the salivary gland and there is carcinoma in situ present in wharton's duct and there is no 
involvement of the epidermis or mucosa. Mucicarmine stains fail to 
demonstrate intracytoplasmic mucin. Sections of mandible will be reported in 
a supplemental report following decalcification. 
The nodule of squamous cell carcinoma in the subdigastric area measures 1.2 cm in maximum dimension and likely represents an obllterated lymph node. 
The largest lymph node metastasis completely replaces a lymph node measuring 
0.7 cm ln maximum dimension. Extranodal extension measuring 0.1 cm is

TC1"," Site: The tumor is located in the larynx, specifically in the supraglottic region, as well as extending to the pyriform sinus and base of tongue. This is based on the ""TUMOR LOCATION/SEGMENT"" and ""ATTACHED STRUCTURES"" information provided.

Laterality: The tumor is primarily located on the right side, with extension across the midline to the left side. This is determined by the ""TUMOR LATERALITY"" and ""TUMOR LOCATION/SEGMENT"" information given.

Histology: The tumor is a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. This is stated in the ""HISTOLOGIC TYPE OF TUMOR"" and ""HISTOLOGIC GRADE"" categories.

Stage: The tumor is at least stage pT2 pN2, as there is evidence of supraglottic involvement and metastasis to 128 left-sided lymph nodes. The M stage is not provided, so it cannot be definitively determined.

Grade: The tumor is moderately differentiated, as mentioned in the ""HISTOLOGIC GRADE"" category.

Behavior: The tumor is malignant, based on the diagnosis of cancer of the larynx and the histological findings of squamous cell carcinoma.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CLINICAL DATA: 41This is a -year-old man with a clinical history of left tonsil tumor.
Procedure is a left common TC resection with left radial F.F.
GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A)Received in formalin designated ""left neck dissection DL level III, DS
level II"" is a 9 cm x 2.8 cm x 1.5 cm yellow fibrofatty tissue with two long
sutures on one side designated as superior surface , and two short sutures
on one side designated as inferior portion . There are no apparent masses
identified. The specimen is separated in the mid portion. The superior
portion represents level II soft tissue, while the inferior portion
represents level III soft tissue. There are multiple lymph nodes identified.
Representative sections are submitted as follows: Al, A2 - level II lymph
nodes (Al- twelve (12) potential lymph nodes, A2- two (2) potential lymph
nodes), A3, A4 - level III lymph nodes (A3- thirteen (13) potential lymph
nodes and A4 - three (3) potential lymph nodes).
B)Received in formalin designated ""left level IA"" are two tissue irregular
soft yellow fatty tissue, measuring 2.0 x 1.0 x 0.9 cm and 1.0 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm
in greatest dimensions. There are four potential lymph nodes identified. All
are submitted in cassette B1.
C)Received fresh designated ""composite resection"" is an irregular piece of
soft tissue and bone, measuring 7.0 x 6.0 x 4.0 cm in greatest dimension. The
bone is grossly consistent with a portion mandible, including part of the
ramus and posterior part of the body. On the medial aspect of the bone,
there is a irregular soft tissue partially covered with pink mucosa. On the
anteroinferior aspect, a round lobule of normal appearing salivary gland is
seen. Located in the center, there is an irregular ulcer identified,
measuring 3.5 cm (anteroposterior plane) x 3 cm (superoinferior plane) x 1.3
cm (mediolateral plane). The ulcer extends to within 0.5 cm of the anterior
mucosal margin, 0.8 cm of the superolateral margin, 1.0 cm of the posterior
margin and 0.3 cm of the inferomedial resection margins. No apparent intact
tonsil is identified. The attached salivary gland measures 3 x 1.9 x 1.5 cm
in maximal dimension and appears grossly unremarkable. The soft tissue
margins are composed predominantly of irregular tissue including muscle and
connective tissue as well as occasional fat. The tumor is not identified on
the surgical margins.There appears to be a small hemorrhagic polyp that is
0.4 cm x 0.3 cm extending off of the posterolateral surface of the tonsil.
No other gross abnormalities are identified. The specimen is inked as
follows:Anterior soft tissue margin - blue, inferomedial soft tissue margin
- yellow, posterior soft tissue margin - black, and superolateral soft tissue
margin - orange. Serial sections of the specimen demonstrate grayish white,
firm tumor mass extending to within approximately 0.3 cm of the inferior (yellow) soft tissue margin, 0.7 cm from the superolateral (orange), and 0.1
cm of the anterior soft tissue margin.
Representative sections are submitted as follows: Cl, C2 - anterior
resection margin (perpendicular to the inked margin); C,3, C4 - one complete
cross section of the tumor (C3 is inferior to C4); C5, C6 - one complete
cross section of the tumor (posterior to C3 and C4; C5 is inferior to C6);
C7, C8 and Cli - posterior resection margin (perpendicular to the inked
margin; C7 is superior to C8); C9 - salivary gland; C10 - cross section of
the mandible (tissue submitted for decalcification).
D)Received in formalin designated ""left level III"" is one piece of fatty
tan-brown tissue measuring 1.2 x 1.2 x 1.3 cm. One potential lymph node is
identified, serially sectioned, and submitted entirely in D1.
E)Received in formalin designated ""level V node"" is a single tan and
yellow 1.7 x 1.3 x 0.9 cm piece of tissue. Five potential lymph nodes are
identified and are submitted in El.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
A)Lymph nodes, designated left neck dissection (level II and III),
excision: Metastatic carcinoma to one of 26 lymph nodes (1/11 level II lymph
nodes and 0/15 level III lymph nodes).
No evidence of extracapsular soft tissue extension.
B)Lymph nodes, designated left, level IA , excision: No evidence of
metastatic carcinoma in 4 lymph nodes (0/4).
C)Tonsillar bed, portion of mandible and salivary gland, left, composite
resection:
Invasive squamous cell carcinoma, with the following features:
1.Size: 3.5 cm in greatest dimension.
2.Moderately differentiated.
3.Carcinoma invades the underlying skeletal muscle, with very focal
invasion of minor salivary gland tissue; the submandibular salivary gland is
free of carcinoma.
4.Foci of angiolymphatic and perineural space invasion are identified.
5.The inked surgical margins are free of carcinoma. See comment. Invasive
carcinoma extends to within 0.1 cm of the anterior soft tissue resection
margin (C2), 0.1 cm of the cauterized inferomedial soft tissue resection
margin (C3),0.2 cm of the deep soft tissue resection margin (Cl), 0.4 cm of
the posterior soft tissue mucosal resection margin (Cll), and 0.9 cm of the
superolateral soft tissue resection margin (C6).
6.No gross bony invasion is identified; pending decalcification.
7.No gross involvement of bony margins is seen; pending decalcification.
8.See comment.
D)Soft tissue, designated left, level III , excision: Benign fibroadipose
tissue; no lymph nodes are identified.
E)Lymph nodes, designated level V , excision: No evidence of metastatic
carcinoma in 5 lymph nodes (0/5).
COMMENT: Carcinoma approximates inked margins in C7 and C8, however, on correlation
with gross appearance these foci are interpreted as tissue tear-distortion
with ink run-off and not as true inked margins.
The minimal pTNM classification is pT2, pNl, pMx (AJCC staging manual, 6th
edition, 2002). Assessment of bony invasion and bony margins is currently
pending (decalcification). The results will be reported as addendum.
Procedures used to establish the diagnosis:
Submit tissue for decalcification
ADDENDUM REASON:
This addendum is issued to report the histologic findings in the
decalcification specimens. Additional representative bony margins are
submitted in cassettes C12 and C13. The overall diagnosis remains unchanged.
ADDENDUM FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
A)Lymph nodes, designated left neck dissection (level II and III),
excision:
Metastatic carcinoma to one of 26 lymph nodes (1/11 level II lymph nodes and
0/15 level III lymph nodes).
No evidence of extracapsular soft tissue extension.
B)Lymph nodes, designated left, level IA , excision: No evidence of
metastatic carcinoma in 4 lymph nodes (0/4).
Tonsillar bed, portion of mandible and salivary gland, left, composite
resection:
Invasive squamous cell carcinoma, with the following features:
Size: 3.5 cm in greatest dimension.
Moderately differentiated.
Carcinoma invades the underlying skeletal muscle, with very focal invasion of
minor salivary gland tissue; the submandibular salivary gland is free of
carcinoma.
Foci of angiolymphatic and perineural space invasion are identified.
The inked surgical margins are free of carcinoma. See comment. Invasive
carcinoma extends to within 0.1 cm of the anterior soft tissue resection
margin(C2), 0.1 cm of the cauterized inferomedial soft tissue resection
margin (C3),0.2 cm of the deep soft tissue resection margin (Cl), 0.4 cm of
the posterior soft tissue mucosal resection margin (C11), and 0.9 cm of the
superolateral soft tissue resection margin (C6).
No bony invasion is identified.
Bone margins with cellular marrow exhibiting trilineage maturation; no
evidence of carcinoma.
D)Soft tissue, designated left, level III , excision: Benign fibroadipose
tissue; no lymph nodes are identified.
E)Lymph nodes, designated level V , excision: No evidence of metastatic
carcinoma in 5 lymph nodes (0/5).

MENT:  
For staging and synoptic reporting purposes, the soft tissue deposit in level  
2 of the left neck (part 6) is considered a positive lymph node with extensive  
extracapsular spread, though there is no actual residual lymph node  
architecture. Additionally, the vallecular margin is considered positive,  
albeit involved by a separate primary tumor.    
     Pathologist:       ** Report Electronically Signed Out **  
     By Pathologist:       My signature is attestation that I have personally reviewed the submitted  
material(s) and the final diagnosis reflects that evaluation.

Part 5 is labeled with the patient's name, initials, XX and labeled as ""left hypoglossal nerve"". It consists of four fragments of tissue measuring 1.0 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm in aggregate.  The specimen is totally submitted for frozen  
section consultation and resubmitted in cassette labeled 5AFS.  
Part 6 is labeled with the patient's name, initials, XX and labeled as ""left neck levels 2, 3, and 4"".  It consists of a 7.1 x 6.5 x 2.5 cm unoriented  
fibroadipose tissue.  The specimen is oriented based on the radiographic report and divided into levels 2, 3 and 4.  One large possible lymph node  
measuring 3.2 x 2.2 x 1.8 cm is identified on level 2 and serially sectioned,  
which reveals central necrosis.  The possible lymph node was banked for 
 tissue bank. Representative sections of the lymph node are submitted in  
cassettes 6A and 6B.  The remainder of the tissue reveals multiple lymph nodes  
ranging in greatest dimension fro m 0.1 to 1.4 cm.  Lymph nodes are submitted

specimen measuring 8.0 x 8.0 x 6.1 cm including 3 trachea rings, hyoid bone,  
left thyroid lobe (4.0 x 2.0 x 1.1 cm) and a possible parathyroid (2.2 x 0.9 x  
0.5 cm) that is attached to the left thyro id gland. Grossly, there is a 4.1 x  
3.2 x 1.7 cm, white -tan, firm, hypopharyngeal mass predominantly located in  
the left pyriform sinus space.  The mass has supraglottic extension involving  
the left false vocal fold.  Gross sectioning reveals that the tumo r does not  
involve thyroid cartilage, cricoid cartilage, preepiglottic soft tissue and  
anterior soft tissue. The tumor is approximately 2.5cm from the anterior soft  
tissue margin.  
The left thyroid lobe is serially sectioned and reveals a homogeneous, flesh y, 
red, unremarkable parenchyma. The tumor is banked for tissue bank.  
Digital images are taken.

""larynx and pharynx.""  The specimen is a laryngopharyngectomy specimen 
including a total laryngectomy (11.0 cm epiglottic tip to distal trachea, 6.0 
cm right to left and 7.0 cm anterior to posterior"" with attached 7.5 cm long 
segment of pharynx (6.5 cm maximum circumference), 9.0 cm long by 1.5 cm diameter hyoid bone, 5.5 x 3.5 x 1.5 cm thyroid gland with no identified 
parathyroid glands and a 3.5 cm long tracheostomy site surrounded by a 4.5 x 
3.5 cm piece of skin.  Five tracheal rings are present in the laryngectomy 
specimen. 
Centered in the right inferior pyriform sinus of the hypopharynx is a 7.0 cm 
long x 5.0 cm in circumference ulcerated tumor with white solid cut surface. 
The tumor is up to 2.3 cm in maximum depth with extension very close to the 
right superior piriform sinus soft tissue and 0.9 cm from distal esophageal 
margin. The tumor extensively invades the larynx submucosally involving a 
large poriton on the right, undermining of the right true and false vocal 
cords and invading through the right anterior thyroid cartilage with 
extension 
into the right and anterior perilaryngeal soft tissues closely approximating 
the right lateral soft tissue margin.  The tumor extends towards the base of 
the epiglottis and focally involves the pre- epiglottic soft tissue and 
extends 
inferorly involving the posterior aspect of the cricoid cartilage with 
extension to, but not into the right superior thyroid gland.  Separate from 
the main tumor is a 0.3 cm mucosal nodule at the inferor right epiglotic 
base.  The remainder of the laryngeal mucosa is tan without focal abnormalities.  
Thyroid and cricoid cartilages are moderately- to-severely calcified.

"," Site: Oropharynx
Justification: The report includes information about pathologic staging (pTNM), which indicates the location as the neck, throat, or oral cavity. In this case, the tumor is located in the oropharynx, which includes the back of the tongue, soft palate, and side and back walls of the throat.

Laterality: Not provided
Justification: The report does not include any information about the laterality of the tumor.

Histology: Squamous cell carcinoma
Justification: The report clearly states that the histologic type is squamous cell carcinoma, which is a common type of head and neck cancer.

Stage: pT4a pN2c
Justification: The report includes pathologic staging information (pTNM), with pT4a indicating a large primary tumor that has grown into nearby structures, and pN2c indicating the involvement of multiple lymph nodes on the same side of the neck.

Grade: G2
Justification: The report includes histologic grade information, which indicates the differentiation level of the cancer cells. In this case, the cancer is moderately differentiated (G2).

Behavior: Malignant
Justification: The report describes a malignant tumor, which means that it is cancerous and has the potential to invade nearby tissues and spread to other parts of the body.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Part 2: The thyroid tissue present in this lymph node extends into the parenchyma and shows focal nuclear features 
worrisome for papillary thyroid carcinoma. Thus, we would be reluctant to accept these as benign thyroid inclusions. If 
clinically indicated, work-up of this patient's thyroid should be performed.

GROSS DESCRIPTION 
(A) TOTAL LARYNGOPHARYNGECTOMY, BILATERAL NECK DISSECTION- A product of total laryngopharyngectomy and 
bilateral neck dissection with overall measurements of the laryngopharyngectomy without the dissection, 7.0 x 8.5 x 4.5 em and 
ulcerated excavating tumor mass involves entirely the left pyriform sinus and extending into the anterior soft tissue and involving 
the thyroid cartilage, measuring 4.5 x 3.5 x 8.0 em. The mucosal and soft tissue margin are grossly free of any involvement The 
tumor impinges mediale on the supraglottic region but does not involve the overlying mucosa. Separate tumor nodules were also 
noted in the anterior soft tissue component of the tumor. The nodules measures 1.0 em in diameter. The specimen is submitted 
as follows:

Laterality: Bilateral
Histology: Poorly-differentiated squamous carcinoma
Stage: Not provided in the report
Grade: Not provided in the report, but the use of ""poorly-differentiated"" suggests a higher grade tumor
Behavior: Invasive, as it involves the thyroid cartilage

Justification: The site and laterality are explicitly mentioned in the diagnostic statement. Histology is determined based on the description of the tumor. Stage and grade are not provided, but the term ""poorly-differentiated"" is often used to describe higher grade tumors. The behavior is inferred from the fact that the tumor invades the thyroid cartilage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pa~e 9 of 0  ICD-9 Diagnosis Codes: {None Entered} • "," Site: The site of the tumor is the oral cavity. This is based on the specimen type being a resection of a hemiglossectomy in the oral cavity.

Laterality: Not provided, as the report does not mention the side of the body or mouth where the tumor is located.

Histology: The histologic type of the tumor is squamous cell carcinoma, conventional. This is based on the microscopic examination and diagnosis provided in the report.

Stage: The tumor stage is pT2 pN2b pMX. This is based on the greatest dimension of the tumor being 3.5 cm (pT2), the involvement of 3 out of 2 regional lymph nodes examined (pN2b), and no evidence of distant metastasis (pMX).

Grade: The histologic grade of the tumor is G2, which indicates moderate differentiation. This is based on the microscopic examination and diagnosis provided in the report.

Behavior: The behavior of the tumor is malignant, as it is a cancer that has invaded surrounding tissues and metastasized to regional lymph nodes. This is based on the microscopic examination and diagnosis provided in the report.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The specimen is inked as follows: Posterior green, anterior at the midline orange strip, left blue, right black (left and  right anterior), and deep purple. There is a deep ulcer between two teeth       on the left floor of the mouth that is 2.0 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm and limited   anteriorly by left anterior soft tissue and the left mandible, posteriorly      by the tongue, and by the molar tooth and incisors medially and laterally.      The left anterior surface of the mandible is resected off the mandible  bone. The cut surface shows an ill defined hemorrhagic tissue right     underneath the ulcer. This comprises less than 5% of the section. The inner     portion of the mouth (floor of the mouth) is also resected off the bone to      reveal a well delineated soft white lesion that rises from the ulcer and        invades deeply and is 3.4 x 3.2 x 3.5 cm. This lesion is 1 cm approximately     from deep margin (is shaved and entirely submitted) purple; 0.6 cm from the     left bone and soft tissue margin (blue, shaved and entirely submitted); approximately 2.5 cm from the right bone and soft tissue margin (shaved and     entirely submitted; less than 0.1 cm from posterior soft tissue margin  inked green; 0.5 cm from the overlying tongue. Representative sections are      submitted following decalcification.            The mandible is sectioned to reveal normal cortical bone and bone marrow.

Comment:
In specimen G. bland appearing thyroid epithelium is present in
the subcapsular sinus of two lymph nodes. No parenchymal
involvement is identified, and no nuclear features of papillary
thyroid carcinoma are identified. This may represent benign thyroid inclusions in lymph node; however, a metastatic
carcinoma of thyroid origin cannot be excluded. Clinical
evaluation and imaging of the thyroid gland is recommended.

Addendum Comment
P16 is positive and HPV high risk is negative by ISH in a
representative section of invasive carcinoma (H3).
TTF-1 and thyroglobulin are attempted on G3 to highlight the
foci of thyroid glands within lymph nodes; however, both foci
are cut through and immunohistochemistry is not contributory.
The previous diagnoses are unchanged.

Justification: The specimen is labeled as ""Left radical tonsillectomy and left pharyngectomy"" with an ill-circumscribed, white firm tumor arising from the tonsil. Frozen section analysis of all margins was negative for carcinoma, but the tumor invades into the adjacent soft tissue and is 0.4 cm within the deep surgical resection margin. The left neck dissection specimen contains a 4.5 x 4.0 x 3.0 cm mass located 3.0 cm distal to the salivary gland, which is consistent with the primary tumor based on the surgeon's labeling. Six lymph nodes are identified in the Level TIB and VB lymph node specimens. The absence of a definitive stage and grade is due to the lack of information regarding the extent of spread to lymph nodes and the degree of differentiation of the tumor cells, respectively.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GROSS DESCRIPTION:  
The specimen is received in 11 parts.  
Part 1 is received fresh labeled with the pati ent' s name, initials xxx , and  
labeled ""neck dissection level 1A"".  Received is a fibroadipose tissue  
measuring 4.8 x 1.2 x 0.5 cm.  On serial sectioning, there are possible lymph  
nodes ranging in size from 0.1 to 0.3 cm.  The entire specimen is submitted in  
cassettes 1A through 1C.  
Part 2 is received fresh labeled with t he patient' s name, initials xxx , and  
labeled ""right composite resection"".  Received is a mandibulectomy specimen  
measuring 7.0 cm superior to inferior x 7.3 cm anterior to posterior x 4.5 cm  
medial to lateral.  The specimen includes mandibular bone, gingiva, lateral  
soft tissue, medial soft tissue, submandibular gland, three teeth and lymph  
nodes.   There is a white firm mass measuring 2.8 x 2.0 x 2.0 cm involving the lateral  
portion of the gingiva and the lateral buccal mucosa.  On sectioning of the  
mandibular bone, the lesion may grossly involve the mandibular bone.  The  
lesion does not appear to involve the medial side of the mandibular bone nor  
medial soft tissues grossly.  The lesion is 0.2 cm from the lateral soft  
tissue margin and 0.1 cm from the posterior soft tissue margin.   There is a lymph node adjacent to the submandibular gland which grossly appears involved.  This lymph node measures 3.8 x 2.5 x 3.2 cm.  This lymph node is necrotic, cystic and filled with yellow fluid.  It is located between  
the mandible and the submandibular gland approximately 0.3 cm from the  
inferior mandible and grossly abuts but is separated from the submandibular  
gland by soft tissue.  The submandibular gland measures 3.0 x 2.0 x 2.0 cm.  It does not appear involved by the lesion grossly.  There is also another  
lymph node that grossly appears involved measuring 1.8 x 1.3 x 1.2 cm.  It is  
located in the anterior inferior soft tissue and grossly appears to have some  
extra nodal extension.   
Other possible lymph nodes are found in the soft tissue.  These lymph nodes  
are tan, do not grossly appear to be involved, and range in size from 0.6 to  
1.0 cm.

1. Site: Supraglottic Mass, Right Base of Tongue, Pre-Epiglottic Space, Right False Fold Margin, Left Pharyngeal Wall, Right Pharyngeal Wall Margin, Posterior Pharyngeal Wall Margin, Revised Left Pharyngeal Wall, Right Hyoid Tissue A, Right Neck Dissection 2B, and Right Neck Dissection Level 2-4. (Some locations are repeated due to multiple samples taken or different test types.)
	Justification: The site of the biopsy or specimen is crucial for determining the origin of the pathology and its impact on treatment and prognosis.
2. Laterality: Right Base of Tongue, Left Base of Tongue, Right False Fold Margin, Left Pharyngeal Wall, Posterior Pharyngeal Wall Margin, Revised Left Pharyngeal Wall, Right Hyoid Tissue A, Right Neck Dissection 2B, and Right Neck Dissection Level 2-4.
	Justification: Laterality is essential for surgical planning, especially in cases with asymmetrical involvement or when considering potential functional impacts of treatment.
3. Histology: H&E (Hematoxylin and Eosin) stained sections are mentioned throughout the report, indicating that this category is available. The histological findings describe the nature of the cells and tissue present in the samples.
	Justification: Histology provides information about the type of tissue and cellular changes, which helps determine the specific diagnosis and potential behavior of the pathological process.
4. Stage: Not provided in the report. Staging typically requires additional clinical and radiographic information not included here.
	Justification: Staging is essential for determining treatment options and prognosis in malignant processes.
5. Grade: Not provided in the report. Grading usually applies to malignancies and describes their differentiation level, aggressiveness, or growth rate.
	Justification: Grading helps predict the behavior of a malignancy and assists in determining appropriate treatment options.
6. Behavior: The report does not explicitly provide information on the behavior of the pathological processes. However, some clues can be found in the histology results.
	Justification: Understanding the behavior (e.g., benign or malignant) is crucial for determining appropriate management and follow-up care.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

C)Received fresh in a container labeled ""composite resection"" is a 92 gm,
6.5 x 5.5 x 5.0 cm portion of soft tissue, mandible and eight attached teeth.
The margins of resection are inked as follows: orange posterior bone and
soft tissue, black deep, blue anterior soft tissue and bone. There is an
obvious 5.0 x 3.0 cm tan-yellow lobulated masson the underside of the
tongue, extending to the anterior portion where the gums meet the teeth. The
soft tissues are serially-sectioned to reveal a 4.3 x 3.0 x 2.0 cm tan-white
firm mass that appears to abut the orange and black margins but is grossly
free of the blue anterior margin. The mandible is serially-sectioned to
reveal tan-yellow firm cut surfaces. The tumor focally abuts the periosteum
but does not appear to grossly invade the bone. Sections of bone are
submitted for decalcification. Cassette list: Cl-C3 - posterior/right
margin, C4 - mass with closest relationship to orange (posterior/right
margin), C5 - mass with closest relationship to black (deep) margin, C6 -

0"," Site: The specimens are from the oral cavity, specifically the mandible and neck.

Laterality: The tumor involves the right side of the mandible and neck based on the description in sections C and B.

Histology: The final diagnosis is squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) for the primary tumor and metastatic SCC for the lymph nodes.

Stage: Based on the size of the primary tumor (4.3 cm), involvement of 2 out of 39 lymph nodes with extracapsular extension, and negative margins, the most likely pathologic stage is pT3N2b.

Grade: The primary tumor is moderately differentiated SCC.

^-^ L se is icirc"," Based on the given descriptions, here are the categorized interpretations:

Site: The sites include mandible (J), disc space (P1), pancreas (P2), and multiple sites (P3). This is based on the location where the specimens were taken from.

Laterality: Laterality is only provided for container J, which refers to the left mandible. For all other containers, laterality is not provided.

Histology: Histology is not explicitly provided in the descriptions. However, the presence of lymph nodes, tumors, and fatty fibroadipose tissue suggests different histologic types such as lymphoma, carcinoma, or adenocarcinoma.

Stage: The stage is not provided in the descriptions. This information is typically determined by the size of the tumor, its spread to nearby lymph nodes, and the presence of distant metastasis.

Grade: The grade is also not provided in the descriptions. This refers to how abnormal the cancer cells look under a microscope, which can help predict how aggressive the cancer may be.

Behavior: The behavior of the tumors is not explicitly stated but can be inferred as malignant based on the descriptions of their invasive properties and potential for metastasis.

Justification: These six categories were chosen because they are commonly used to describe neoplastic processes, including tumor location (site), spread (laterality), appearance (histology), extent (stage), degree of differentiation (grade), and potential outcome (behavior).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(6.0 x 5.0 x 0.8 cm) covering the anterior portion of the mandible, and bilateral submandibular tan soft tissue possibly salivary glands (4.0 x 3.0 x 
1. 5 cm each). 
An ulcerated necrotic lesion (2.5 x 2.0 cm) is present in the anterior floor of mouth extending into the tongue forming a fairly defined tan-yellow soft mass (2.0 x 1.5 x 1.1 cm), approximately 1.2 cm from the posterior muscle 
margin of the tongue. The lesion of the anterior floor of mouth also extends to the anterior portion of the mandible into the subcutaneous tissue of the 
skin forming a pink-yellow necrotic nodule (1.5 x 1.3 x 2.0 cm), 1.0 cm from 
the closest right skin margin. The lesion in the anterior floor of the mouth is 0.6 cm from the closest right gingival mucosal margin. Bilateral possible 
submandibular salivary glands are grossly unremarkable. 
Representative mucosal margins are submitted for frozen section 
dia~nosis. The remaining mucosal margin and representative sections of the 
leslon are submitted for permanent sections. Sections of the lesion through 
the anterior floor of mouth and mandible, and the posterior margin of the

"," Site: The specimens are from the right neck level 1, palate, additional deep tissue, and deep right margin.

Laterality: All specimens are from the right side of the body except for the left mucosal margin which is from the left side.

Histology: The histology includes squamous cell carcinoma in the right neck level 1 and deep right margin, and benign tissue in the palate, additional deep tissue, posterior mucosal margin, and left mucosal margin.

Stage: The stage is not provided in the description.

Grade: The grade of the tumor is not provided in the description.

Behavior: The behavior of the tumor is malignant in the right neck level 1 and deep right margin, and benign in the palate, additional deep tissue, posterior mucosal margin, and left mucosal margin.

Justification: The site is determined based on the description of the location of each specimen. Laterality is determined based on the labels on the containers or the specific mention of the side of the body in the description. Histology is determined based on the frozen section diagnosis for each specimen. Stage and grade are not provided in the description, so they cannot be determined. The behavior of the tumor is determined based on the frozen section diagnosis, with malignant indicating aggressive behavior and benign indicating non-aggressive behavior.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION: FFS: Markedly cauterized biopsy with single nest of
cauterized atypical epithelium versus nerve ;cannot rule out squamous cell carcinoma, final
diagnosis deferred. , FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
A-D, H) Lymph nodes, level 1 A, left selected neck, submandibular gland, left facial node, level
5 node, dissections:
1.Metastatic carcinoma present in four of 34 lymph nodes: 0/7 level IA, 0/4 level IIB (see
below), 1/8 level IIA, 2/8 level III, 1/5 level IV, 0/2 left facial, 0/1 level IV.
2. Foreign body giant cell reaction within one of the level IIB nodes suggestive of reaction to
necrotic tumor.
3. Submandibular gland with no evidence of carcinoma.
E) Left lingual nerve, biopsy: Large nerve fascicle with no evidence of carcinoma.
F) Peristyloid tissue, biopsy: Atypical cells suspicious for carcinoma.
G) Left tonsil fossa, composite resection: Squamous cell carcinoma with the following:
1. 5.0 cm greatest dimension.
2.Moderately to poorly differentiated.
3. Carcinoma infiltrates salivary glands and skeletal muscle (including tongue).
4. Carcinoma is extensively present at the cauterized superior aspect of the lateral surgical
margin (G2), focally at the cauterized posterior margin (G6), closely approaching the
inferolateral margin (G8), less than 0.1 cm to the medial uvula margin, and 0.4 cm from the
medial tongue margin.
H) Styloid process, excision: Carcinoma present in soft tissue; adjacent bone uninvolved.
COMMENT: Minimum pathologic stage: pT4aN2bMX (AJCC 2002) Procedures used to
establish the diagnosis: I Submit tissue for decalcification
ADDENDUM REASON: This addendum is issued to report the size of the involved lymph
nodes (all from part B) and the presence of extracapsular extension for the purpose of a clinical
trial enrollment. It was also noted that one of the level designations (part H, in bold below) and
the total number of nodes was incorrect in the final diagnosis. The remaining parts remain
unchanged. The corrected diagnosis with the additional requested information is as follows:
A-D, H) Lymph nodes, level 1 A, left selected neck, submandibular gland, left facial node, level
5 node, dissections: Metastatic carcinoma present in four of 35 lymph nodes: 0/7 level IA, 0/4
level IIB (see below), 1/8 level IIA, 2/8 level III, 1/5 level IV, 0/2 left facial, 0/1 level V. Foreign
body giant cell reaction within one of the level IIB nodes suggestive of reaction to necrotic
tumor. Submandibular gland with no evidence of carcinoma. The largest positive node is 2.5 cm
(level III) measured grossly. The three other positive nodes (level IIA, III, and IV) are
approximately 1.5 cm, 1.2 cm and 1.1 cm based on microscopy. Both level III nodes and the
level IIA node have extracapsular extension."," Site: Left tonsil fossa
Justification: The composite resection specimen from the left tonsil fossa contained a squamous cell carcinoma.

Laterality: Left
Justification: All specimens were designated as left-sided, indicating the origin of the tissue from the left side of the body.

Histology: Squamous cell carcinoma
Justification: The final diagnosis confirmed the presence of squamous cell carcinoma in the tonsil fossa and lymph nodes.

CASE: RECEIVED:'. A
CLINICAL DATA: f 4' 45W)'c/q))3
-year-old man with history of floor of mouth carcinoma (squamous cell
carcinoma).
GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A)Received in formalin designated ""left mandibular tumor"" is a composite
resection specimen that includes an 11 x 8.5 cm ellipse of medium tan,
hair-bearing skin with a central 2.5 cm in diameter ulcer and 8.5 cm in
diameter region of induration of the skin which extends focally to within 0.3
cm of the anterior cutaneous margin. A smaller, 4 x 0.9 cm ellipse of skin
is sutured to the main specimen at the left superior region. Partially
embedded in the attached 12 x 8 x 6 cm aggregate of deep soft tissue and
skeletal muscle is a portion of the mandible spanning from right anterior
premolar region to body of the left mandible. Seven teeth, including a right
premolar (with dental restoration), two incisors (one intact, one
fractured/decayed), two canine teeth (intact), a portion of the first left
premolar (fractured) and a premolar or molar with crown fractured or decayed
off at the root. The diagonally transected mandibular cut surfaces appear
grossly unremarkable, consisting of cortical and cancellous bone. Left floor
of mouth and the attached, approx. 2.5 x 3 cm portion of tongue are largely
replaced by an ill-defined, pale tan, firm, exo- and endophytic tumor mass
that has eroded through the mid-segment of the included left mandible (bone
appears grossly essentially dissolved). Anteriorly, the skin and soft tissue
is partially peeled off and sutured back on the mandible (this presumably
does not represent a true surgical margin). The medial, right and anterior
margin is inked blue and the left lateral, inferior and posterior black.
Representative sections are submitted as follows: Al - anterior midline
cutaneous margin; A2 - left anterolateral; A3 - left posterior/inferior
cutaneous; A4 - right inferior; A5 - right anteroinferior; A6 - right
inferolateral; A7 - right superolateral cutaneous, A8 - right anteromedial
gingival/tongue (shave margin, taken immediately posterior to transected
right mandible); A9 - tongue and right (medial) margin; A10 - mid-medial
margin; All - posterior soft tissue, lateral aspect; A12 - posterior soft
tissue, medial aspect. Bisection of the specimen across the extensively
eroded mandible now reveals a 3 cm diameter soft, red-brown, friable cavity
and demonstrates that the firm, pale tan tissue grossly consistent with tumor
extends essentially to the medial soft tissue margin, grossly. Submitted in
A13 - region of destroyed mandible (mid-segment) and closest adjacent margin;
A14 and A15 (decal) - mandible end margins. All margin sections are
perpendicular unless stated otherwise.
B)Received in formalin designated ""left neck level II"" is a 5 x 4 x 1 cm
aggregate of fibroadipose tissue containing multiple lymph nodes of up to 1.5
cm in diameter. The largest node is bisected and submitted in cassette B1,
the remaining smaller nodes intact in B2.
C)Received in formalin designated ""left neck level III"" is an 8 x 1.5 x
0.8 cm strand of fibroadipose tissue containing multiple lymph nodes of up to
1.0 cm diameter. All are submitted intact in cassette Cl. D)Received in formalin designated ""teeth"" are three teeth and six
fragments of unoriented tooth material. The largest tooth, molar, measures
1.8 x 1 x 0.7
cm and has calculus material attached, and the neck of the tooth has dark
brown discoloration. The next largest tooth is a 2.2 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm incisor.
Its crown appears to be a restoration of porcelain and silver-colored metal
crown. The root is discolored at the junction with the crown. The third is a
2 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm incisor which appears intact. The remaining fragments of
dentin, and tan-gray material range up to 0.7 cm in greatest dimension.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
A)Left mandible, composite resection:
1.Squamous cell carcinoma, keratinizing, moderately to poorly
differentiated
a.Size: est. at least 8 cm
b.Involving floor of mouth, tongue, anterolateral skin (ulcerated) and
parotid gland, and penetrating the mandible.
c.Carcinoma present at margin of resection in left inferoposterior and
right inferior subcutaneous soft tissue;
- within 0.03 cm of (if not at) the right medial and left posterolateral
(parotid region) soft tissue margin,
- within 0.1-0.2 cm of medial posterior soft tissue,
- other visualized margins clear by at least 0.3 cm.
--Decalcification of the mandibular end margins is pending - see subsequent
addendum.
d.Perineural invasion present.
e.Focally suspicious for angiolymphatic invasion.
2.Chronic sialadenitis.
B)Left level II, neck dissection: Squamous cell carcinoma present in one
of 8 lymph nodes (1/8).
C)Left level III, neck dissection: No carcinoma identified in 6 nodes
(0/6).
D)""Teeth"", extraction: One molar, two incisor teeth, and multiple
fragments of tooth material. (Gross evaluation only).
COMMENT:
The minimum pathologic stage is pT4a, pNl, pMX (AJCC TNM Classification, 6th
ed., 2002).
ADDENDUM COMMENT:
After decalcification, the mandibular margins of the part A specimen (A14 and
A15, both en-face sections) are examined:
A14 - Right mandibular margin - free of carcinoma.
A15 - Left mandibular margin (posterior-superior) - carcinoma present within
bone, soft tissue and perineural space.

Justification: The primary tumor was identified in the left mandible with extensive involvement of surrounding tissues.

Laterality: Left
Justification: The tumor was located on the left side of the mouth, affecting the floor of the mouth, tongue, anterolateral skin, and parotid gland.

Histology: Squamous cell carcinoma, keratinizing, moderately to poorly differentiated
Justification: The tumor is characterized by the presence of malignant squamous cells with varying degrees of differentiation and keratin production.

Stage: pT4a, pN1, pMX (AJCC TNM Classification, 6th ed., 2002)
Justification: The tumor has invaded the mandible, measured at least 8 cm in size, and metastasized to one of eight lymph nodes in level II of the left neck. No carcinoma was identified in six nodes from level III of the left neck.

Grade: Moderately to poorly differentiated
Justification: The tumor shows moderate to poor differentiation, indicating a more aggressive behavior and higher potential for recurrence or metastasis.

Behavior: Malignant
Justification: Squamous cell carcinoma is a malignant neoplasm with the potential for local invasion and distant metastasis, requiring appropriate treatment and follow-up care.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
A)Right buccal margin, excision: Squamous mucosa with no evidence of in
situ or invasive carcinoma.
B)Right maxillary tumor, maxillectomy: Poorly differentiated invasive
squamous cell carcinoma with the following features:
1.2.6 cm.
2.Extent: Carcinoma erodes through the maxillary bone.
3.Margins:
a.Carcinoma involves the orange-inked posterior specimen margin, the
green-inked medial specimen margin and the black-inked lateral specimen soft
tissue margins; see comment.
b.The anterior soft tissue margin is negative for carcinoma.
c.Carcinoma involves the medial maxillary bone margin (hard palate);
anterior maxillary bone margin and bones
of the maxillary sinus are negative for carcinoma.
4.Extensive lymphovascular invasion is identified.
5.Focal perineural invasion is present.
6.The minimum pathologic stage is pT4a,pNx,pMx (AJCC,2002, 6th edition).

10. Repeat medial resection.
11. Medial maxillary wall.
N)Tooth #5, extraction (gross only): Tooth with silver amalgam and no
gross diagnostic alterations.
COMMENT:
Evaluation of the maxillectomy specimen (B) was supplemented by
intraoperative evaluation of multiple surgical margins by frozen section.
Although several specimen margins are positive (see above), final surgical
margins should be based on a correlation of all examined specimens in the
surgical context.
Procedures used to establish the diagnosis:
Routine"," Site: Right maxillary tumor
Laterality: Right
Histology: Poorly differentiated invasive squamous cell carcinoma
Stage: Minimum pathologic stage is pT4a,pNx,pMx (AJCC, 2002, 6th edition)
Grade: Not provided
Behavior: Malignant tumor with local invasion and potential for metastasis

Justification: The specimen was received as a maxillectomy for a right-sided maxillary tumor. The histology reveals poorly differentiated invasive squamous cell carcinoma, which is known to be malignant and aggressive. The stage is provided based on the pathologic findings of tumor size (2.6 cm), bone invasion, and margin positivity. The behavior of this tumor is malignant, with local invasion and potential for metastasis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

File under: Pathology"," Site: Anterior portion of the anterior mandible, including the alveolar ridge, skin on the anterior portion, and oral mucosa on the posterior portion.
Justification: The report describes a partial mandibulectomy specimen that includes the anterior portion of the anterior mandible, skin, and oral mucosa, with tumor present in these areas.

Laterality: Left side of the mouth
Justification: The report mentions a purple, multinodular, and raised tumor at the left corner of the mouth, as well as satellite tumor nodules throughout the specimen that are located closer to the left upper and lower lip margins.

Histology: Squamous cell carcinoma
Justification: The report does not provide a specific histological diagnosis, but squamous cell carcinoma is the most common type of cancer in oral cavity and lips, and it is consistent with the description of the tumor as raised, multinodular, and ulcerated.

Stage: Not provided
Justification: The report does not include information about the size of the primary tumor, involvement of lymph nodes, or distant metastasis, which are necessary for staging.

Grade: Not provided
Justification: The report does not include information about the degree of differentiation or other features that would allow for grading of the tumor.

Behavior: Malignant
Justification: The report describes a cancerous tumor with satellite nodules, and the diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma implies malignancy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MOLECULAR ANATOMIC PATHOLOGY TESTING:  
      
Block 3K:  
      
A.          HRAS mutation IDENTIFIED (p.Q61K, c.181C>A).  
B.          Mutations in BRAF, NRAS61, KRAS12/13 NOT identified.  
C.          FISH test for RET/PTC rearrangement is pending.  
      
NOTE:   
DNA was extracted in the amount sufficient for testing.  
      
BACKGROUND:  
Mutations in either BRAF or RAS genes or RET/PTC rearrangements are found in  
more than 70% of papillary thyroid carcinomas (1). BRAF V600E (T1799A)  
mutation has been associat ed with more aggressive behavior of papillary  
carcinoma (2, 3).  The association between BRAF V600E mutation and features of  
tumor aggressiveness have also been observed in papillary microcarcinomas (4).  
 Mutations in the RAS genes or PAX8/PPARg rearrangem ent occur in ~70% of  
follicular thyroid carcinomas and with lower frequency in oncocytic (H?rthle  
cell) carcinomas (5). Regarding the specificity of these mutations for cancer,  
BRAF V600E mutation and RET/PTC and PAX8/PPARg rearrangements are overall  
speci fic for malignancy in the thyroid, although they have been reported with  
a very low frequency in benign thyroid lesions (6).  RAS mutations occur in malignant and benign thyroid tumors, being found in  ~40- 50% of follicular  
and anaplastic carcinomas, 30 -40% of follicular adenomas and 10- 15% of  
papillary carcinomas (6).

MUTATIONAL ANALYSIS:  
For paraffin -embedded surgical specimens, manual microdissection was performed  
to collect tumor tissue.  Specimens with the minimum of 50% of tumor cells in  
a microdissection target are accepted for the analysis. Optical density  
readings were obtained. Real -time PCR was perfor med on the LightCycler  
platform to amplify BRAF codons 599- 601, NRAS codon 61, HRAS codon 61, and  
KRAS codons 12/13 sequences.  Post -PCR melting curve analysis was used to  
detect possible mutations. If required, the mutation type was confirmed by  
Sanger sequencing of the PCR product on ABI3130.  DNA from samples positive  
for each of these mutations was used as positive controls. Amplification at 35  
cycles or earlier was considered sufficient for the analysis. The limit of  
detection is approximately 10 -20% of alleles with mutation present in the  
background of normal DNA.

GROSS DESCRIPTION 
(A) LARYNGOPHARYNGECTOMY , BILATERAL NECK DISSECTION , CHECK MUCOSAL MARGIN ON THE PHARYNX 
AND TRACHEA - A total laryngectomy specimen , including larynx (12.0 x S.O x 5.0 cm) and bilateral attached neck 
dissections (12.0 x 4.0 x 2.5 cm). There is a pink-tan, exophytic tumor (5.5 x 3.0 x 2.5 cm) involving the left false vocal cords 
that extends superiorly to involve the left aryepiglottic fold, the left pyriform sinus, and left epiglottis. The true vocal cords are 
uninvolved . Posteriorly , the tumor appears to extend submucosally to the overlying hypopharyngeal mucosa. The tumor 
measures 2.0 cm from the closest left inferior posterior pharyngeal mucosal margin and S.O cm from the laryngeal margin. 
There is a tracheostomy site identified that is surrounded by a rim of tan-brown , partially wrinkled skin (S.O x 3.0 x 2.0 cm) that 
is grossly uninvolved by tumor. The uninvolved laryngeal mucosa appears grossly unremarkable . A portion of possible 
thyroid tissue along the left neck is present (2.2 x 2.0 x 0.4 cm). Sections of tumor and normal laryngeal mucosa are taken for 
tissue bank, and the specimen is submitted to the bone lab.

"," Site: Oral Cavity
The site is designated as the oral cavity based on the specimen type being a resection: left subtotal glossectomy and mandibulectomy.

Laterality: Left
The laterality is left since the resected specimen is from the left side of the oral cavity.

Histology: Squamous cell carcinoma, conventional
Histology is squamous cell carcinoma, conventional, as stated in the histologic type section of the synoptic data.

Stage: pT4a pN2c pMX
The stage is given as pT4a pN2c pMX, representing primary tumor (pT), regional lymph nodes (pN), and distant metastasis (pM) stages, respectively.

Grade: G2
The grade is G2, which indicates moderate differentiation of the squamous cell carcinoma.

Behavior: Malignant
The behavior is malignant because squamous cell carcinoma is a type of cancer and has the potential to invade surrounding tissues and spread to other parts of the body. This information is not explicitly provided in the report, but it can be inferred based on the histologic type being squamous cell carcinoma and the presence of lymph node involvement and venous/lymphatic invasion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patient is a 64-year-old woman with a history of left breast mass. A core needle biopsy was performed. The specimen consists of two fragments of tan-pink tissue. The larger fragment measures 0.9 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm and the smaller fragment measures 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm. Microscopic description: The tumor is composed of cells arranged in cords and nests, with focal comedo necrosis. The tumor cells have high nucleus to cytoplasm ratio, vesicular chromatin, and conspicuous nucleoli. Mitotic figures are easily identified. Immunohistochemical stains show the tumor cells to be positive for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2 neu. The background shows extensive lymphocytic infiltration. No ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or invasive carcinoma is identified in the surrounding breast tissue.

1. ""Site"": left breast. Justification: The report mentions a left breast mass and the biopsy was performed on the left breast.
2. ""Laterality"": left. Justification: The tumor is located in the left breast, as stated in the report.
3. ""Histology"": Invasive ductal carcinoma. Justification: The report mentions the tumor cells are arranged in cords and nests with focal comedo necrosis, consistent with invasive ductal carcinoma.
4. ""Stage"": Not provided. Justification: The TNM stage cannot be determined from this report as it does not mention the size of the tumor, lymph node involvement, or metastasis.
5. ""Grade"": Grade III (High grade or poorly differentiated). Justification: The tumor cells have high nucleus to cytoplasm ratio, vesicular chromatin, and conspicuous nucleoli with easily identified mitotic figures, all of which are features of a high-grade tumor.

MICROSCOPIC:
The microscopic findings substantiate the diagnosis.
The following statement applies to all immunohistochemistry, Insitu
Hybridization Assays (ISH & FISH), Molecular Anatomic Pathology, and
Immunofluorescent Testing:
The testing was developed and its performance characteristics
determined by
the as required by
the CLIA
'88 regulations. The testing has not been cleared or approved for the
specific use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, but the FDA has
determined such approval is not necessary for clinical use. Tissue
fixation
ranges from a minimum of 6 to a maximum of 96 hours.
Immunohistochemical
stains (where applicable) are performed with appropriate positive and
negative
control reactions. Immunohistochemistry assays have not been validated
on
decalcified tissues. Results should be interpreted with caution given
the
raised possibility of false negativity on decalcified specimens.
This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement
Amendments of 1988 (""CLIA"") as qualified to perform high-complexity
clinical
testing. Pursuant to the requirements of CLIA, ASR's used in this
laboratory have been established and verified for accuracy and precision.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
D)Oral cavity, composite resection and bilateral level 1 neck dissection:
Invasive squamous cell carcinoma with the following features:
1.Moderately to poorly differentiated.
2.4.0 cm in greatest dimension.
3.Carcinoma involves the anterior floor of mouth with extension to the
left and right and invades the underlying mandible. 4.Metastatic carcinoma in 1 of 3 level I lymph nodes (1/3) measuring 0.5
cm on the left; no definite extracapsular extension identified.
5.Carcinoma is present at the left anterior submucosal/subcutaneous lower
lip margin and left gingival margin.
6.Mandibular bone margins are free of carcinoma.
7.Perineural invasion is identified.
8.Angiolymphatic invasion is identified.
9.Minimum pathologic stage is pT4aN2 (AJCC, 7th Edition; 2010); see
comment.

COMMENT
The frozen section slides from specimen A were reviewed and the carcinoma is not
well represented on those slides The large tumor mass in the right neck does not
contain any lymphoid tissue within it, and may represent either a soft tissue
tumor deposit or (more likely) a lymph node which has been completely replaced by
tumor. If this is a replaced lymph node, there is extranodal extension of tumor
into the surrounding soft tissue. Immunohistochemical preparations, with
appropriately staining controls were performed on a representative section of
tumor from specimen B and show the following results: Tumor cells are strongly
and diffusely positive for p16 and show no circumferential membranous staining
for EGFR. HPV studies have been ordered and the results will be issued in a
separate report. .

Section code : J 1-J2 - entire specimen ,serially sectioned and entirely submitted after decalcification."," Site: The specimens are taken from various sites including floor of mouth, deep margin, medial margin, lateral margin, anterior margin, and anterior margin of mandible. This is necessary to examine the spread and severity of the disease in different regions.

Laterality: The laterality is specified for some specimens as right or not provided. This helps in identifying the affected side of the body.

Histology: Not all specimens provide information on histology, but Specimen 1 mentions a white/tan centrally located mass which may indicate a tumor. Histological examination is crucial for determining the type and nature of any abnormal growth or lesion.

Stage: The stage of the disease is not explicitly provided in these specimens. However, the extent of the surgical removal and number of lymph nodes examined can give an indication about the progression of the disease.

Grade: Like the stage, the grade is also not directly given. But the size, shape, and appearance of the mass could provide clues about its malignancy potential which is a part of grade determination.

Behavior: The behavior of the disease cannot be determined from these specimens alone as it requires clinical correlation and long-term follow up data. 

In summary, while many details are provided in these specimens, critical information like definitive histology, stage, grade, and behavior are not fully available. These would typically be determined after further laboratory tests and clinical evaluation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ials"," Site: The specimen is obtained from various sites including the anterior, left, right, and deep margins of the oral cavity, sublingual gland, and multiple levels of lymph nodes in the neck.

Laterality: The tumor is located on the right side of the oral cavity, and the sublingual gland is also from the right side. Levels 1, 2A, 3, and 4 of lymph nodes are dissected from the right side of the neck.

Histology: The tumor is a squamous cell carcinoma, which is confirmed by microscopic examination. The sublingual gland shows no distinct masses or lesions. The lymph nodes show various changes consistent with reactive lymphadenopathy.

Stage: The stage of the tumor is not provided in the description. However, based on the size and depth of invasion, it may be T2 or higher. The absence of metastasis to the lymph nodes suggests N0 status. Therefore, the tentative stage could be T2N0M0.

Grade: The grade of the tumor is not provided in the description. However, based on the size and depth of invasion, it may be a high-grade carcinoma.

Behavior: The behavior of the tumor is malignant, as it is a squamous cell carcinoma with local invasion and potential for metastasis to lymph nodes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Laterality: Some specimens are specified as left or right sided, such as Specimen L (left level 4) and Specimen M (left level 6). However, not all specimens have laterality indicated.

Histology: The histology of the specimens is not explicitly provided in the cassette summary. However, some specimens suggest the possibility of neoplasia or carcinoma based on the frozen section results and the inclusion of tumor sections.

Stage: The stage of the specimens is not provided in the cassette summary.

Grade: The grade of the specimens is not provided in the cassette summary.

The patient is a 64-year-old woman with a history of left breast mass. A core needle biopsy was performed. The specimen consists of two fragments of tan-pink tissue. The larger fragment measures 0.9 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm and the smaller fragment measures 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm. Microscopic description: The tumor is composed of cells arranged in cords and nests, with focal comedo necrosis. The tumor cells have high nucleus to cytoplasm ratio, vesicular chromatin, and conspicuous nucleoli. Mitotic figures are easily identified. Immunohistochemical stains show the tumor cells to be positive for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2 neu. The background shows extensive lymphocytic infiltration. No ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or invasive carcinoma is identified in the surrounding breast tissue.

1. ""Site"": left breast. Justification: The report mentions a left breast mass and the biopsy was performed on the left breast.
2. ""Laterality"": left. Justification: The tumor is located in the left breast, as stated in the report.
3. ""Histology"": Invasive ductal carcinoma. Justification: The report mentions the tumor cells are arranged in cords and nests with focal comedo necrosis, consistent with invasive ductal carcinoma.
4. ""Stage"": Not provided. Justification: The TNM stage cannot be determined from this report as it does not mention the size of the tumor, lymph node involvement, or metastasis.
5. ""Grade"": Grade III (High grade or poorly differentiated). Justification: The tumor cells have high nucleus to cytoplasm ratio, vesicular chromatin, and conspicuous nucleoli with easily identified mitotic figures, all of which are features of a high-grade tumor.

fixed in formalin for histological sampling. (AIFS; no reserve) 
(B) Received in formalin is a specimen labelled with patient's data and 
designated ""left submandibular gland"". It consists of a submandibular gland and 
3 additional irregular pieces of tissue. The submandibular gland measures 4.8 x 
3.4 x 2cm. The 3 pieces of tissue measure 2.5 x 1.S x O.Scm, 2 x 1 x O.Scm and 1 
x 1.S x 0.7cm respectively. The external surface of the submandibular gland is 
inked orange. Cut sections of the submandibular gland show normal appearance. No 
solid nodules are visible grossly. Some whitish nodular ill-defined areas are 
present in the smaller pieces.

pieces) 
MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION 
(AFS) Paraffin section of the frozen section specimen confirms fibrofatty 
connective tissue infiltrated by malignant tumour. Unfortunately in most areas, 
there is suboptimal preservation and many cells also show individual necrosis. 
There are numerous degenerate cells with presence of scattered pyknotic nuclear 
debris and interspersed macrophages. There is also diathermy and traumatic crush 
artefact. 
In areas where cells are better preserved, they appear to form sheets, and have 
enlarged pleomorphic vesicular nuclei, many containing prominent central 
nucleoli. No gland formation is seen. 
(B) Submandibular gland examined shows patchy mild chronic inflammation only. 
The separately received smaller specimens comprise fibrofatty connective tissue 
and residual lymph node infiltrated by sheets of tumour cells of similar 
appearance to that described for II1II. 
Immunostains demonstrate lesional cells to be positive with COlO, bcl-6, MUM-1 
and CD20. Cyclin 01, TdT, bcl2, AE1/3 and S100 are negative. CD3 highlights

"," Site: Oral Cavity
The location of the primary tumor indicates that it originated in the oral cavity.

Laterality: Left
The specimen is a left segmental mandibulectomy, indicating that the tumor was located on the left side.

Histology: Squamous cell carcinoma, conventional
The histologic type of the tumor is squamous cell carcinoma, which is the most common type of oral cancer.

Stage: pT4a pN0 pMX
The tumor was classified as pT4a based on its size and invasion into surrounding structures, pN0 because no regional lymph nodes were involved, and pMX because there was no evidence of distant metastasis.

Grade: G2
The histologic grade of the tumor is G2, indicating moderate differentiation.

Behavior: Malignant
The behavior of squamous cell carcinoma is malignant, meaning that it can invade and destroy surrounding tissues and spread to other parts of the body.

  Signature  
Resident Physician:   Attending Pathologist:  
I have personally conducted the evaluation of the above specimens and have rendered the above diagnosis(es).  
   
 
"," Site: The sites involved are the larynx, thyroid, left levels 2A, 2B, 3, and 4 lymph nodes, and right base of tongue. This is based on the description of the specimen and the location of the tumor.

Laterality: The tumor is located in the right supraglottic region, and there are mentions of left-sided lymph node levels. Therefore, this specimen involves both right and left laterality.

Histology: The histological diagnosis is not provided in the description. However, a white/tan firm mass suggests possible squamous cell carcinoma.

Stage: The stage is not provided in the description. Based on the tumor size (2.7 x 2.6 x 1.7 cm) and the extent of the tumor, it could be stage T2 or higher. However, without information about lymph node involvement, the stage cannot be accurately determined.

Grade: The grade is not provided in the description.

Behavior: The behavior of this lesion is that of a malignant neoplasm, as indicated by the tumor size and extent.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"," Site: Oral Cavity
The tumor is located in the oral cavity, as indicated by the clinical description and the pathology report focusing on this area.

Laterality: Left
The tumor is on the left side of the oral cavity, as stated in the pathology report (Resection: left mandible).

Histology: Squamous cell carcinoma, conventional, Grade 2
The histologic type is squamous cell carcinoma, conventional, and it has a grade of 2, which was determined through microscopic examination.

Stage: pT4a pN1
The pathologic staging (pTNM) indicates that the tumor's size is 2.3 x 1.5 cm (acral dimensions), and there is one involved regional lymph node without extracapsular extension. This corresponds to stage pT4a pN1.

Grade: Not provided
Although a histologic grade of 2 was given, the pathology report does not explicitly state the overall tumor grade. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer for this category.

Behavior: Malignant
The tumor behavior is malignant, as indicated by the diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma and the pathologic staging (pTNM).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"," Site: The site of the tumor is the larynx. This is based on the description of the location and attached structures in the synoptic data section.

Laterality: The laterality of the tumor is right-sided. This is specified in the first line of the description where it mentions a ""transglottic mass (3.8 x 3.8 x 2.0 cm) centered on the anterior commissure and involving the supra-glottis and subglottis, invading between the cricoid cartilage and thyroid cartilage into deep anterior soft tissue.""

Histology: The histology of the tumor is squamous cell carcinoma. This is mentioned in the synoptic data section where it states ""HISTOLOGIC TYPE OF TUMOR: Squamous cell carcinoma.""

Stage: The stage of the tumor is pT4a pN0 pMX. This information is provided in the synoptic data section. The T stage indicates that the tumor has invaded through the thyroid cartilage, the N stage indicates that there are no positive lymph nodes, and the M stage indicates that there is no distant metastasis.

Grade: The grade of the tumor is moderately differentiated. This information is provided in the synoptic data section where it states ""HISTOLOGIC GRADE: Moderately differentiated.""

Behavior: The behavior of the tumor is malignant. This is inherent in the diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma, which is by definition a malignant tumor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Justification: The site is specified as the right lateral oral tongue, and the patient was diagnosed with stage II squamous cell carcinoma. The intraoperative consultation did not identify high-grade dysplasia or malignancy at any of the margins, but the final pathology report is not provided. Therefore, the grade is not specified. However, since it's a cancer invading surrounding tissues and undergoing regional lymph node dissection, it is considered malignant with potential for metastasis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GROSS DESCRIPTION: 
The specimen is received in four parts: 
Part 1 is received fresh from identified with the patient's name with initia  and labeled as ""left buccal mucosa, left mandibular 
periosteum, left submandibular gland and left level 1"". It measures overall 10.5 x 7.5 x 5.0 cm and consists of a resection of the 
buccal mucosa with tumor (4.5 x 3.5 x 2.5 cm), soft tissue with 4.5 x 1.8 cm piece of mandibular periosteum and submandibular 
soft tissue with submandibular gland (2.5 x 2.8 x 1.8 cm), multiple lymph nodes. 
The tumor (4.5 x 3.5 x 2.5 cm) has an ulcerated necrotic surface and on sectioning comes within O.4-cm from the superior buccal 
mucosal resection margin, 0.3·cm from the inferior buccal mucosal resection margin, abuts to the deep tumorous section margin 
and is 4.8 cm from the inferior gingival mucosal resection margin. 
The periosteum is overlying and second ulcerated, spatially distinct mass (4.5 x 2.5 x 2.8-cm) which appears grossly extend into 
the submandibular gland. The soft tissue from the level 1 contains additional three lymph nodes, all replaced by tumor.

Right mandibular composite neck dissection, free flap. Diagnosis: FOM carcinoma.
GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A) Received fresh designated ""..., composite resection and right neck dissection ""is a 10 x 10 x
6 cm specimen consisting of a right mandible consisting of the ramus and body with the posterior
and superior aspect of the ramus surgically transected (the ramus measures 3.6 cm IS). The
anterior mandible is intact and a portion of the mental protuberance is present just past the
midline. There is a firm irregular nodular mass (5.5 x 3 .5 x 3.5 cm )in the right floor of the
mouth ,invading into the mandible and possibly extending into the surrounding soft tissue.
Laterally the mandible is covered by muscle ,fibroadipose tissue and an elliptical portion of skin
(6 x 3.5 cm )with a central defect measuring 1 x 0.2 cm .The inferior margin of the specimen
consists of skeletal muscle (digastric muscle )and there is an inferior collection of fibroadipose
tissue measuring 8 x 5.5 x 1 cm on the right and extending to the left side a collection of
fibroadipose tissue measuring 5 x 1 x 0.3 cm. The anterior right lateral soft tissue margin is
inked blue and representative sections are taken for intraoperative frozen section examination.
There are several designating sutures in this specimen .A double long designates right level III;
a double short designates right level I; a single short designates left level I .The double long and
short sutures are present in the previously described fibroadipose tissue on the right side and the
single suture is present on the aggregate of fibroadipose tissue extending to left aspect. The
specimen is inked as follows: lateral -blue; inferior black ;posterior - orange ;anterior - yellow;
superior -green .The lesion appears to be within 0.5 cm of the inked lateral blue margin, 0.3 cm
of the inked green superior margin ,0.8 cm of the inked orange posterior margin, 0.5 cm of the
inferior black inked margin and free of the anterior yellow inked margin .Cross sections
demonstrate a submandibular gland at level I with no suspicious nodularities .Multiple potential
lymph nodes are identified in right level II with the single largest potential node measuring 2 cm
in maximum dimension .Multiple potential lymph nodes are dissected from right level III, the
largest of which measures 0.5 cm in maximum dimension .Dissection of left level I segment
demonstrates multiple potential lymph nodes ,the largest of which measures 1 cm in maximum
dimension .Cassette index :AFS 1-2 - freeze thaw sections of right lateral margin ;A3-A5 -
representative sections of lateral margin ;A6 - representative section of cutaneous fragment with
central defect ;A7-A8 - composite section extending from the superior green inked margin, to

bulging
nodule (5.5 x 3.5 x 1.5 cm) present within level II. The cut surface is
firm,
tan-white, lobular and solid.
The specimen is divided into levels 2 thru 4. In addition to the
dominant
level II nodule, multiple soft to moderately firm, tan-gray to pink-red
lymph
nodes ranging 0.3 to 2.0 cm in greatest dimension are identified on
dissection.

larynx"". It
consists of a total laryngectomy 9.7 x 7.2 x 4.5 cm, 4.6 x 1.3 x 0.9 cm
attached hyoid bone, three tracheal rings and a moderate amount of
anterior
soft tissue and muscle.
There is a 4.5 x 2.3 x 1.8 cm (depth), well-defined, moderately firm,
tan-white, focally hemorrhagic, exophytic supraglottic lesion involving
the right aspect of epiglottis, base of the epiglottis, right false vocal
cord and
anterior commissure .The ventricle is compressed but grossly the right
true
vocal cord is uninvolved. On cross-section the lesion penetrates
through the
epiglottis invading the para epiglottic fat, coming to within 0.8 cm of
the
base of tongue mucosal resection margin, 1.0 cm from the anterior soft
tissue
margin, 0.3 cm from the right aryepiglottic mucosal margin and 4.0 cm
from the
third tracheal ring margin. The left false and true vocal cords are
smooth,
soft, pliable and grossly uninvolved.
The remaining laryngeal mucosa is smooth, tan-pink-red and mildly
edematous in
the glottic region. The thyroid cartilage is unremarkable.
Digital images are taken. The right supraglottic lesion is procured
for the
clinical tissue bank.

Justification: The tumor is identified as squamous cell carcinoma, and the grade of differentiation is reported as poorly differentiated or undifferentiated.

Stage: pT3, pN2b, cM0
Justification: Based on the AJCC staging system for laryngeal cancer, the tumor size (pT3), positive lymph nodes on both sides with extracapsular spread (pN2b), and no evidence of distant metastasis (cM0) are reported.

Grade: Poorly differentiated/Undifferentiated
Justification: The grade of the tumor is specified as poorly differentiated or undifferentiated in the report.

Behavior: Malignant
Justification: The tumor is a malignancy, which is indicated by the presence of lymph node metastases and vascular invasion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Surgical Pathology Report I 
File under: Pathology I "," Site: Left ventral tongue, right alveolar ridge, left alveolar ridges (new), new right alveolar ridge, and partial mandibulectomy specimen - These are the specific sites from where the tissue samples were taken for examination.

Laterality: Left and right sides of the oral cavity are identified, which is important in determining the location and extent of any lesions or abnormalities.

Histology: Squamous mucosa, invasive squamous cell carcinoma, focal dysplasia - These terms describe the type of tissue present in the samples and any abnormalities found.

Stage: Not provided - The stage of a cancer describes its size and extent of spread, which is typically determined after a combination of physical examination, imaging studies, and pathological evaluation. Based on the information provided, it is not possible to determine the stage of the squamous cell carcinoma.

Grade: Not provided - The grade of a tumor describes how abnormal the cells look under a microscope and how quickly they are likely to grow and spread. This information is typically provided in a pathology report when a cancer diagnosis is made.

Behavior: Invasive squamous cell carcinoma - This term describes the behavior of the tumor, which in this case is an invasive cancer that has the potential to spread to other parts of the body.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

History Case Pathology"," Site: Right supra-glottic larynx, right and left neck nodes
Laterality: Right and left
Histology: Invasive moderately differentiated squamous carcinoma
Stage: Not provided in the report
Grade: Moderate
Behavior: Malignant
Justification: The report clearly states the diagnosis of invasive moderately differentiated squamous carcinoma for the right supra-glottic larynx and right and left neck nodes. However, information about the stage is not provided in the report. Based on the presence of tumor involvement in multiple lymph nodes, it can be assumed that the cancer has spread beyond the primary site, indicating a more advanced stage. The grade of differentiation refers to how closely the cancer cells resemble normal tissue and is an indicator of how aggressive the cancer may be. Moderate differentiation indicates that the cancer cells are somewhat similar to normal tissue but still have some features that suggest they are abnormal. This is consistent with the diagnosis of moderately differentiated squamous carcinoma in the report. The behavior of this type of cancer is malignant, meaning it can invade nearby tissues and spread to other parts of the body.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5.0 cm and 4.5 cm in depth). The mass involves the epiglottis, base of 
tongue, pre-epiglottic space and pyriform sinus. The tumor grossly extends to 
the anterior intrinsic muscle margins. The tumor is present in supraglottic 
space and extends inferiorly to 1 cm superior to true vocal cords. The lesion grossly involves both right and lateral aspects of the supraglottic space. 
However, the glottic space and infraglottic spaces are not involved. The tumor anteriorly approaches the hyoid bone. 
The true and false vocal cords, the trachea and salivary glands are 
unremarkable. Multiple lymph nodes are retrieved (ranging from 1.5 to 0.2 cm in greatest dimension). 
The tip of tongue is granular.

Printed on: (End of Report)"," Site: Hard palate and maxilla - The tumor is located in the hard palate and has invaded the maxilla bone.

Laterality: Right - The tumor is located on the right side of the oral cavity.

Histology: Squamous cell carcinoma - The tumor is composed of squamous cells, which are a common type of cancer cell found in the mouth and other areas of the body.

Stage: pT2 - The primary tumor is more than 2 cm but not more than 4 cm in greatest dimension (based on the size of the ulcerative mass). The regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed (pNX) and there is no distant metastasis (pM0).

Grade: G1, well differentiated - The tumor cells are well differentiated, which means they look and organize themselves much like normal squamous epithelium.

Behavior: Malignant - The tumor is aggressive and has the potential to invade and destroy surrounding tissues, as evidenced by its invasion into the maxilla bone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"," Site: The site is not explicitly mentioned in the report, but based on the context, it appears to be a squamous non-keratinized carcinoma found in normal tissues (G3).

Laterality: Laterality is not provided or discernible from the information given.

Histology: The histological diagnosis is squamous non-keratinized carcinoma (G3). This type of cancer originates in the squamous cells that line the epithelium, and it has not yet formed keratin pearls.

Stage: The report does not provide information on the stage of the cancer. Staging requires knowledge of the size of the tumor, its spread to nearby lymph nodes or other organs, and the presence of any metastasis.

Grade: The grade of the cancer is given as G3, which indicates a high-grade malignancy with significant cellular atypia, rapid growth, and a poor prognosis.

Behavior: The behavior of this cancer is infiltrating or invasive since it has breached the normal tissue boundaries.

Justification: These six categories are standard for oncological reporting and provide critical information for determining the appropriate treatment and prognosis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

cell carcinoma. The bone margins are negative for tumor.I"," Site: Lower gingiva (gum) and lower alveolar process of the mandible
Laterality: Left
Histology: Squamous cell carcinoma, conventional type
Stage: pT2 pN1 (This stage is based on the 7th edition of AJCC/UICC TNM. The pathologic staging may change if bone invasion is found in decalcified sections.)
Grade: Moderately differentiated (G2)
Behavior: Malignant, as it is a cancer that can invade surrounding tissues and metastasize to other parts of the body.

Justification: The site is identified as the lower gingiva and alveolar process of the mandible, laterality is specified as left. Histology reveals a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. The tumor size (pT2) is more than 2 cm but not more than 4 cm in greatest dimension, and there is metastasis in a single ipsilateral lymph node (pN1). However, the staging information is based on the 7th edition of AJCC/UICC TNM, and it may change if bone invasion is found in decalcified sections. The grade is G2, which means moderately differentiated. The behavior of this tumor is malignant, as it can invade surrounding tissues and metastasize to other parts of the body.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gross Description 
1. The specimen is labeled with the patient's name and as Oral Cavity: Portion maxilla. It consists of a portion of right 
maxilla measuring 5.0 AP x 2.0 SI x 3.1 ML cm. It includes a portion of gingiva and roof of mouth/palate with four teeth. 
There is a tumor arising in the roof of mouth extending into the alveolar ridge going into the gingiva. The tumor measures 
2.2 AP x 0.8 SI x 2.1 ML cm. The tumor is solid in consistency and tan-brown in color. There is gross involvement of bone 
by the tumour. The tumor is located at 0.5 cm from the closest superior gingival margin. Remaining margins are as 
follows: Anterior gingival margin 2.3 cm; posterior gingival margin-1.1 cm; posterior palate margin-O.B cm; medial palate 
margin 0.7 cm. Representative sections are submitted. '.

The tumor shows varying histology including basaloid squamous carcinoma and portions with acinar/rosette formation whichsuggests a
component of adenocarcinoma. Because of the nested growth pattern, IHC for neuroendocrine markers were
performed and show negative chromogranin and focal non-specific positivity with synaptophysin. CK34BE12 and p63 show
positivity in the squamous component. The presence of squamous and glandular componentsalso raises possibilt ofpatchy
mucoepidermoid carcinoma, but the high grade histology, lack of intermediate cell population excludes that. Mucin stains were alsoperformed (PAS-D and mucicarmine) and focal mucin can not be excluded.
In regards to specimen #2, tumor extends to the deep margin; however the final deep margin in specimen #7 is negativecarcinoma.for

Gross Description:  
Received are twenty specimen containers, all labeled with the patient name.  
Part A is received additionally labeled ""right facial lymph node (FSA)."" The specimen consists of predominately yellow lobulated fibrofatty tissues having  
aggregate dimensions of 1.5 x 1 x 0.3 cm. Within these tissues there is a single  
lymph node candidate which is submitted for frozen section evaluation (FSA) with  
residual frozen section tissue submitted in cassette A.  
 
Part B is received in formalin and additionally labeled, ""right Level III lymph  
node"" and consists of a single nodular portion of pink -tan soft tiss ue grossly  
consistent with lymph node having a dimension of 1 x 0.8 x 0.8 cm. This lymph  
node is bisected and submitted entirely in cassette B.  
 
Part C is received fresh for frozen section evaluation additionally labeled,  
""right mental nerve (FSC)"" and consists of a single 4 mm   in greatestdimension  
gray-tan irregular soft tissue which is submitted for frozen section evaluation  
(FSC)"" with residual frozen section tissue submitted in cassette C.  
 D is received fresh for frozen section evaluation additionally  labeled, ""right  
masseter muscle (FSD)"" and consists of multiple fragments of red- brown apparent  
skeletal muscle having aggregate dimensions of 2 x 1.7 x 0.3 cm submitted for  
frozen section evaluation (FSD) with residual frozen section tissue submitted in  
cassette D.  
 Part E is received in formalin additionally labeled, ""right buccal mass"" and  
consists of a 12 x 7.5 by up to 7 cm portion of pink -tan to red- brown soft  
tissue consisting of skeletal muscle, apparent buccal mucosa and being partially  
surfaced by an ovoid portion of skin with vermillion component. The skin with  
the vermillion component has dimensions of 9.5 x 6 cm and the vermillion  
component has dimensions of 3 x 1.5 x 1 cm.   The buccal mucosa is remarkable for a large centrally ulcerated mass  which is  
6.8 x 5 cm ulcerated to a depth of up to 2.3 cm. The skin bearing component is  
essentially unremarkable with the exception of a suggestion of submucosal tumor  
extension to the proximal pole of the vermillion border (see gross photo). The entire c ircumferential aspect of the specimen is surfaced by tissues which are  
uninvolved by this tumor. The superior aspect of the specimen is inked in  
yellow, inferior aspect is inked green, the superficial aspect not surfaced by  
skin is inked blue. The proximal  aspect is inked red. The distal aspect is inked 
red on black and the deep aspect is inked black. Those portions of the specimen 
surfaced by mucosa and/or skin remain un- inked. Please note, these inked regions  
do not represent true margins (see frozen sect ions). There is no bony component  
identified with this specimen.  
  The specimen is subsequently step- sectioned proximal to distal to reveal a large  
centrally necrotic tan- white mass subjacent to the previously described region  
of ulceration which has overal l dimensions of 8 x 6 x 5 cm. Additionally this  
lesion approaches to within 0.8 cm of the inferior aspect of the specimen, 0.5  
cm of the superior aspect of the specimen and to within 3.5 cm of the proximal  
skeletal muscle margin of surgical resection and 1 cm of the distal margin of  
surgical resection. Additionally this mass courses beneath the more proximal  
aspect of the vermillion border (see cassette E1) and infiltrates the fatty  
tissues with limited necrosis (see cassette E5).  
 
Representative sections of ""mass"" are submitted in cassettes E1- E5. 
 Also received in the same container is an additional 2 x 1.5 x 1 cm of tan- brown  
nodular soft tissue possibly representing lymph node which is bisected and  
submitted in cassette E6.  
 Part F is received fresh for frozen section evaluation additionally labeled,  
""right pterygoid muscle (FSF)"" and consists of 1.8 x 1 x 0.3 cm of red- brown  
irregular soft tissue which is submitted for frozen section evaluation (FSF)  
with residual frozen section tissue submitted in cas sette F.  
 Part G is received fresh for frozen section evaluation additionally labeled,  
""inferior masseter margin (FSG)"" and consists of 2.5 x 1.5 x 0.3 cm of red- brown  
skeletal muscle which is submitted for frozen section evaluation (FSG) with  
residual fro zen section tissue submitted in cassette G.  
 H is received fresh for frozen section evaluation additionally labeled,  
""superior masseter margin (FSH)"" and consists of a 0.8 x 0.6 x 0.3 cm of  
fragmented tan- yellow irregular soft tissue which is submitted for  frozen  
section evaluation (FSH) with residual frozen section tissue submitted in  
cassette H.  
 Part I is received fresh for frozen section evaluation additionally labeled,  
""lateral masseter margin (FSI)"" and consists of multiple fragments of tan- yellow  
irregular soft tissue 1.5 x 1 x 0.3 cm submitted for frozen section evaluation  
(FSI) with residual frozen section tissue submitted in cassette I.  
 Part J is received fresh for frozen section evaluation additionally labeled,  
""right lingual blood vessel"" and c onsists of a single portion of tan- white  
irregular soft tissue which is 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm submitted for frozen section  
evaluation (FSJ)"" with residual frozen section tissue submitted in cassette J.  
 Part K is received fresh for frozen section evaluation a dditionally labeled,  
""medial pterygoid (FSK)"" and consists of a 1 x 0.7 x 0.4 cm portion of red- brown  
soft tissue submitted for frozen section evaluation (FSK) with residual frozen  
section tissue submitted in cassette K.  
 Part L is received fresh for frozen section evaluation additionally labeled,  
""right parotid margin (FSL)"" and consists of a 1.3 x 0.8 x 0.4 cm portion of   tan-yellow irregular soft tissue submitted for frozen section evaluation (FSL)  
with residual frozen section tissue submitted in cassette L. 
 
Part M is received fresh for frozen section evaluation additionally labeled,

fibrofatty tissues all of which have aggregate dimensions of 4.5 x 3 x 2 cm.  
There is no additional orientation offered or possible with this fragmented 
specimen. The parotid gland portion of the specimen features yellow  lobulated  
architecture without distinct masses. Sectioning through the additional soft  
tissues reveals multiple probable lymph nodes (six) that range from 0.4 to 1.4  
cm in greatest dimension. The tissues are submitted as follows:  
     Q1      essentially unremarkable salivary gland;  
     Q2      four whole probable lymph nodes;  
     Q3,4      one whole lymph node each cassette each bisected.  
 Part R is labeled ""right level 1- 4 neck dissection, double stitch on 4."" The  
specimen consists of a portion of yellow -tan to red- tan fibroadipose and  
fibromuscular tissue received with two sutures designated level 4. The specimen 
has overall dimensions of 13.5 x 8 by up to 2.8 cm. The specimen is divided into  
levels 1A and 1B, 2, 3 and 4. There is a salivary gland in lev el 1A that has  
dimensions of 5 x 2.5 by up to 1.2 cm. Sectioning through the salivary gland  
reveals a pink -tan, lobulated cut surface. Sectioning through the remaining  
level 1A reveals three additional lymph nodes up to 1 cm.  
 
The sections from level 1A are submitted as follows:  
     R1      salivary gland;  
     R2      two whole lymph nodes;  
     R3      one lymph node bisected.  
  Sectioning through level 1B reveals five lymph nodes, which range from 0.5 x 0.4  
x 0.4 cm up to 4 x 2.5 x 2.2 cm. The largest lymph node has a tan- white,  
degenerative suspicious cut surface. The suspicious lymph node approaches the  
interface of the salivary gland in level 1A.  
 
The lymph nodes from level 1B are submitted as follows:       R4 one cross section from suspicious lymph node;       R5      two whole lymph nodes;  
     R6      one lymph node bisected.  
 Sectioning through level 2 reveals a few lymph nodes up to 0.6 cm in greatest  
dimension. These lymph nodes are submitted as follows:       R7      multiple whole lymph nodes ;  
     R8      one lymph node bisected.  
 Sectioning through level 3 reveals three lymph nodes up to 2.2 cm in greatest  
dimension. These lymph nodes are submitted as follows:       R9      one lymph node bisected;  
     R10      one lymph node bisected;

 Sectioning through level 4 reveals multiple lymph nodes up to 1.1 cm in greatest  
dimension. These lymph nodes are submitted as follows:  
     R12 -13     multiple whole lymph nodes;  
     R14 -16     each with one lymph no de sectioned.  
 Part S is received in formalin additionally labeled, ""Level IA neck dissection""  
and consists of multiple fragments of tan- yellow soft tissue having aggregate  
dimensions of 3 x 2 x 1 cm. There is no orientation offered or possible with  
these tissues. By palpation there are two probable lymph nodes 0.5 and 0.7 cm in 
greatest dimension both of which are submitted in cassette S1. The remaining  
tissues are submitted entirely in cassette S2 and S3.  
 
Part T is additionally labeled, ""right maxillary  teeth"" and consists of three  
partially fragmented carious teeth some of which have indwelling amalgams and 
are consistent with bicuspid as well as two molars having dimensions of 2.2 x 1  
x 0.8 cm, 2.2 x 1.4 x 0.9 cm and 2.5 x 1.4 x 0.8 cm respectively. No sections  
are submitted on these gross only tissues. This portion of the case has been  
reviewed by staff pathologist     Microscopic Description:  
The histologic evaluation of the specimen demonstrates a poorly differentiated  
keratinizing squamous cell car cinoma that arises from the buccal mucosa.   The 
tumor is composed of malignant pleomorphic cells arranged in sheets and nest  
with squamous pearls of keratin in the more well -differentiated areas.   The 
tumor infiltrates through the muscles of the buccal muc osa into the soft tissue  
of the skin and abuts the mucosa at the vermilion boarder of the lip.   The tumor  
does not extend to the surface of the skin.   The tumor involves nerves with  
areas of angiolymphatic invasion.   The surgical resection margins are nega tive.  There is a single lymph node positive for metastatic keratinizing squamous cell  
carcinoma in slide R4.  
 
  
END OF REPORT  
       
      
 
"," Site: The site of the tumor is the buccal mucosa.

Laterality: The laterality of the tumor is on the right side, affecting the maxillary teeth and the anterior mandible margin.

Histology: The histologic evaluation reveals a poorly differentiated keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma.

Stage: The stage is not provided in the report, but it can be determined based on the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and metastasis. In this case, since there is one positive lymph node, the TNM staging would be at least T2N1M0.

Grade: The grade of the tumor is poorly differentiated, indicating a high-grade malignancy.

Behavior: The behavior of the tumor is malignant, with local invasion and metastasis to a lymph node.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

R-view.a^"," Site: The primary tumor site is provided for some specimens, such as the right glossectomy (tongue) in specimen M. However, many of the specimens are lymph node dissections from various levels of the neck, and the site is not provided or applicable.

Laterality: The laterality of the tumor is provided for some specimens. For example, the right glossectomy in specimen M and the left neck dissections in specimens A, N, and 0. However, some specimens do not have a specified laterality as they are not associated with a primary tumor site.

Histology: The histology of the tumor is not explicitly provided in the descriptions. However, specimen M describes an ulcerated lesion along the lateral tongue/floor of mouth, which suggests a squamous cell carcinoma. Additionally, some specimens are lymph node dissections, and the histology of any metastatic tumor cells would be determined by microscopic examination.

"," Site: Larynx
The site is determined by the location of the tumor, which in this case is the larynx.

Laterality: Left
The laterality is specified as left based on the pathology report indicating a total laryngectomy with tumor laterality being left.

Histology: Squamous cell carcinoma
The histology of the tumor is identified as squamous cell carcinoma, which is mentioned in multiple parts of the pathology report.

Stage: pT4a N0 M0
The stage is determined based on the TNM staging system, where T4a indicates a tumor invading through the thyroid cartilage, N0 signifies no regional lymph node metastasis, and M0 means no distant metastasis.

Grade: Moderately differentiated
The grade of the tumor is determined as moderately differentiated based on the histologic grade mentioned in the pathology report.

Behavior: Malignant
The behavior of the tumor is malignant, which is indicated by the diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma and further supported by the positive surgical margins and lymph node involvement.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

cell carcinoma .The bone margins are negative for carcinoma."," Site: Oral Cavity, Submandibular gland, Soft Tissue (tongue and sublingual gland)
Laterality: Right and Left sides
Histology: Squamous cell carcinoma
Stage: Not provided
Grade: Not provided
Behavior: Malignant, with invasion of cortical bone observed in decalcified sections of the mandible

The justification for the choice is based on the detailed description of the specimens provided, which consistently mentions the presence of squamous cell carcinoma, as well as the observation of bone invasion in the mandible. The laterality and site are mentioned throughout the text, and while stage and grade are not explicitly stated, they can be inferred to be relevant based on the description of the tumor and its behavior.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Part 3: As indicated above, there is a focus of malignant tumor involving soft tissue. Again, this might possibly represent a lymph node metastasis in which 
the nodal architecture has been completely obliterated. 
Part 5: The differential diagnosis includes adenosquamous carcinoma and 
acantholytic squamous cell carcinoma. The mucicarmine stain in the tumor is 
negative. Barring sampling problems, this tumor is best classified as acantholytic (pseudoglandular) squamous cell carcinoma rather than 
adenosquamous carcinoma.

A surgical suture is attached to one aspect of the        specimen, which is consistent anatomically with the anterior aspect. The        overlying mucosal surface of the specimen is pink-tan, smooth, shiny, and       remarkable for an area of central ulceration measuring 1.5 x 1.0 cm. This       area of ulceration overlies a palpable, firm mass exhibiting approximate,       palpable dimensions of 2.5 cm from anterior to posterior x 2.0 cm from  medial to lateral x 1.5 cm from superior to inferior. The opposite surface      of the specimen is red-brown and focally cauterized. The specimen is inked      in the following manner: anterior orange, medial purple, posterior yellow,      lateral blue, and deep black. The specimen is serially sectioned from   anterior to posterior to reveal a heterogeneous, white-tan mass with focal      areas of hemorrhage present immediately inferior to the mucosal surface and     exhibiting maximal dimensions of 2.5 cm transversely x 1.3 cm in maximal        depth x 1.5 cm from anterior to posterior. The mass appears to extend to        
 within 1.4 cm of the medial surgical margin, 1 cm of the lateral surgical       
margin, 1 cm of the deep surgical margin, and appears widely free of the        
anterior and posterior margins. Representative sections are submitted for       evaluation.

INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION: BFS,CFS,DFS: All negative for carcinoma
EFS,FFS,GFS: All negative for carcinoma
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
A) Tongue, right, partial glossectomy: Moderately to poorly-differentiated, invasive squamous
cell carcinoma, with the following features:
1. Size: 1.6 cm
2. Depth of invasion: 1.2 cm
3. Arising in a background of high-grade squamous intraepithelial neoplasia (carcinoma in-situ).
4. Lymphovascular invasion is not identified.
5.Margins :Invasive carcinoma extends no closer than 0.3 cm to the deep aspect of the posterior
lateral margin, 0.4 cm to the deep aspect of the anterior medial margin, and 0.5 cm to the anterior
lateral mucosal margin. All margins are free of in-situ carcinoma.
6.Minimum pathologic stage :pTl NX MX (AJCC , 6th edition , 2002).
B-G) Tongue ,anterior, lateral ,posterior, medial ,anterior deep, posterior deep, biopsies: No in-
situ or invasive carcinoma identified.

Reviewer Initii"," Site: Right partial glossectomy specimen corresponds to the described location of the tongue.

Laterality: The laterality of the tumor is provided as right-sided.

Histology: Moderately to poorly differentiated invasive squamous cell carcinoma is confirmed in the final diagnosis.

Stage: Based on the size (1.6 cm) and depth of invasion (1.2 cm), with no identified lymphovascular invasion, and negative margins, the minimum pathologic stage would be pT1N0M0 (AJCC 8th edition, 2017). However, the provided AJCC version is 6th edition, 2002, which does not have a specific T1 category for tongue cancer with this depth of invasion. Therefore, it's reported as pT1 NX MX.

Grade: The tumor grade is specified as moderately to poorly differentiated in the final diagnosis.

Behavior: Invasive squamous cell carcinoma exhibits malignant behavior.

GROSS DESCRIPTION
A) Received fresh, labeled and designated ""left near-
total glossectomy and part i p RPM ne k dissection zones1,2,3"",
is a glossectomy, pharyngectomy, neck dissection specimen. The tongue is 9.5 cm
anterior to posterior, 4.5 cm left to right and 3.4 cm superior to inferior. The
pharyngectomy specimen is 6.8 cm anterior to posterior, 3.0 cm left to right and
3.9 cm superior to inferior. The neck dissection is 8.0 x 6.1 x 3.4 cm. The
specimen is oriented per the specimen container as follows:
Single stitch superior tonsil margin, double long stitch left vallecula, double
short stitch neck dissection zone 3.There is another single stitch that is
oriented in person by a member of the surgical team as a prominent lymph node in
zone 1A on the left side. The specimen is inked as follows:
Right side of tongue margin = red
Base of tongue margin = blue
Inferior portion of tongue margin = black
Vallecula margin = orange
Posterolateral oropharynx margin = green
Superior tonsillar margin - yellow
Floor of mouth margin = orange
Lateral oropharynx margin = black
Gross photographs are taken.
The neck dissection tissue is removed and the resultant exposed tissue is inked
yellow. The tongue, left floor of mouth and left oropharynx contain a large
ulcerated mass with deep furrows and papillary structures. This irregular
ulcerated mass measures 7 x 4.5 cm. The ulcerations extend 1.8 cm into the
tongue from the surface. The lesion is 1.4 cm from the right tongue margin, 0.8
cm from the anterior floor of mouth margin, 0.9 cm from the superior tonsillar
margin, 2.3 cm from the posterolateral oral pharynx margin, 1.6 cm from the
vallecula margin, and 1.4 cm from the base of tongue margin. Small portions of
tissue have been taken from the lesion as well as uninvolved tongue for tissue
banking. The tongue is serially sectioned to reveal a white, fibrotic,
spiculated lesion that extends to within 0.4 cm of the deep margin.
Representative sections are submitted as follows:
(Al) Tumor to right tongue margin
(A2) Tumor to base of tongue margin
(A3) Tumor to vallecula margin
(A4) Tumor to posterolateral oral pharynx margin
(AS) Tumor to superior tonsillar margin

3) SOURCE: Left Composite, Jaw-Neck-TongueThe specimen labeled, ""left composite resection, tongue, jaw, neck,"" is
received fresh and is comprised of a mandibular resection extending fromthe right mandible anterior to the mental foramen, to the left angle ofthe mandible. Attached is the base of the tongue, floor of mouth, and asignificant portion of soft tissue from the left anterior lateralchin/superior neck. The left tonsil is attached. The specimen measures11.0 cm superficial to deep (anterior to posterior), 10.0 cm superior toinferior, and 6.5 cm medial to lateral. The overlying skin is pink-tan,hair-bearing, and possesses an ulcerated mass, measuring 8.5 x 5.8surface centimeters. The specimen is inked as follows on the resectionsurfaces: anterior-yellow, posterior-green, superior-red,inferior-black, lateral-blue, medial-orange. The left palatal tonsil ispresent attached to the specimen, and measures 2.6 x 1.3 x 2.2 cm. Thespecimen is sectioned to show the mass lesion extending deep into thespecimen to a depth of 5.5 cm and is comprised of a soft, white-tanparenchyma with an infiltrative border. This process surrounds andapparently invades the mandibular bone. The process comes within 0.3 cmof the lateral superior resection margin (blue). The tonsil is appearsfree of this process.

 "," Site: Larynx
Laterality: Right side involvement
Histology: Squamous cell carcinoma (based on description of the tumor)
Stage: Not provided (requires additional information such as lymph node status and absence or presence of metastasis)
Grade: Not provided (requires microscopic examination of tissue differentiation)
Behavior: Malignant (described as a fungating, firm, ulcerated tumor)

Justification: The site is mentioned as larynx in the specimen description. Laterality is determined by the location of the tumor and the fact that one side of the soft tissue is inked blue and the other black. Histology is inferred from the tan/white, fungating, firm, ulcerated mass described. Stage and grade cannot be definitively determined without additional information. The behavior is malignant based on the description of the tumor as well as its size and location.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

airway.  It is located 1.5 cm from the epiglottis, 0.4 cm from the 
closest 
left mucosal pharyngeal specimen edge, 0.3 cm from the closest right 
pharyngeal specimen edge, 3.3 cm from tracheal margins, and 0.4 cm from 
the 
anterior soft tissue margins (inked blue). 
On sectioning the tumor is tan- white, lobulated, firm with involvement 
of 
bilateral aryepiglottic folds.  It appears to compress the right 
epiglottic 
fold. The vocal cords appear uninvolved by the tumor. Tumor is less 
than 0.5 
 cm from the thyroid cartilage grossly.  The soft tissue and the thyroid 
gland 
show no involvement by tumor.  The mass appears to push through the 
mucosa 1.0 
cm above the right false vocal cord with nodule formation measuring 
0.3cm.   The right lobe of thyroid gland parenchyma appears firm, brown with no 
gross 
lesions.   
The right selective neck dissection is composed of fibroadipose tissue with portion of skeletal muscle.  Thirty- four possible lymph nodes, ranging 
from 0.4 to 3.0 cm are identified.  All of the lymph nodes are submitted for 
histology.  There is a large lymph node located at level 3 measuring 
3.1 x 1.5

"," 1. Site: The specimens are derived from various sites including left supraglottic larynx, right medial arytenoid, left medial arytenoid, base of tongue, pyriform sinus, and others. This is provided in the description of each specimen.
2. Laterality: The laterality refers to the side of the body where the specimens were taken. In this case, some specimens were taken from the left side, right side, or both sides. For instance, level 2 nodes-left and right medial arytenoid are examples of laterality in the report.
3. Histology: The histology is not explicitly provided for each specimen, but it can be inferred from the description and diagnosis. For example, the histology of level 2 nodes-left is benign lymph node, soft tissue of petiole is negative for carcinoma, right medial arytenoid has rare detached atypical cells, not diagnostic of malignancy, and others.
4. Stage: The stage is not provided in the report since it requires additional information such as the extent of the tumor, lymph node involvement, and metastasis, which are not available during the intraoperative consultation.
5. Grade: Similarly, the grade is not provided in the report since it requires further examination of the specimens by the pathologist.
6. Behavior: The behavior refers to whether the tumor is malignant or benign. In this case, some specimens are diagnosed as negative for carcinoma, indicating that they are benign, while others have rare detached atypical cells, not diagnostic of malignancy, which means further examination is required to determine their behavior.

"," Site: Right mental nerve, right anterior gingiva, right buccal margin, right palate margin, right pharyngeal margin, right floor of mouth margin, right tongue margin, right mandibular gingiva, right submandibular gland, and nerve at unspecified site. These are various locations in the oral cavity and neck.

Laterality: Right side for all sources.

Histology: Benign for all margins except for the right mandibular gingiva, which is a fungating mass but has not been given a specific diagnosis on frozen section. The submandibular gland is unoriented and does not have any visible masses or lesions on external examination.

Stage: Not provided as this typically requires knowledge of the extent of disease at the time of surgery and assessment of regional lymph nodes which are not included in these specimens.

Grade: Not provided as this is a frozen section report and final assessment of differentiation, necrosis, and mitotic activity would require permanent sections.

Behavior: Benign for all margins except for the right mandibular gingiva where malignancy is suspected but not confirmed on frozen section. The submandibular gland shows no evidence of malignancy on frozen section. Justification: The frozen section diagnoses for the various margins are reported as benign, indicating no evidence of dysplasia or malignancy in these areas. However, the right mandibular gingiva has a fungating mass which is not given a specific diagnosis on frozen section and will require further evaluation on permanent sections. The submandibular gland does not have any visible masses or lesions on external examination and representative sections show homogenous tan parenchyma without any masses or lesions, suggesting no malignancy but final assessment would require permanent sections.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

and ""base of tongue."" The specimen consists of a 0.8- cm in largest dimension 
fragment of soft tissue covering by gray- pink, soft mucosa.  Intraoperative 
consultation was requested for part 1 and was performed.  Part 1 is entirely submitted in cassette 1A. 
Part 2 is labeled with the patient's name, initials xx, medical record number 
and ""right soft palate.""  Part 2 consists of a 1.5 cm in largest diameter 
fragment of soft tissue, inked blue.  Part 2 is entirely submitted in cassette 
 2A. 
Part 3 is labeled with the patient's name, initials xx, medical record number 
and ""lateral pharyngeal.""  Part 3 consists of a 0.8 cm in largest diameter 
fragment of soft tissue.  Part 3 is entirely submitted in cassette 3A. 
Part 4 is labeled with the patient's name, initials xx, medical record number 
and ""medial pharyngeal"" and consists of a 0.9 cm in largest dimension fragment 
of soft- to-rubbery tissue.  Part 4 is entirely submitted in cassette 4A. 
Part 5 is labeled with the patient's name, initials xx, medical record number and ""right tonsils, suture medial"" and consists of a 5.5 x 4.0 x 3.5 cm 
fragment of soft tissue with an exophytic solid gray mass, 3.7 x 3.5 x 2.3 cm in largest dimension. The mass is 0.3 cm from the deep margin and is inked 
black.  Digital images are taken.  A portion is submitted for tumor bank.  
Representative sections of the tumor in its relationship to the deep margin 
are submitted in cassettes 5A- 5E. 
Part 6 is labeled with the patient's name, initials xx, medical record number 
and ""right neck levels 1- 4.""  Part 6 consists of a fragment of fibroadipose 
tissue, 9.0 x 6.5 x 4.0 cm in largest dimension. The specimen is distorted by a 6.5 cm in largest dimension mass, which is lobulated, encapsulated and has 
a 
yellow fragile necrotic- appearing cut section surface.  Digital images are 
taken. The mass is located at level 4. The remainder of the specimen contains 
an unremarkable lobulated major salivary gland tissue, 3.0 cm in largest 
dimension.  Several level 3 lymph nodes are identified. The largest level 3 
lymph node measures 0.8 cm in largest dimension. Representative sections are 
submitted as follows: 6A-6F -     representative sections of the large mass with capsule 
6G -     three lymph nodes, two lymph nodes (largest) are bisected 
6H -     representative section of major salivary gl d (submandibular). 
Part 7 is labeled with the patient's name, initials , medical record number and ""right neck level 5"" and consists of a 2.5 cm in argest diameter fragment 
of yellow, lobulated fibroadipose tissue with potential lymph node, up to 0.5 
argest dimension.

The sample consists of a 45-year-old male patient with a left supraclavicular lymph node excision. The lymph node measured 2.8 cm in greatest dimension and showed complete replacement by a metastatic carcinoma. The tumor cells were arranged in sheets and nests, with focal cribriform architecture. Immunohistochemical stains for keratin AE1/AE3 were positive, confirming the epithelial nature of the neoplasm. The primary site was not identified.

1. Site: not provided, as the primary site was not identified in the report.
2. Laterality: left, as the lymph node excision was from the left supraclavicular region.
3. Histology: metastatic carcinoma, as the report mentioned the presence of a metastatic carcinoma in the lymph node.
4. Stage: not provided, as there is no information about the TNM stage in the report.
5. Grade: not provided, as there is no information about the differentiation or grade of the tumor cells in the report.

MICROSCOPIC:
Microscopic examination substantiates the above diagnosis.
Part 5: Immunohistochemical stain for p16 (positive) was repeated on
Part 5
(in addition to Part 1) to better appreciate the extent of second focus
of
squamous cell carcinoma (contralateral focus).
The following statement applies to all immunohistochemistry, Insitu
Hybridization Assays (ISH & FISH), Molecular Anatomic Pathology, and
Immunofluorescent Testing:
The testing was developed and its performance characteristics
determined by
the as required by
the CLIA
'88 regulations. The testing has not been cleared or approved for the
specific use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, but the FDA has
determined such approval is not necessary for clinical use. Tissue
fixation
ranges from a minimum of 2 to a maximum of 84 hours.
This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement
Amendments of 1988 (""CLIA"") as qualified to perform high-complexity
clinical
testing. Pursuant to the requirements of CLIA, ASR's used in this

COMMENT:
Invasive poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (greater than 5 .0 cm) is
identified in the parotid glands .No squamous cell carcinoma in situ is
seen .The invasive squamous cell carcinoma could be from the overlying
skin, metastatic from other organs or primary tumor from parotid.
However ,primary parotid squamous cell carcinoma is very uncommon.

"," Based on the information provided in the pathology report, here are the details for the six categories:

1. Site: The tumor is located in the oral cavity, specifically in the right retromolar trigone. This is based on the ""Specimen Type"" and ""Tumor Site"" sections of the report.
2. Laterality: The tumor is located on the right side of the oral cavity. This is based on the ""Specimen Type"" section of the report.
3. Histology: The tumor is a squamous cell carcinoma, conventional type. This is based on the ""Histologic Type"" section of the report.
4. Stage: The tumor is at stage pT3 pN2b, which indicates that the primary tumor is larger than 4 cm and has spread to 2-4 regional lymph nodes. This is based on the ""Pathologic Staging (pTNM)"" section of the report.
5. Grade: The tumor is grade G2, indicating moderate differentiation. This is based on the ""Histologic Grade"" section of the report.
6. Behavior: The tumor is malignant, as it is a cancerous growth. This is implied throughout the report.

Justification for choice: These six categories are commonly used in pathology reports to describe the characteristics and extent of a tumor.

Comment:
Amendment Comment:
Following case finalization, it was brought to our attention
that there are different node staging systems for different
pharyngeal sites. For oropharynx, metastasis to multiple
ipsilateral nodes <6 cm in diameter is staged as N2b,
rather than as N1. The AJCC pathologic stage is revised, as
above.

Frozen Section Pathologist:, MD, PhD
Clinical History:
-year-old male with likely HPV+ tonsillar squamous cell
carcinoma.
Gross Description:
Specimen A is received is fresh for frozen section in one appropriately labeled container additionally labeled ""deep
margin, biopsy."" It holds three brown/tan soft tissue fragments,
1.5 x 1.0 x 0.4 cm in aggregate which are serially cauterized.
The entire specimen is submitted in block FSA1,
Specimen B is additionally labeled ""right pharyngectomy, long
stitch = soft palate, short stitch = tongue base"". The container
holds a single irregularly shaped pink/tan soft tissue fragment
with a single long stitch attached. A short stitch is present
detached inside the container. The specimen measures 5.4 x 3 cm
with a maximum thickness of 2 cm, and has an apex at the long
stitch and a broad base at the opposite end. The mucosal surface
shows a white/tan firm irregular mass which on sectioning
appears invasive and has a slightly mucoid cut surface. The mass
measures 2.2 x 3.1 cm across the surface of the specimen by 1.9
cm in depth. The deep margin is irregular, cauterized
fibromuscular tissue. The peripheral margin closest to the long
stitch is inked green and the peripheral margin of the opposite
half is inked blue. The deep margin is inked black. The mass
focally abuts the black inked deep margin and comes within 1 mm
of both blue and green inked peripheral margins. It is 0.6 cm
from the margin marked by the long stitch (soft palate margin)
and appears to abut the opposite end of the specimen. The long
stitch is designated 12 o'clock. The tumor is slightly off
center in the 12-3-6 o' clock half of the specimen.
Block Summary:
B1 - Perpendicular sections to the soft palate margin (long
stitch)
B2 - Perpendicular sections to the 6 0' clock end (broad base)
B3 - Perpendicular sections to 9 to 12 o' clock

History Case Pathology Report 
File under: Pathology History Case Pathology "," 1. Site: Larynx, specifically the Glottis, as the report mentioned the histology of the tumor in this area.
2. Laterality: Right, as the report clearly indicates the surgery and removal of lymph nodes on the right side.
3. Histology: Squamous cell carcinoma, as the report consistently mentions this type of carcinoma.
4. Stage: T2 N1 M0, as the tumor has invaded beyond the vocal cord (T2), there is metastasis to a single ipsilateral lymph node (N1), and no distant metastasis (M0).
5. Grade: Not provided, as the report does not mention the differentiation of the tumor.
6. Behavior: Malignant, as the tumor shows invasion of the surrounding tissues and lymph nodes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Breast,,"Invasive Ductal Carcinoma, NOS",,III (high grade),Malignant,TCGA-BB-7872.pdf,         ," Report: 
The sample consists of a fragment of tissue with a size of 3.5 x 2.4 x 1.2 cm. The specimen is white-gray and firm in consistency. Microscopic examination reveals a neoplastic proliferation arranged in solid sheets and nests, composed of cells with moderate to marked atypia, numerous mitotic figures, and areas of necrosis. Immunohistochemical stains show positivity for CK7, CK19, and GATA3, and negativity for ER, PR, and HER2. The final diagnosis is Invasive Ductal Carcinoma, Not Otherwise Specified (NOS), grade III (high grade).

1. ""Site"": Breast. Justification: The report mentions a breast tissue sample, and the diagnosis is a type of breast cancer (Invasive Ductal Carcinoma).
2. ""Laterality"": Not provided. Justification: The report does not specify whether the tumor occurred in the left or right breast.
3. ""Histology"": Invasive Ductal Carcinoma, NOS. Justification: The diagnosis given in the report is Invasive Ductal Carcinoma, NOS (Not Otherwise Specified), which refers to a type of breast cancer originating from the milk ducts and invading surrounding tissues.
4. ""Stage"": Not provided. Justification: The report does not contain information about the tumor size, lymph node involvement, or metastasis, which are necessary for TNM staging.
5. ""Grade"": Grade III (high grade). Justification: The report specifies that the tumor is grade III, indicating high-grade malignancy with marked atypia and numerous mitotic figures.
6. ""Behavior"": Malignant. Justification: The diagnosis of Invasive Ductal Carcinoma implies malignant behavior, as the tumor invades surrounding tissues (muscularis propria) and shows areas of necrosis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ADDENDA:
Addendum
The lymph node findings were reviewed in this case per request from Dr.
Additional immunohistochemical studies were also performed to
evaluate the lymphocytic component of the staging nodes resected.
The histologic sections, together with the immunohistochemical stains
evaluated, demonstrate lymph node with reactive, but non-specific
changes. A
broad immunohistochemical panel shows reactive germinal centers and
non-specific hyperplasia with polyclonal plasma cells. The findings
likely
represent reactive changes in response to metastatic carcinoma, as
documented
in the initial report.
These findings do not alter the initially rendered diagnosis.
Specific results of the additional immunohistochemical stains evaluatedare
summarized in the Table that follows.

Reviewer mrcials Ttr^ i^11FjE DISQ111,1 1
Ui, I., IDate Reviewed:"," Site: The site of the tumor is the supraglottic larynx. This was determined through direct laryngectomy and laryngoscopy procedures.

Laterality: The tumor is lateralized on the right side of the larynx, as indicated in the surgical records.

Histology: The histologic type of the tumor is squamous cell carcinoma, which was established through biopsy and microscopic examination.

Stage: The pathologic T, N, and M stages are pT3, pN2b, and pMX, respectively. This indicates a stage III cancer according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system for laryngeal cancer.

Grade: The tumor is moderately differentiated, indicating an intermediate level of malignancy between well-differentiated and poorly differentiated cancers.

Behavior: This type of tumor is malignant, as evidenced by the presence of lymph node metastases, extracapsular spread, intra-perineural invasion, vascular invasion, and positive surgical margins.

Note that some information, such as the specific clinical question, outside tissue diagnosis, prior malignancy, chemotherapy, organ transplant, immunosuppression, and other diseases, was not provided in the case synopsis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

oewA:"," Site: Right retromolar trigone, right and left neck dissections (levels IB, III, IV), right and left anterior and posterior gingiva, right base of tongue muscle, near total glossectomy (right side), possible lymph nodes from various neck dissection levels.

Laterality: Right side for the majority of specimens, with some left-sided specimens from the neck dissections and base of tongue muscle.

Histology: Squamous mucosa with focal atypical epithelial nests (right retromolar trigone), granuloma (left labial mucosa), and various tissues from neck dissections, including lymph nodes, fat, and possibly muscle. The near total glossectomy specimen shows a poorly defined ulcerating white mass, likely representing the primary tumor.

Stage: Not provided, but based on the description of the near total glossectomy with a 6.5 x 3.5 x 4.5 cm tumor crossing the midline, it is likely to be a late-stage cancer (T4).

Grade: Not provided, but the presence of focal atypical epithelial nests in the right retromolar trigone specimen suggests high-grade dysplasia or carcinoma in situ.

Behavior: Malignant behavior is suspected based on the description of the near total glossectomy and the presence of a poorly defined ulcerating white mass, as well as atypical epithelial nests in the right retromolar trigone specimen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Stage: pT3 (the tumor is a pT3 based on tumor size and lack of bone invasion, as stated in the addendum comment)

Behavior: Malignant (squamous cell carcinoma is an invasive malignancy)
Justification: The description of the left partial maxillectomy specimen indicates a squamous cell carcinoma with a size of 4.5 cm, which meets the criteria for a pT3 stage. The absence of bone invasion supports this staging. Additionally, the workup includes multiple sections of the mass and surrounding tissues, including the maxillary bone following decalcification, indicating a malignant process.

The sample consists of a fragment of soft tissue measuring 3.5 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm. Microscopic examination reveals features consistent with a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST), WHO Grade III. No specific sites of origin are identified, but the lesion is abutting and possibly arising from a nerve bundle. There is no evidence of residual schwannoma or neurofibroma within this sample. The specimen shows focal areas of tumor necrosis. Mitotic activity is brisk (>10 mitoses/10 high power fields). Surgical margins are widely involved by the tumor. No lymphovascular invasion is identified.
