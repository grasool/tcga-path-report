Focally, in one residual bronchus , an area of in \nsitu adenocarcinoma is identified. In addition , some subpleural \nfibrosis is present suggesting that this is a primary adenocarcinoma \nas opposed to a metastatic adenocarcinoma. A panel of \nimmunohistochemical stains is performed including CK7, CK20, CDX2, \nand TTF1 (with appropriate positive and negative controls). The \nneoplastic cells are strongly positive for CK7. The neoplastic \ncells demonstrate some scattered focal positive stain for CK20. The \nneoplastic cells demonstrate focal weakly positive staining TTF1. \nIn addition, the neoplastic cells demonstrate a rare focal positive \nstaining cell for CDX2. \nThis demonstrates a well differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma. \nThe subpleural fibrosis would suggest this represents a primary lung \nneoplasm, however, the immunohistochemical stains are equivocal and \ntherefore the possibility of a metastatic lesion cannot be fully \nexcluded on histologic grounds alone.

Below the hilum there is a finn tumour which measures 68 x 65 mm in \nmaximal dimension and has a finn sclerotic cut surface. Towards the superior aspect of this there is a \nfinn node which is adherent to the medial aspect of the tumour. Further enlarged nodes are present \nsurrounding the inferior aspect of the bronchial resection margin and pulmonary artery. The tumour \nabuts the pleural surface on this medial aspect but appears clear of the lateral aspect by approximately \n10 mm. On sectioning there are areas of necrosis and the tumour has a sclerotic cut face. Elsewhere \nthere is apical scarring. Distal to the tumour there is evidence of obstructive pneumonitis and in the \nbasal aspect of the lung there is a finn grey nodule.

[Blocked in toto, SA] \nMICROSCOPIC \nI: Sections show a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Patchy necrosis is present. \nVascular invasion is presenl but the pulmonary artery is clear of malignancy. No pleural, lymphatic or \nperineura l invasion is identified. The bronchial resection margin is clear of malignancy and shows no \nevidence of squamous metaplasia or dysplasia. Obstructive pneumonitis is confinned adjacent to the \ntumour. A way from the tumour there are at least three further distinct lesions. The first is the nodule \nnoted in the lower zone which comprises granulomatous inflammation including numerous giant cells \nof Langhans type with surround ing lymphocytic infiltration and fibrosis. A few tiny foci of necrosis \nare present within this nodule. There are [wo further foci of granulomatous inflammation with \nextensive central necrotic debris surrounded by foamy macrophag es and fibrosis. These appear to be \ncentred on bronchi. No organisms are identified in any of these lesions with Grocott or ZN stains. \nHowever the appearances are highly suspicious for infection, and I note that atypical Mycobacteria \nhave been found previously in sputum. The peribronchial lymph nodes are confmned to contain \nmetastatic squamous cell carcinoma, and they also have foci of fibrosis and dystrophic calcification, \nbut they show no evidence of granulomatous inflamma tion. \n2: Sections of the pulmonary artery show no evidence of malignancy . \n3: Sections of the lymph node show multiple silicotic nodules together with extensive sheets of \npigmented macrophages but there is no evidence of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma. \n4: Sections show lymph nodes with a follicular hyperplasia, sinus histiocytosis and aggregates of \npigmented macrophages.

The neoplastic cells have prominent \nnucleoli, and do not have the cytologic appearance of small \ncell carcinoma, grade II neuroendocrine carcinoma (atypical \ncarcinoid) or large cell neuroendocrine carCinoma. \nImmunohistochemical stains are performed. The neoplasm \nstains positively for cytokeratin CK7 as well as forTTF-1. \nThe neoplasm is negative for CK20, high molecular weight \nkeratin SK and p63. The findings support the diagnosis of .-\n_gdenocarcinoma of lung primary. There is weak staining for \nsynaptophysin. It 1s felt 1n that this is an example of \nnon-neuroendocrine carcinoma {adenocarcinoma) that shows \npositive staining for synaptophysin, and that it should not \nresult in classification of a neuroendocrine tumor. \nCurrent NCCN practice guidelines recommend determination of \nEGFR and KRAS mutation status in adenocarcinoma of lung to \nhelp select patients for Tyrosine-Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) \ntherapy. EGFR-activating mutations have been shown to be \nsignificantly associated with response to TKis and KRAS \nmutations are associated with TKI resistance. They are \nmutually exclusive in NSCLC. Additionally, recent data show \nthat ALK (Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase) gene rearrangements in \nadenocarcinoma of lung are associated with resistance to \nTKis and have favorable response rates to Crizotinib, the \nALK inhibitor agent currently in clinical trials. Mutation \nanalysis for KRAS and EGFR-TK domain and ALK gene \nrearrangement by FISH is available as the Lung Cancer \nMutation Panel. Testing may be performed on \nparaffin-embedded tissue from the primary or metastatic \ntumor or pleural fluid cell block.

Received fresh in a container labeled \"right upper \nlobe\" is a 296 gm, 17.8 x 11.8 x 4 em, lung lobe compatible \nwith right upper lobe. In the hilar region there is an 0.8 em long \nand 1.5 em in diameter bronchial stump which is grossly \nunremarkable. The vessels at the margin are also grossly \nunremarkable. There are some tan-gray lymph nodes up to 1.2 em in \ngreatest dimension in the hilar region. The pleural surface is \npink-purple with some anthracotic pigment deposition. There .is some \nretraction of the pleural surface. The specimen is sectioned, and \nthere is a 2.6 x 2 x 1.8 em rubbery tan-white mass underlying the \narea with pleural retraction1 with the mass suggestive of invading \nthe pleura. Approximately 2 em from this mass is a separate 4 x 3.5 \nx 3.1 ern rubbery tan-white mass. This mass approaches at least near \nto the pleural surface. The larger lesion has yellow-orange \ndiscoloration surrounding it, suggestive of surrounding pneumonia. \nThe remainder of the parenchyma is spongy and red-purple without \naddi tiona! lesions. RS-13, follmving fixation. \nBLOCK SUt~1ARY: Al -bronchial margini A2 -vascular margin; A3-A5 -\nfirst lesion described; A6-A9 -larger lesioni AlO -parenchyma \nsurrounding larger lesioni All-random lungi Al2 -two hilar lymph \nnodes; A13 -bisected hilar lymph node. \nGROSS DESCRIPTION \nB. Received fresh in a container labeled \"level 11\" are \ntwo pieces of soft red-gray tissue, 0.7 em in greatest \naggregate dimension. AS-1, following fixation. \nC. Received fresh in a container labeled \"2R\" are four \npieces of soft red-gray tissue, 3 em in greatest aggregate \ndimension. AS-2, following fixation. \nD. Received fresh in a container labeled \"4R\" are multiple \nsimilar fragments of tissue, in aggregate 2.7 x 1 x 0.5 em. \nAS-3, following fixation. \nE. Received fresh in a container labeled \"level 7\" is a \nsimilar portion of tissue, 1.5 em in greatest dimension. \nAS-2, following fixation. \nMICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION \nThe follm'ling template surrunarizes the findings in this \ncase: \nHistologic type: Both of the mass lesions consist of poorly \ndifferentiated non-small cell carcinoma. There are areas that it is \nfavored have squamous differentiation, as well as less frequent \nfoci suggestive of glandular differentiation (adenocarcinoma). \nAlthough not entirely identical, the two lesions look similar. \nHistologic grade: Poorly differentiated \nPrimary tumor (pT): These two lesions are grossly 2.6 em and 4 em \nin greatest dimension. The 2.6 em in diameter lesion has visceral \n pleural invasion, with the larger lesion extending very \nperipherally but without definite visceral pleural invasion. \nAlthough it is difficult to definitely distinguish between \nsynchronous primaries and the two masses being part of the same \nprocess, given the similarities in appearance, based on the new \nguidelines, two nodules of similar histology in the same lobe \nMICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION \nwould be classified as pT3, Clinical correlation is recommended. \nMargins of resection: The bronchial and vascular resection margins \nare negative. \nDirect extension of tumor: Visceral pleural extension for the 2.6 \nem in diameter lesion, no direct extension identified for the larger \nlesion. \nVascular invasion: Not definitively identified. \nRegional lymph nodes (pN): pNl. There is metastatic carcinoma in \none of three hilar lymph nodes in part A. The separately submitted \nlymph nodes in parts B, c, D, and E are negative for malignancy. \nDistant metastasis {pM} : pMX \nOther findings: There are inflammatory changes surrounding the \ntumors, with focally prominent pneumonia surrounding the larger \nlesion. \nNote: This case has been reviewed in Intradepartmental consultation \nwith all reviewers interpreting the two mass lesions as similar in \nappearance. \n3,4x3,5 \nDIAGNOSIS \nA.

The analytical sensitivity of\nthe assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low\npercentage of cells may not be detected.\nThis test is validated for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and\ncodon 13 mutations in fresh, frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin\nembedded tissue. In particular the test performance has been\nestablished in samples of colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung\ncarcinoma which harbor these mutations, although several other\ntissues are also known to harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of\npancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix, etc.).\nMETHOD/LIMITATIONS:\nTissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is\nselected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample ,quantified\nand amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to\nexon 2 of the KRAS gene .PCR products are subjected to single\nnucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;\nprimer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel\nelectrophoresis and fluorescence detection .False positive or\nnegative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants\nor somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.\nREFERENCES:\nNSCLC\nMascaux C, lannino N, et al.

Electronically signed by:\nDate:\nAddendum #1 performed by\nADDENDUM #2:\nINTEGRATED ONCOLOGY\nEGFR Mutation Analysis\nReferring Physician: .\nBody Site: Lung\nClinical Data :Adenocarcinoma\nRESULTS: No mutation detected.\nINTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified in the sample provided\nfor analysis .Fewer than 5% of non -small cell lung carcinoma\npatients without identifiable mutations are reported to be\nresponsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies. COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more tumor cellularity is optimal\nfor this mutation analysis .The sample submitted showed 80% tumor\ncellularity upon pathologist review.\nA frequently occurring sequence change 2361 G>A (Q787Q) was\nidentified. This polymorphism is known not to have clinical\nsignificance.\nMutations in the tyrosine domain of the epidermal growth factor\nreceptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with differential\nresponsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)\ntherapies. The objective response rate among patients with a\nsensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%.\nThis assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain;\nbased on the current literature, most mutations in non -small-cell\nlung carcinoma (NSCLC) are expected to occur in these exons.\nMutations present in less than 10-20% of extracted DNA may not be\ndetected by this method. Mutation status in a sample may change\nduring tumor progression or the course of therapy; therefore, this\nresult cannot be used to infer the presence or absence of a mutation\nin another sample or sub -sample obtained from this tumor.\nThis test is validated for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The\nclinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types\nis unknown.\nMETHOD/LIMITATION:\nTissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is\nselected for analysis .DNA is isolated from the samples, quantified\nand amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to\nexons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by\nbi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary gel\nelectrophoresis and fluorescence detection .False positive or\nnegative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants\nor somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.\nREFERENCES:\n1.Azzoli CG, et al, J.

C34.3 M 8255/3 G3.  \nComment/supplementary remark:   \nWithin the main tumor and the lymph node metastases, which are found within the lung in the \nparabronchial region, at the hilus and in sample 5, the large-cell solid tumor component, which has a partly clear -cell character, is predominant. Especially in the area of the main \ntumor margin and the surrounding area the carcinoma shows glandular tubulopapillary and bronchioloalveolar differentiation. No maturation pattern of squamous epithelium is evident on conventional histology (immunohistochemical analysis will follow to provide as definitive confirmation as possible of the bronchopulmonary origin of the tumor and thus exclusion of a late metastatic spread of the reported breast carcinoma). The RX category is explained by the fact that the tumor infiltrating the pleura and disseminated there extends as far as the pleural surface and, with the detection of carcinoma cells in the pleural effusions, the possibility cannot be excluded that some of them remained there. The central bronchus resection line and the resection margins of the large pulmonary vessels and the resection pr eparation of parietal \npleura itself, as registered under 4., are tumor- free \n  Result of immunohistochemical analysis: a major part of the tumor cells with double expression of low and high molecular weight keratins (M903 and 902). In the glandular differen tiation component, tumor cell nuclei are positive TTF1.  \n The immune profile confirms the diagnosis of an adenocarcinoma of the lung of mixed differentiation.  \n  \n",

However, based on the procedures performed (bronchoscopy and thoracoscopy), it could be a lung cancer or another type of lung mass.\n\nStage: The stage is not provided in the text, as it would require additional information such as the size of the mass and whether it has spread to nearby lymph nodes or other organs.\n\nGrade: The grade is also not provided in the given text. Grade refers to how abnormal the cancer cells look under a microscope and how quickly the cancer is likely to grow and spread.\n\nBehavior: The behavior of the mass cannot be determined without more information, such as whether it is benign or malignant.\n\nJustification for the choices: The site, laterality, stage, grade, and behavior are not explicitly provided in the text, and the histology can only be inferred based on the procedures performed.

Part A is submitted fresh for tissue procurement, \n             labeled \"lingula\".  It consists of an elongated portion of \n    lung tissue, measuring 18 x 4 x 2 cm. maximally.  It has been \n    amputated along an entire edge, which has steel clips and paper tape \n    present.  There is an area of pleural puckering opposite the tape, \n    which has drawn the pleura into a stellate- like area, with a \n    palpable mass deep to that.  The pleura is focally torn along \n    another portion of the specimen.  Black ink is applied over the area \n    of the scar and then the specimen is serially sectioned.  This \n    reveals the presence of a nodular tumor mass immediately beneath the \n    pleura, in the region of the above- mentioned scar.  That tumor mass \n    measures maximally 2 x 1.5 x 1.3 cm.  Sections through the remaining \n    pulmonary parenchyma reveal a consolidated bloody red tissue, \n    without other focal nodules present.  There is some adherent fat \n    present on the pleural surface.  Representative tumor and normal \n    ions are submitted for tissue procurement, per request of \n      Sections after fixation. \n      Part B is submitted fresh, labeled \"Level 10 lymph \n             node\".

Collection \nE. EML41ALK rearrangement NOT identified (see In Situ Procedure). \nNote: \nKRAS codon 12/13 mutations are found in approximately 10-30% lung adenoyarclnomas and associated with history of \nsmoking, The presence of KRAS mutation leads to resistance to EGFR ~ therapies (1). EGFR exon 19 and 21 \nmutations are present in about 10% of  and up to 40% in th..-,opulation, common in and \nassociated \nwith the clinical response to treatment with EGFR inhibitors (2). These mutations are mutually exciusive and \ntheir presence may have prognostic andlor therapeutic implications (3,4). Clinical studies show high EGFR gene copy \nnumber by FISH analysis (amplification) to be associated with favorable clinical benefit (clinical response, stable disease, \ntime to progression, and survival) In patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase \ninhibitors. \nApproximately 3% of lung adenocarcinomas within the Asian population have an interstitial deletion and inversion in \nchromosome 2p resulting in the EML4IALK fusion gene (ALK+) which is sensitive to AlK inhibitors (5,6). The prevalence \nof this abnormality in the Western population is stili unknown, Detection of this abnormality is critical for identifying \npatients eligible for therapies that target ALK enzymatic activity. EML41ALK rearrangements are mutually exclusive with \nKRAS and EGFR mutations. \nFINAL DIAGNOSIS: \nSUMMARY STATEMENT \nThe posterior segmentectomy demonstrates a 2.5 cm poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma associated with \nangiolymphatic and parietal pleural invasion. Metastatic adenocarcinoma is present in posterior and apical segment \nlevel 11, level 10 and level 5 lymph nodes. Surgical resection margins are free of tumor.

C34.2 M8255/3.  \nComment/supplementary remark:   \nThe tumor classification as adenocarcinoma of the lung showing a predominantl y \ntubulopapillary structural pattern still requires confirmation by appropriate \nimmunohistochemical analysis. The classification of the second small tumor focus as a (hematogenous) metastasis that \u2013 despite a certain difference in histoarchitecture and cel l \nmorphology in places \u2013 is based on the structure of the focus, which is lacking the fibrous remodeling or cicatricial zone here that is characteristic of a primary peripheral bronchopulmonary carcinoma. Vascular invasion can be seen in the intratumoral, thick -walled \npulmonary vessels of the larger tumor, where there is tumor spread with endobronchial occlusion in a subsegmental branch of the bronchus. The R1 classification is explained by the observation that the tumor glands invading the pleura extend as far as the outer surface of the pleura in places and the tumor cells thus remain in the pleural space.    Result of immunohistochemical analysis (both tumor foci)  \nCK7 positive throughout, CK20 negative. TTF1.positive (in the smaller focus more than in the larger one), only isolated tumor cells with delicate cell membrane staining for surfactant protein B.  This not only confirms that it is an adenocarcinoma of the lung and, but also supports the view that the smaller focus represents the metastasis of the larger focus  \nseen in 1.) and classified as primary tumor.  \n",

The report describes a tumor in the right upper lobe, which was identified as squamous cell carcinoma, keratinizing type, and moderately differentiated (G2). The stage was determined to be pT2aN0MX based on the size of the tumor (>3 em but <= 5 em), the absence of regional lymph node metastasis, and the inability to assess distant metastasis.

No preoperative tissue diagnosis . \nMACROSCOPIC \nOne specimen submitted. \nThe specimen is labelled 'left upper lobe wedge resection' and consists of a wedge oflung tissue, 130 x \n70 x 30 mm. The specimen bears a line of staples 110 mm in length. Protruding from one aspect of \nthe pleural surface is a palpable mass. The pleura is free and mobile over the mass. 35 mm away from \nthis lesion is a firm pleural plaque, 30 mm in diameter. Elsewhere the pleura shows some irregular \ngrey and white discolouration. Serial slicing reveals a well defined yellowish white tumour mass, 25 \nmm in greatest diameter, approximately 2 mm deep to the pleura. The cut surface shows small areas of \nyellowish necrosis. The tumour is at least 25 mm clear of the stapled surgical margin. No other lesions \nare identified. The uninvolved lung shows severe emphysema. The mass lesion has been sampled for \nMicrobiology and for  [IA-IB tumour with overlying pleura; lC-ID pleural _iir decalcification; IE-IF uninvolved lung parenchyma.] \nMICROSCOPY \nSections reveal a peripherally located moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma demonstrating \npredominantly acinar and focal solid architecture. The tumour is positive for CK7 and TTFI and \nnegative for CK20. Zones of geographic necrosis are evident within the confines of the tumour. The \ntumour does not involve the pleura and is macroscopically clear of the intraparenchyma l stapled \nmargin. No lymphatic or vascular invasion is identified and no perineural permeation by tumour is \nseen.

Part one is labeled 'right middle lobe nodule'. It consists of a\nwedge shaped portion of lung measuring 11 x 5 x 2 cm. There is a\nstaple line identified on the specimen, measuring 10 cm in length.\nThere is a cut identified on the specimen measuring 1.5 cm in\nlength. On further sectioning there is a gray white ill defined area\nmeasuring 1.1 x 1 cm is identified. This area is 0.3 cm from the\nstaple line and 0.4 cm from the pleural surface. The staple line is\ninked blue. Further sectioning of the lung reveals spongy tan maroon\nparenchyma. One portion from the ill defined area is submitted for\nfrozen section analysis. Representative sections are submitted.\n2. Part two is labeled 'station #9 lymph node'. It consists of a\nsingle lymph node measuring 2.4 x 1.5 x 1 cm. The cut surface is\ngrey-black. Entirely submitted in one cassette.\n3. Part three is labeled 'station #10 lymph node'. It consists of\nmultiple irregular fragments of grey-black lymph nodes measuring 1.5\nx 0.8 x 0.5 cm in aggregate. Entirely submitted in one cassette.\n4. Part four is labeled 'completion of right middle lobectomy'. It\nconsists of a lobe of lung measuring 10.5 x 5.5 x 2 cm and weighing\n38 grams. Two staple lines, measuring 8 cm and 6 cm in length are\nnoted. The bronchial and vascular margins are identified. The\nserosal surface is grey-purple and shows a subpleural grey-black\nnodule measuring 0.9 x 0.8 cm. Sectioning reveals an unremarkable red beefy lung parenchyma. The subpleural nodule likely represents\nthe lymph node. No discrete mass lesions are noted. Representative\nsections are submitted.\n5. Part five is labeled 'station #4 lymph node'.

The pathologist whose\nsignature appears below reviewed the original pathology report,\nexamined candidate H&E slides, and selected block 1 A appropriate to\nthe specifications of the ordered molecular analysis. xl H&E and x9\nunstained slides were prepared and forwarded to\nwhere the subject molecular test will be performed. An\naddendum report will be issued when the results.of this molecular\ntest are available.\nAddendum #1performed by\nADDENDUM #2:\nMOLECULAR ONCOLOGY\nKRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS\nReferring Physician\nBody Site :Right middle lobe of lung\nSpecimen Type: Slides\nClinical Data :Adenocarcinoma\nRESULTS: Wild-type gene.\nINTERPRETATION:\nNo mutations were identified at codons 12 and 13 of the KRAS gene.\nCOMMENT:\nMutations in the KRAS gene are reported to be associated with poor prognosis ,and resistance to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor\ntherapies in patients with non -small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). KRAS\nmutations occur in 15-30% of NSCLC patients and are strongly\nassociated with adenocarcinoma and smoking history.\nThis assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;\nbased on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are\nexpected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of\nthe assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low\npercentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated\nfor use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and codon 13 mutations in\nfresh, frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue. In\nparticular the test performance has been established in samples of\ncolorectal cancer and non-small cell lung carcinoma which harbor\nthese mutations, although several other tissues are also known to\nharbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of pancreas, bile duct, ovary,\nappendix, etc.).\nAnalysis of EGFR mutation or gene amplification status may provide\nadditional information regarding this patient's probability of\nresponse to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies, if\nclinically indicated. See references.\nMETHOD/LIMITATION:\nTissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is\nselected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified\nand amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to\nexon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single\nnucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;\nprimer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel\nelectrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or\nnegative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants\nor somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.\nREFERENCES:\nNSCLC\nMascaux C, lannino N, et al.

COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more tumor cellularity is optimal\nfor this mutation analysis. The sample submitted showed 70% tumor\ncellularity upon pathologist review.\nA frequently occurring sequence change 2361>GA (Q787Q) was\nidentified .This polymorphism is known not to have clinical\nsignificance.\nMutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth\nfactor receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with\ndifferential responsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase\ninhibitor (TKI) therapies. The objective response rate among\npatients with a sensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%.\nThis assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain;\nbased on the current literature ,most mutations in non -small-cell\nlung carcinoma (NSCLC) are expected to occur in these exons.\nMutations present in less than 10-20 %of extracted DNA may not be\ndetected by this method .Mutation status in a sample may change\nduring tumor progression or the course of therapy; therefore, this\nresult cannot be used to infer the presence or absence of a mutation\nin another sample or sub-sample obtained from this tumor.\nThis test is validated for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The\nclinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types\nis unknown.\nMETHOD:\nTissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is\nselected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified\nand amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to\nexons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by\nbi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary gel\nelectrophoresis and fluorescence detection.

When a rearrangement involving ALK is\npresent, either inversion or translocation, one of the two fusion\nsignals separates as one red and one green signal. In this\nspecimen, separated signals were present in 0% of the nuclei scored.\nThis result is within the normal limits.\nCOMMENTS: Three to four copies of ALK were observed in 26.0% of\ncells. This gain of intact ALK fusion hybridization signals\nrepresents an aneuploid population with extra copies of chromosome\n2/2p ALK region .Additional copies of ALK are not uncommon in\nNSCLCs, although the significance of extra copies of the ALK gene in\nlung carcinoma is unclear at this time (Salido M. et al.

Fibrinous chronic granulating and fibrosing visceral (sample 1.)) \nand parietal pleuritis (sample 2.)). Uncharacteristic chronic, predominantly interstitial inflammation and fibrosis \nassociated with focal fibrous and small honeycomb-like parenchyma remodeling along the ventrobasalmargin \nof 88.

Left lung submitted fresh for tissue procurement \n             labelled \"left lung\" is an intact lung with two lobes \n    weighing 442 grams.  There is a suture line present at the \n    amputation point of the main left bronchus, the left main pulmonary \n    artery and main left pulmonary vein.  The pleural surface of the \n    lung is intact with a finely stippled anthracotic pigment present. \n    No obvious areas of puckering of the pleura or umbilication are \n    evident.  Several small possible peribronchial lymph nodes are \n    present adjacent to the bronchial stump.  There is a mass that is \n    palpable in the interlobar fissure.  This appears to be below the \n    surface of the lung.  Sections are placed through the mass and this \n    reveals a large tumor mass which is immediately inferior to the main \n    bronchus.  The tumor mass measures maximally 6 x 5 x 4 cm.  It \n    arises approximately 1 cm below the bronchial cuff margin that \n    grossly does not appear to be involved by tumor.  There does appear \n    to be at least one lymph node which is partially involved by tumor \n    adjacent the bronchus.  Portions of the t ormal lung are \n    submitted for procurement per request of   Further \n    sectioning of the lung reveals a second t present deep to \n    the pleural surface of the lower lobe.  This pleural mass as central \n    necrosis and measures maximally 3 x 2 x 1.5 cm.  It has the same \n    fleshy  tan- white gritty cut surface as does the main tumor mass. \n    The upper lobe does not appear to have any discrete nodules.  It is \n    crepitant gray- tan tissue without focal nodularity.  Sections after \n    fixation. \n    BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 - bronchial margin; 2 - vascular margin; 3 - \n    pleural margin of the main dominant tumor mass; 4- 7 - dominant tumor \n    mass; 8-10 - secondary smaller tumor including pleural surface; 11 - \n    random left upper lobe; 12 - random left lower lobe; 13- 14 - \n    bronchial lymph nodes. \n \n     \n \nMICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION \n             Microscopic sections of both lesions present in the left \n             lung have a similar histologic appearance.  Both are \n    moderate to poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas with cells \n    exhibiting prominent eosinophilic cytoplasm.  It is not clear from \n    the histology if this represents two separate primary tumors or an \n    intrapulmonary metastasis from the main lung tumor.  Results of the \n    evaluation of the lung are summarized in the following template: \n \n    Histologic type:  Adenocarcinoma. \n    Histologic grade:  Moderate to poorly differentiated. \n    Primary tumor (pT):  Two lesions are present.  The larger lesion \n    measures 6 x 5 x 4 cm., the smaller lesion 3 x 2 x 1.5 cm. (pT2). \n    Margins of resection:  Bronchial and vascular margins of resection \n    are free of tumor.  Visceral pleural surface free of tumor. \n    Direct extension of tumor:  Absent. \n    Venous (large vessel) invasion:  Negative. \n    Arterial (large vessel) invasion:  Negative. \n    Lymphatic (small vessel) invasion:  Negative. \n    Regional lymph nodes (pN):  Two of six bronchial lymph nodes contain \n    metastatic adenocarcinoma (2/6).  All mediastinal lymph nodes are \n       negative (pN1). \n    Distant metastasis (pM):  Cannot be assessed (pMX). \n \n    5, 3x6, 14x2 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \nDIAGNOSIS \n    A.

Hilar LN (station 10) right: 2.5 em fatty specimen with 2 nodes, 2.5 and 1.2 em, section surface of larger \ngrayish-black and of smaller pale reddish node with 5 mm whitish focus. \n1.) Right middle lobe: inflated, frxed bilobectomy preparation measuring 18 x 16 em, up to 17 em high. Central \nbronchus resection plane located I em proximal to the division into the lobe bronchi. At the hilus two black \nnodes, 1.2 em and 0.9 em in size. Dorsal to the intermediate bronchus a staple suture line runs 7.5 em in a \ncranial direction to the apex of the lower lobe, and a second staple suture line mns 10 em from the hilus along \nthe cranial margin of the middle lobe. Lateral pleura over S4 shows a star-shaped area of retraction measuring \n2.5 em, with a pale brown discoloration in the marginal region, under this a tumor, max. 6.5 em in size, with a \npolycyclic demarcation, obstructing the middle lobe bronchus in the proximal sections and extending to within \n1.5 em of the bronchus resection margin. Spread to the pleura in the area of its retraction, section surfaces pale \nbrown to gray, partly with blackish pigmentation. Mucosa in the region of the ostium of the middle lobe \nbronchus and the adjoining intermediate bronchus extending irregularly to the resection margin. Lung \nparenchyma of remaining middle lobe and lower lobe inconspicuous. \n3.) Bronchial sleeve: 2 em segment of bronchus with 2 em resection margin to the main bronchus (line marked) \nand 1.1 em resection margin tot he upper lobe bronchus. Distal end closed by metal staple suture. \n4.) Upper and middle lobes: two 2 em irregular black nodes or node parts. \n5.) Lobar LN (station 12) right: I em node. \n6.) Hilar LN (station 10) right: 8 mm node with sunounding tissue. \n7.) Pulmonary ligament LN (station 9) right: three node between 0.5 and I em with surrounding tissue \n8.)

Resection margin to main bronchus tangential, resection margin to upper lobe bronchus tangential, cross\u00ad\nsection close to distal resection margin, \n4.)-7.) All material (in 4. -6. halved in each case), \n15 blocks, partly Elastica-van Gieson, PAS, diastase-PAS. \n Microscopy \nRe 1.) Immediate intraoperative evaluation ): metastasis of squamous cell carcinoma. \nAfter paraffin embedding. \nLymph node sections with extensive infiltration by atypical epithelia arranged in differing sizes of partly \nbranched and vaguely epidennoid or concentrically layered solid structures. Moderately wide to wide, pale to \nmoderately eosinophilic cytoplasm. Focally recognizable intercellular bridges. Nuclei round to oval, partly with \nsomewhat inegular contours, mostly moderately, but focally also markedly anisomorphic, with enlarged \nchromatin, differing sizes of nucleoli and numerous mitoses. Surrounding desmoplastic stroma. Small focal \ninclusion of necrosis. \nRe 2.) Immediate intraoperative evaluation ): squamous cell dysplasia up to severity of a squamous \ncell carcinoma in situ with spread to bronchial glands, no evidence of invasive growth rapid sections. \nAfter paraffin embedding. \nTumor made up of atypical epithelia described in 1.). Focal dyskeratoses or vague pearly bead formation. \nIsolated nuclei also deformed. Multifocal necroses of differing extent. Middle lobe bronchus segmentally \nobstructed by the tumor and in large pa1ts destroyed, here continuous infiltration of para bronchial lymph nodes. \nSpread to the visceral pleura, which is markedly enlarged by fibrosis in parts, but not unequivocally infiltrated. \nIn many places invasion of small blood vessels in the tumor and tumor margin. Proximal to the tumor \nobstruction in the middle lobe bronchus and also at the bronchus resection margin partial replacement of the \nrespiratory epithelium by enlarged atypical squamous epithelium extending to the secretory ducts and bronchial \nglands with the squamous disorder mostly reaching well into the upper third or to the surface. Nuclei irregularly \narranged, in most cases slightly to moderately anisomorphic, but with foci of relatively marked anisomorphism, \nand formation here and there of keratin lamellae and pearly beads. Vessel resection margins and hilar lymph \nnodes tumor-free. In S5 incompletely inflated alveolar lung tissue in parts with relatively extensive intraalveolar \nerythrocyte extravasates. \nOtherwise in many places the alveolar lumina and partly also the lumina of bronchioles are occupied with \nmoderately dense macrophages, some transformed into foam cells, some pale brown and with frne granular \nblackish pigmentation. In multifocal parabronchial vessels and in interlobular septa lymph follicles and small \npatches of relatively dense lymphomonocytic infiltrates. In SIO mostly only a few intraalveolar macrophages. \nRe 3.) Immediate intraoperative evaluation (  resection margin to main bronchus + upper lobe \nbronchus in each case tumor-free and free of dysplastic epithelial lesions. \nAfter paraffin embedding: \nBronchial sections with focal replacement of respiratory epithelium by immature squamous epithelium at the \nmargin to the main and upper lobe bronchus. Stroma with increase in elastic fibers. To some extent somewhat \nprominent seromucous glands. Strands of typical hyaline cartilage. Close to the distal resection margin only \nsections of atypical squamous epithelium preserved or registered at the surface as described under 2.), here \nlikewise focal spread in glandular ducts. \nRe 4.) -7.) Lymph nodes with intact basic structure, inconspicuous lymphatic cell content with formation of \nactivated follicles and slight to moderate deposits of blackish granular pigment and some small anisotropic \nparticles within macrophages. \nEVALUATION \nPrimary diagnosis/diagnoses: relatively large, central to peripheral bronchopuhnonary, histologically \nmoderately differentiated, large-cell, slightly keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma of the middle lobe. \nTNM classification pT2 pNJ. VI RO, stage IIB. \nC 34.2 M 8070/3 \nSecondary diagnosis/diagnoses: slight chronic retention pneumonia peripheral to the tumor in S5. Lymph \nnodes with uncharacteristic reactive lesions and anthracotic pigment deposits (samples 2.) and 4.)-7.)). \nRemark/addendum: the tumor shows obliterative segmental growth in the middle lobe bronchus and has \nspread to the mucosal surface right to the central bronchus resection line of sample 2.) and to the distal sections \nof repeat bronchial resection material in sample 3.). The resection margin tot he main and upper lobe bronchus \nof sample 3.) is free of dysplastic epithelial changes. Lymph node metastases are seen in sample 1.) and \nparabronchially in sample 2. ). The other lymph nodes removed and the vessel resection margins of the main \npreparation are tumor-free. An unequivocal infiltration of the visceral pleura cannot be demonstrated. \n",

But in view of the presentation of the tumor and the partial bronchioloalveolar differentiation, the interpretation can be just as easily be supported or perhaps even f avored \nthat this is a primary multifocal tumor manifestation. This would correspond to pT2(m). The stage grouping IIIB thus competes with IIB. The main tumor mass lies in segments 6 and 9 of the resected right lower lobe.

It consists of one grossly identifiable fragment\nof fleshy hemorrhagic tissue consistent with lung. A long black\nsuture which does not designate anything in particular is attached to\nthe specimen. The specimen weighs 66 grams and measures 10 x 6.5 x 4\ncm.A palpable massis identified in the parenchyma. The overlying\npleura is inked with black ink. Serially sectioning the lung reveals\na 2.5 cm tumor massthat is white tan and firm around the edges and\nslightly necrotic and hemorrhagic in the center. Tumor and normal\nlung are collected for the tumor bank and for lab for\nfurther studies. A tied off vessel is grossly identified. This\nvessel is sampled and assumed to be a vascular margin. A long\nparenchymal staple margin is grossly identified in the specimen in the\nshape of a Y. This margin measures 9 cm at its longest aspect and\nthere is also an arm of the staple margin that measures 4.2 cm. The\ntumormass appears to grossly abut the pleura. However, the tumor\nmassis located approximately 1.6 cm from the closest staple margin.\nThis staple margin is shaved and submitted in its entirety. The shave\nsuture margin is submitted in cassettes B-D.Sections are taken of\nthe tumor mass.Sectioning through the remainder of the lung\nparenchyma does not reveal any other mass lesions. Sections of normal\nlung are submitted. Additionally received with the specimen is a small\nfragment of rib. This rib measures 2.1 x 1.4 x 0.3 cm.

Suspected occupational exposure \nto asbestos. \nREPORT ON FINDINGS \nMacroscopy \n1.) Inflated, fixed right lung measuring 12 x 11 em at the base and np to 25 em in length, central bronchus \nresection plane located 1.2 em proximal to the bifurcation of the upper lobe bronchus. Upper pleural fissure \nextensively obliterated in dorsal third, over segment 6 and adjacent sections of S2 an 8.5 x 6 em area of parietal \npleura is extensively adhesive. At the hilus are six partly lesioned mobile grayish-black nodes between 1.1 and \n2 em in size, lower lobe bronchus and proximal sections oflower lobe segmental bronchi largely obstructed by \na central moderately solid, pale brownish, predominantly endobronchial tumor, max. 4.8 em in size, in the lower \nlobe. Involvement of several grayish-black pigmented nodes up to 1.4 em in size by the tumor. Central blood \nvessels partly narrowed by the tumor. Tumor spread across the pleural fissure questionably into the upper lobe. \nSleeve-like spread along the lower lobe bronchus, with apparent involvement of a 2.2 em grayish-black node \nextending right up to the hilar resection surface. Intermediate and peripheral lower lobe bronchial branches are \nmarkedly dilated and filled with thick mucus. Parenchyma in segment 6 below the pleural adhesion is an \nindurated and pale brownish-yellow area of about 3.5 em with unclear demarcation, medial parenchyma in \nsegment 3 and apical parenchyma in segment I rarefied with lacunae or lacuna systems of up to 0.5 em. Pleura \nover segment I shows whitish discoloration in several, partly striated areas of up to 5 em, underlying \nparenchyma here shows an indurated and grayish-white seam about 0.3 em thick. \n2.) Hilar LN (station 10) right: 2.6 em lesioned node or node part, section surfaces predominantly pale brown to \nwhitish suggestive of a tumor. \n3.) Pulmonary ligament LN (station 9) right: two lesioned grayish-black nodes with some surrounding tissue, \n0.3 and 1.2 em in size. \n4.) Paraesophageal LN (station 8) right: five lesioned grayish-black nodes or node parts between 0.3 and 1.2 \nem. \n5.) Snbcarinal LN (station 7): 2 em node part with pale brown to whitish section surfaces suggestive of a tumor. \n6.) Low paratracheal LN (station 4) right: 3.5 em lesioned node with predominantly pale brown to whitish \nsection surfaces suggestive of a tumor. \n7.) Retrotracheal right: 1 em lesioned grayish-black node with some snrronnding tissne. \n8.) High paratracheal LN (station 2) right: five lesioned grayish-brown nodes or node parts between 0.1 and I \nem. \n9.) Hilar LN (station (St.! 0) left: 2.5 em lesioned node or node part, section surfaces pale brown to whitish \nsuggestive of a tumor. \n10.) Low paratracheal LN (station 4) left: 1.5 em five lesioned grayish-brown node with some surrounding \ntissue. \nII.) High paratracheal LN (station 2) left: 1.1 em lesioned grayish-brown node with some sun\u00b7ounding tissue, \nsection surfaces pale brown to whitish . \n Examined: \n1.) Tumor with rest of parenchyma+ proximal branch ofBJO, 2 sections of tumor with lower lobe bronchus+ \ninvolved nodes, 2 sections with pleural fissure to upper lobe (upper lobe portion partly color-marked), 2 \nsections main bronchus at birfurcation of lower lobe bronchus with node close to hilus (hilar resection surface \ncolor-marked), SIO intermediate, S6 at junction of S2, Sl apical, S3 medial, S2 dorsal, central bronchus \nresection plane+ resection margins of vessels, hilar nodes, \n5.), 6.)

All material (in 10. and II. halved in each case), \n23 blocks, partly Elastica-van Gieson, PAS, diastase-PAS, iron staining. \nMicroscopy \nDescription of histological and cytological findings omitted for capacity reasons. \nEVALUATION \nPrimary diagnosis/diagnoses: \nCentral bronchopulmonary, histologically poorly to moderately differentiated, partly keratinizing squamous cell \ncarcinoma of the lower lobe of the right lung with marked lymphogenic metastasization. 1NM classification \naccording to this picture pT2 pN3 VI RO, stage lllB. C 34.3; M 8070/3. G3. \nSecondary diagnosis/diagnoses: \nLargely organized pneumonic infiltrate with fibrous parenchymal remodeling in S6 and old thromboses of \nadjacent small pulmonary arteries. Flat subpleural parenchymal scar in apical Sl with slight perifocal \nemphysema. Circumscribed high-grade emphysematous stromal remodeling with formation of small cysts in \nsegments I and 3. Minimal mixed dust deposits in lung parenchyma and accumulation of alveolar siderophages \nwith possible respiratory bronchiolitis. Pleural fibrosis especially over the fibrous remodeling area in S6 with \nadhesion. Tumor-free lymph nodes with slight to moderate pigment deposits and in some cases reactive \nfollicular hyperplasia. \nRemark/addendum: \nOn the one hand, the carcinoma is spreading to central segmental bronchi of the lower lobe by completely \ninfiltrating and obliterating these, while growing into the lower lobe bronchus. On the other hand, the tumor \nextends to the pleura fissure. The angioinvasion does not affect small arteries and veins in the tumor area. Most \nof the 30 lymph nodes found are infiltrated with metastases, and they are not only detected in the tumor area \nand the hilus region, while the lymph node metastasis the near the main bronchus extends to within 0.5 mm of \nthe mediastinal resection surface, but they are also found in the lymph node areas registered under 2.), 5.), 6.) \nand 8.)-II.).

Submitted fresh for tissue procurement labeled \"left \n             upper lobe\" is a lobe of lung tissue which has been \n    amputated at the level of its principle bronchus and blood vessels. \n    The bronchial profiles that are present consists of three bronchi, \n    each approximately 8 to 9 mm across. They are grossly unremarkable. \n    Some vascular stumps are present at the point of amputation as well. \n    There is some anthracotic tissue present which  may represent some \n    hilar lymph nodes.  The visceral pleural surface of the lobe is \n    intact although there is a small area of adhesion and thickening \n    overlying an obviously large intraparenchymal tumor mass.  The \n    remainder of the parenchyma is anthracotic without focal lesion. \n    The lung was serially sectioned and this reveals a very large tumor \n    mass present in the center of the lobe which has a extensively \n    necrotic center. The tumor mass measures maximally 6 cm. across. \n    There is a rim of granular brown black tumor tissue present which \n    appears to extend to the visceral pleural surface. The center of the \n    tumor is necrotic with a creamy yellowish red appearance.  Fresh \n    tissue from normal lung is submitted for procurement as per \n    request of  Sections through the remainder of the lung \n    show no othe esions.

Overlying the apex and the lateral \naspect of the apex of the lobe is an area of pleural tethering with an underlying tumour \nmass. The remainder of the pleural surface shows no specific abnonnality apart from \nextensive carbon pigmentation. The lobar bronchus has been transected t1ush with the \nhilar soft tissue and has two lumens at this point. Small peribronchial anthracotic \nnodes are noted, none of which appears macroscopically to be involved by a tumour. \nSectioning reveals an apical tumour mass which appears to be bilobed. The combined \nmaximum size of this lesion is 32 mm. The more superior lobule is approximately 20 \nmm in diameter and shows foci of central necrosis. The more lateral and inferior \nlesion is approximately 12 mm in diameter and has a solid cream to tan cut surface. \nIn some areas the lobules appear to be separated by 2 to 3 mm of unremarkable lung \nparenchyma. Both lobules abut the overlying pleura. No other lesions are identified \non serial slicing through the parenchyma. However there is severe emphysema. [1 A, \nbronchial resection margin; 1 B, peribronchial lymph nodes; 1 C-I D longitudinal \nsections through tumour including overlying pleura and both lobules; IE, sections of \ninferolateral solid nodule with overlying pleura; 1 F, uninvolved lung parenchyma.] \n2: The second specimen is labelled 'left hilar lymph node' and consists of three \nts of focally anthracotic and fatty tissue. [BIT,2A.] \nMICROSCOPY \n1: Sections show two adenocarcinomas. The first has a predominantly acinar architecture with a small \namount of surrounding bronchioloalveolar type growth. Ext~nsive blo.od vessel invasion is noted and \nthere is possible lymphatic penneatioll : The other lesion is a papillary adenocarcinoma. The lesions \nare separated by approximately 5 inm by unremarkable lung. A third focus of adenocarcinoma with a \nbronchioloalveolar pattern is present within the random section oflung. This measures 5 mm in \ndiameter. Overlying both tumours, there is scarring of the pleura and features suspicious for invasion. \nSpecial stains will be performed. No perineural permeation is identified. The lesion is well clear of the \nbronchial resection margin. No lymph node metastases are seen. The uninvolved lung shows evidence \nof emphysema. \n2: Sections of the lymph nodes show reactive changes only. There is no evidence of malignancy. \nSUMMARY \n1-2: Left upper lobe and left hilar lymph nodes: \nA: Three foci of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma; 20 mm (acinar), 12 mm (papillary) and 5 \nmm (bronchioloalveolar) in maximal dimension. \nB: Extensive blood vessel invasion; probable lymphatic permeation but no perineural permeation \npresent. \nC: Possible pleural invasion identified; special stains being performed; clear of bronchial margin. \nD: No lymph node metastases. \nE: TINO (awaiting pleural stains) \nF: Non-neop lastic lung: Mild emphysema.  SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT \n1: Tumour invades into the visceral pleura overlying the tumour 'with the acinar architecture . It is not \ndefinitely on the pleural surface. There is no invasion of the visceral pleura by the papillary carcinoma. \nBoth tumours stain positively for CK 7 and TTF 1. CK 20 is negative.

Situated within \nthe upper part of the lobe there is a large mass present medially. The pleural \nsurface overlying this mass appears intact. On sectioning through the lobe this \nmass measures approximately 72 mm in maximum dimension. It has a \nlobulated cream appearance on cut surface and comes to within 1 mm of the \npleural surface. Tumour is present surrounding the segmental bronchus but \ndoes not appear to have eroded through ~he bronchial wall. The endobronchial \nresection margin is clear of tumour. On section ing through the remainder of \nthe lung parenchyma there is anthracosis but no evidence of emphysema and \nno further lesions are identified.

Lung, left upper lobe, wedge resection: - Adenocarcinoma  \n \n \n \n \n \n    ADDENDUM # 1 FOR MOLECULAR TE STS:  \n EGFR, KRAS and ALK (FISH) was sent on 1  for patient \nThe test is to be performed on tissue from case \ndate  The case report, slides, and blocks for the cited accession number were retrieved from archives. Th e pathologist whose \nsignature appears below reviewed the original pathology report, examined candidate H&E slides, and selected block 1C appropriate to  \nthe specifications of the ordered molecular analysis. 1 H& E and 9 unstained slides were prepared and forwarded to where the  \nsubject molecular test will be performed. An addendum report will be issued when the results of this molecular test are available.  \n Addendum #1 performed by \nElectronically signed \n ADDENDUM #2 : \n  EGFR Mutation Analysis \n  \n \n \nReferring Physician:  \n Body Site: Left upper lobe of lung  Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma  \n RESULTS: No mutation detected.  \n INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified in the sample pr ovided \nfor analysis. Fewer than 5% of non- small cell lung carcinoma  \npatients without identifiable mutations are reported to be  \nresponsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies.   COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more tumor cellularity is optimal  \nfor this mutation analysis. The sample submitted showed 80% tumor \ncellularity upon pathologist review.  A frequently occurring sequence change 2361G>A (Q787Q) was identified. This polymorphism is known not to have clinical significance.  \n Mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with  \ndifferential responsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapies. The objective response rate among patients with a sensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%.  This assay analyzes exons 18 -21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain; \nbased on the current literature, most mutations in non- small- cell \nlung carcinoma (NSCLC) are expected to occur in these exons.  \nMutations present in less than 10-20% of extracted DNA may not be detected by this method. Mutation status in a sample may change during tumor progression or the course of therapy; therefore, this result cannot be used to infer the presence or absence of a mutation in another sample or sub-sample obtained from this tumor.  This test is validated for non- small cell lung carcinoma. The  \nclinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types  \nis unknown.  METHOD:  \nTissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tu mor is  \n selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified  \nand amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to \nexons 18-21 of the EGFR gene.

COMMENT:  \nMutations in the KRAS gene are reported to be associated with poor prognosis, and resistance to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies in patients with non -small- cell lung cancer (NSCLC). KRAS  \nmutations occur in 15-30% of NSCLC patients and are strongly associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking history.  This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene; based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is vali dated for \nuse in identifying KRAS codon 12 and codon 13 mutations in fresh, frozen, or formalin -fixed paraffin embedded tissue. In particular \nthe test performance has been established in samples of colorectal  \ncancer and non- small cell lung carcinoma which harbor these \nmutations, although several other tissues are also known to harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix, etc.).  \n Analysis of EGFR mutation or gene amplification status may provide additional information regarding this patient's probability of response to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies, if clinically indicated. See references.  \n  METHOD/LIMITATIONS:  \nTissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is  \nselected for analysis. DNA is isolat ed from the sample, quantified \nand amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single \n nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13; \nprimer extension products ar e analyzed using capillary gel  \nelectrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n This test was developed and its performance characteristics  \ndetermined by The laboratory is regulated under  \nthe Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of (CLIA) as qualified to perform high complexity clinical testing.

Probe #Nuclei Examined % Positive Nuclei % Control values 2p23(ALK)V 100 0 <15.0 A total of 100 cells were scored.  \n FINDINGS: FISH was performed on paraffin embedded tissue sections using dual color break- apart probe to the ALK \ngene at 2p23. This probe flanks the entire gene. If a rearrangement involving ALK is present, inversion or translocation, one of the two probe signals separates as one red (orange) and one green signal. In  \nthis specimen, separated signals were present in 0.5% of the nuclei scored. Based on laboratory validation data, these results are within the normal limits.  \n COMMENTS: Three to four copies of ALK were observed in 27.0% of cells. This gain of intact ALK fusion hybridization signals  \nrepresents an aneuploid population with extra copies of chromosomes 2/2p ALK region.

        "llm_output": " The text appears to be a series of commands or function calls related to a medical report, possibly for a tumor or cancer case. Here are the categories and my justification for each:\n\n1. Site - This is the location in the body where the tumor originated. It's crucial for determining the type of cancer and the appropriate treatment.\n2. Laterality - This refers to the side of the body affected by the tumor, which can be important in certain types of cancer such as breast or lung cancer.\n3. Histology - This is the type of tissue where the tumor originated, such as epithelial, mesenchymal, or lymphoid tissue. It helps determine the type of cancer and the appropriate treatment.\n4. Stage - This is a measure of how far the cancer has spread in the body, which determines the prognosis and treatment options.\n5. Grade - This is a measure of how aggressive the cancer cells look under the microscope, which can help predict the behavior of the tumor.\n6. Behavior - This refers to whether the tumor is benign or malignant, which has implications for treatment and prognosis.\n\nJustification: These categories are commonly used in medical reports for tumors and cancer cases, and they provide essential information for determining the type of cancer, the appropriate treatment, and the prognosis."

Right upper lobe mass\nB.Additional right upper lobe for margins\nGROSS DESCRIPTION-\nA.Received fresh is a 10.5 x 5.5:x 3,5 cm wedge resection of lung. A staple tine indicates the resection margin.\nThe pleural surface, smooth and pale tan-red, shows minimal anthracotic stippling. Located approximately 2 cm\nfrom the staple line is a 1.0x 0.8 cm area of pleural puckering. Beneath the pleura is an ill-circumscribed mass\nmeasuring approximately 2.. 0 x 1.8 x 1.2 cm. The periphery of the mass is. firm and gray, and the center is\ncavitated, No additional masses are identified throughout the remaining parenchyma. Intraoperative touch\npreparations are prepared. A small portion of the mass, as well as normal lung, is obtained for the\nT'iree.sections of the mass with overlying. pleura (inked black) are submitted in Al-A3.\nINTRAOPERATIVE TOUCH PREP DIAGNOSIS: Non-small cell carcinoma.\nB.Received fresh is a 106 gram, 17 x 8.0 x 5.4 cm lobe of lung. The pleura exhibits minimal to moderate\nanthracotic.stippling. Towards the center of the resection is a 9.0 x 5.5 cm defect in the pleura; representing the\nprior wedge resection. The edges of the pleural defect are 1.5 cm or greater from the staple: liner Sections of the\nlung reveal a spongy tan-red parenchyma with no additional masses. Near the bronchial margin (which. is 2.5 cm\nor greater from the staple line) are several small anthracotic Lymph nodes: The bronchial margin is submitted for\nfrozen section in B1, representative sections of lung parenchyma in B2 and $3, and lymph nodes. in B4.\nFROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS: Bronchial margin negative for malignancy .Reported to\nImmu.nohistochemistryr Results\nForrnalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue is utilized.

Remark/addendum: \nThe carcinoma has infiltrated the visceral pleura also in the region of the adhesion site with the co-resected \npiece from the lower lobe of the lung. The resection margin of the bronchus and vessels, the parenchyma of the \nco-resected piece from the lower lobe of the lung and all excised lymph nodes are tumor-free. \nNo asbestos bodies are found in the prepared section planes. But very much further-reaching investigations, \nespecially dust analyses, are needed to determine the asbestos exposure of the lung. ",

Sectioning reveals a cystic like structure with a granular wall  \nthat is 3 x 2 x 1 cm and is does not contain any fluid.   The remaining portion  \nof tissue has a yellow -tan lobulated smooth and glistening cut surface.  \nResidual frozen tissue is  submitted in cassette A1.   Other representative  \nsections are submitted in cassettes A2- 3.  \n Part B is received in a single formalin filled container additionally labeled  \n\"11R\" and consists of a 2.1 x 1.8 x 1.4 cm red- brown irregular portion of soft  \ntissue .  The specimen is serially sectioned and submitted entirely in cassettes  \nB1-2.  \n Part C is received fresh for collection by the Tissue Bank and.   It \nis additionally labeled \"right upper lobe\" and consists of a previously incised  \nlung lobe that is 17 x 7 x  3.5 cm.   There is additionally, another portion of  \nlung tissue in the same container that is 7 x 3 x 0.7 cm, which most likely came  \nfrom the area previously incised on the larger portion.   There is an 8.3 x 3.5 x  \n3.5 cm white- tan irregular, partially necr otic mass where the previous incision  \nhas been made. This lesion abuts the pleural surface in this area and is 2 cm  \nfrom the nearest bronchial and vascular margin. The nearest lung parenchymal  \nmargin is 1.6 cm from the lesion.   Further sectioning of the mass reveals a  \nwhite to yellow -tan, multiloculated, partially hemorrhagic and necrotic mass.  \nThe mass appears to be involving the pleura, but not penetrating completely  \nthrough the pleura.    \n Representative sections are submitted as follows:  \n     C1      br onchial and vascular margins;  \n     C2 -3     mass to include overlying pleura;  \n     C4 -5     mass to include adjacent lung parenchyma;  \n     C6      uninvolved lung parenchyma.  \n Part D is received in a single formalin filled container additionally labeled  \n\"9R; inferior pulmonary ligament\" and consists of a 1.5 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm portion  \nof lymph node with attached fibrous tissue.

Onpalpation there is a firm to hard mass located in the \napical segment, predominantly on the postsromedial aspect. The mass measures approximately 60 x 65 \nx 40 mm in maximum dimension. There is puckering of the overlying pieural surface at the apex. The \npleural surface on the medial aspect of the specimen has a fibrinous-type exudate. On sectioning there \nis a solid lobulated tumour which has a yellow greyish-white cut surface. It, in places, has a villous\u00ad\nlike architecture. There is haemorrhage scattered throughout the tumour. The tumour appears to abut \nthe pleural surface. The tumour appears to lie at least 20 mm from the bronchial resection margin. \nThere is a soft tissue resection margin which has a row of staples and measures 85 mm in length. The \ntumour is well clear of this. The surrounding adjacent uninvolved lung parenchyma has a colhipsed \nappearance.

The findings include removal of a portion of the bronchus, dissection of pulmonary parenchyma along the staple line, and sampling of peribronchial lymph nodes. Some specimens show anthracotic discoloration, which is associated with exposure to coal dust or other environmental pollutants. The procedure also notes a honeycomb appearance in sections of the apical upper lobe, which may suggest interstitial lung disease. However, without microscopic examination and additional clinical information, it is difficult to provide more specific diagnostic information."

C 34.1; M 8070/3; 3. \nSecondary diagnosis/diagnoses: \nTumor necrosis varying in extent with the formation of a lacuna. Chronic resorptive and organizing pneumonia \nin the tumor environment and S3 periphery. Emphysematous stromal remodeling of lung parenchyma with \nformation of small subpleural cysts in the apex. Suspected respiratory bronchiolitis. Pleural adhesion zones and \nchronic fibrosing parietal pleuritis (sample 2.)). Lymph nodes with reactive follicular hyperplasia in some cases \n(e.g. samples 6.), 8.) and 12.)), in some cases sinus enlargement and an overall rather minor anthracotic pigment \ndeposit. \nRemark/addendum: \nThe main tumor mass lies in segments 3 and 2. Since the central segmental bronchi are tumor-free, it appears to \nbe a primarily peripheral carcinoma of the lung, which has invaded the pleura of the pleural fissure and the \nadhesion zone, although at the latter site the tumor manifestation appears confmed to the visceral layer.

Electronically signed\nADDENDUM #1 FOR MOLECULAR TESTS:\nKRAS, EGFR and ALK FISH were sent on\nThe test is to be performed on\nThe case report ,slides, and blocks for the cited\naccession number were retrieved from archives. The pathologist whose\nsignature appears below reviewed the original pathology report,\nexamined candidate H&E slides, and selected block 1 A appropriate to\nthe specifications of the ordered molecular analysis. x 1 H&E and x9\nunstained slides were prepared and forwarded to\nwhere the subject molecular test will be performed. An\naddendum report will be issued when the results of this molecular\ntest are available.\nAddendum # 1 performed by\nADDENDUM #2:\nINTEGRATED ONCOLOGY\nMOLECULAR ONCOLOGY\nKRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS\nReferring Physician:\nBody Site :Right lower lobe of lung\nSpecimen Type: Slides\nClinical Data :Adenocarcinoma\nRESULTS :Wild-type gene.\nINTERPRETATION:\nNo mutations were identified at codons 12 and 13 of the KRAS gene.\nCOMMENT:\nMutations in the KRAS gene are reported to be associated with poor\nprognosis ,and resistance to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor\ntherapies in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). KRAS mutations occur in 15 -30% of non -small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC)\npatients and are strongly associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking\nhistory.\nThis assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;\nbased on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are\nexpected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of\nthe assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low\npercentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated for\nuse in identifying KRAS codon 12 and codon 13 mutations in fresh,\nfrozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue. In particular\nthe test performance has been established in samples of colorectal\ncancer and non-small cell lung carcinoma which harbor these\nmutations, although several other tissues are also known to harbor\nKRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix,\netc.).\nAnalysis of EGFR mutation or gene amplification status may provide\nadditional information regarding this patient's probability of\nresponse to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies, if\nclinically indicated. See references.\nMETHOD/LIMITATIONS:\nTissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is\nselected for analysis .DNA is isolated from the sample ,quantified\nand amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to\nexon 2 of the KRAS gene .PCR products are subjected to single\nnucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;\nprimer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel\nelectrophoresis and fluorescence detection .False positive or\nnegative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants\nor somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.\nREFERENCES:\nNSCLC\nMascaux C ,lannino N ,et al.

The objective response rate among\npatients with a sensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%.\nThis assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain;\nbased on the current literature ,most mutations in non-small-cell\nlung carcinoma (NSCLC) are expected to occur in these exons.\nMutations present in less than 10-20% of extracted DNA may not be\ndetected by this method .Mutation status in a sample may change\nduring tumor progression or the course of the therapy; therefore,\nthis result cannot be used to infer the presence or absence of a\nmutation in another sample or sub -sample obtained from this tumor.\nThis test is validated for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The\nclinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types\nis unknown.\nMETHOD:\nTissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is\nselected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the samples, quantified\nand amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to\nexons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by\nbi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary gel\nelectrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or\nnegative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants\nor somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.\nREFERENCES:\n1.Azzoli CG, et al.

Sectioning reveals a large tumour present predominantly \nin the superior aspect of the lobe which measures 7S x 60 x 60 mm. The tumour has a pink and tan \ncolour and has a soft consistency. The tumour reaches the pleura but no definite invasion through the \npleura is seen grossly. The tumour extensively invades around bronchi and at one point tumour is seen \nto erode through the bronchial wall to form a polypoid mass measuring up to 10 mm within the \nbronchial lumen. This is present approximately 14 mm away from the nearest bronchial resection \nmargin. The tumour appears to come within approximately 2 mm of the hilar resection margin but \ntumour is not seen at a surgical resection margin. Located away from the main tumour within the \ninferomedial aspect of the lung are three separate tumour nodules measuring between S to 12 mm in \ndiameter. An area of fibrosis and calcification measuring up to 3 mm in diameter is also seen within \nthe region of one of the separate tumour nodules in the inferior aspect of the lobe. Lung tissue at the \nsuperio~ aspect of the lobe proximal to the tumour shows yellow discolouration. The lung in the \ninferior aspect of the lobe distal to the tumour appears fairly unremarkable. [I A, bronchial and hilar \nvascular resection margins; IB, vascular resection margin and lymph nodes; I C-l G, tumour with ID \nbeing mediastinal resection margin, I E bronchus with invasion by tumour; I G-lI, separate tumour \ndeposits inferior to the main tumour; lJ, uninvolved lung proximal to tumour; lK, uninvolved lung \ndistal to tumour.] \n2: The second specimen is labelled \"hilar lymph node\" and consists of multiple fragments of grey \ntissue measurin in aggregate approximately 20 x 20 x S mm. [BIT, 2A.] \nMICROSCOPY \nI: Sections show a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. Much of the tumour has the \ncytoarchitectural features of a non-mucinous bronchioloalveolar carcinoma, but unequivocal stromal \ninvasion is present, and an endobronchial component is confirmed. Tumour abuts but does not invade \nthe pleura, and the bronchial and mediastinal resection margins are clear of malignancy. No vascular \nor lymphatic invasion is identified. Peribronchial lymph nodes show no evidence of metastatic \nadenocarcinoma. Several satellite nodules are confirmed in lung parenchyma inferior to the main \ntumour mass. These show the BAC architecture and presumably represent spread through airways. \n2: Sections show fragments of lymph node in which there is no evidence of metastatic \nadenocarcinoll1 ~\\' \nSUMMARY \nRight lower lobectomy: Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with a large component of \nbronchioloalveolar carcinoma, 7S mm in diameter, with adjacent satellite nodules. \nNo pleural, vascular, lymphatic or perineural infiltration present. \nNo lymph node metastases. \nPathological stage T4 NO. \nT-28000 M-81403 PI-03000 \n \n",

Left lower lobe: inflated, fixed left lower lobe measuring 15 x 10 em at the base, up to 19.5 em high, central \nbronchus resection plane located at the level of bifurcation B6 and the bronchus of the lower group. A staple \nsuture line runs from the hilus in a ventral direction for 2.5 em, and a staple snture line runs from the hilus in a \ncranial direction for 3.5 em. Visceral pleura over S6/S!O in the laterodorsal region shows an area of whitish \nthickening and flat protrusion and retraction measuring about 6.5 x 3.5 em. Under this is a fum tumor, max. 5 \nem in size, with a vaguely arcuate configuration and central resorption. Peripheral branches ofB6, B9 and BlO \nleading into the tumor. Parenchyma in the tumor margin area partly compacted and pale. Inclusion of vascular \nbranches in the tumor. Rest of parenchyma largely inconspicuous. \n2.)

All material (in 13.) lamellated) \n17 blocks, partly Elastica-van Gieson, PAS, diastase-PAS \n Microscopy \nRe 1.): Tumor made up of complexes of destructive growth and longer, partly reticulate structures oflarge \natypical epithelia in a multilayered arrangement, repeatedly showing vaguely squamous cell layers, with partly \ncopious eosinophilic or clear, otherwise stained cytoplasm with inclusion of disorganized, anisomorphic nuclei \nof differing sizes, which also show an enlarged chromatin stmcture. Nucleoli always prominent. Intercellular \ngaps and bridges. Isolated small islands of large tumor cells layered rather like onion skins. Occasionally \nintracellular granular, diastase-digestible, PAS-positive particles and at the same time also small lacunae \nsurrounded by tumor cells and containing diastase-resistant, PAS-positive material, with epithelia here at the \nmargin also visible in parts as bronchioloalveolar in nature. Between the tumor cell structures smaller areas of \nnecrosis with partly degraded granulocytes and other cell debris. Then a lacuna formation with abundant \nnecrotic material, here and there remnants of delicate alveolar septa and vessels still visible. Also cholesterol \ncrystal gaps and accumulation of various inflammatory cells. Isolated relatively small vessels in the tumor with \ntumor cell nests in the lumen. In parts there is a transfer of tumor cell structures to original respiratory \nepithelium. In the region of cholesterol crystal gaps is an accumulation of large, mostly foamy macrophages \nalso within the very confined, nonoxygenated subpleural ( n?) that is still present. In \nsome sections, the tumor also extends directly to the pleura, where the pleural elastic fascia is destroyed and \ntranscended by a few tumor cell nests. Above this, the pleura is markedly enlarged in parts by connective tissue, \nand in the region of its surface is an accentuated accumulation of inflammatory cells, proliferation of \nmesenchymal spindle cells and capillary vessels and various inflammatory cells and fibrin plaque. Tumor \ngrowth in a central direction, partially surrounding larger vessels with infiltration and partial destruction of a \nbronchus. Further inflammatory cell infiltrates in the marginal adjacent parenchyma of the lung, where there are \ninterstitial follicular lymphocyte aggregates. Small intraalveolar groups of brown pigmented macrophages. \nOtherwise essentially preserved alveolar stroma. Only circumscribed lymphocyte-rich infiltrates in the region of \nthe peripheral airways and respiratory bronchioles and alveolar duct. No evidence of tumor at the 'resection \nmargins of bronchus and large pulmonary vessels. The stroma of the bronchus shows an increase in elastic \nconnective tissue fibers, as well as some chronic inflammatory cells, in part follicularly compressed aud also \nmanifest in the region of bronchial glands. A few of them are atrophied. In between or alongside are islets of \nfatty tissue. \nRe 2.) -13.) Some lymph nodes-in particular the larger ones-show an increase in secondary follicles with \ninclusion of large and partly active germinal centers. Small patches of anthracotic pigment deposits, \naccumulation oflarge-cell macrophages, in a few cases also small clusters of epithelioid monocytes. Partial \nenlargement of the sinus, with larger monocytoid cells here in places. \nEVALUATION \nPrimary diagnosis/diagnoses: \nLarge, peripheral, bronchopulmonary, histologically predominantly large-cell, slightly to moderately \ndifferentiated, nonkeratinizing squamous cell carcinoma of the left lower lobe of the lung. TNM classification \naccording to this picture pT2 pNO (0/23) VI RO. Stage m. C 34.3; M 8070/3. \nSecondary diagnosis/diagnoses: \nPartial necrotic tumor change with formation of a relatively large resorption lacuna. Tumor-associated active \nchronic, partially resorptive inflammation and also locally confined chronic fibrinous, partly already relatively \nhigh-grade fibrosing pleuritis. Signs suggestive of a slight respiratory bronchiolitis. Chronic bronchitis and \nsmall foci of fatty tissue metaplasia at the bronchus resection margin. Lymph node with slight anthracotic \npigment deposits and to some extent marked reactive follicular hyperplasia. \nRemark/addendum: \nTo a minimal extent the carcinoma has invaded the overlying visceral pleura, which is markedly fibrosed here. \nIn a central direction, the tumor has partially infiltrated and destroyed the bronchi of the basal group, the main \ntumor mass being located in cranial sections of segment 10. Bronchus and vessel resection margins are tumor\u00ad\nfree. \n",

Results reported by \nand repeat-back provided by  \n \nIntra -Operative Consultation #1 performed by \n \nFinal Diagnosis performed by \nsigned \n     ADDENDUM #1 FOR MOLECULAR TESTS:  \n KRAS, EGFR and ALK FISH were sent on  for patient,. The test is to be performed on tissue from case  \nThe case report, slides, and blocks for the cited \naccession number were retrieved from archives. The pathologist whose signature appears below reviewed the original pathology report, examined candidate H&E slides, and selected block 1D appropriate to  \nthe specifications  of the ordered molecular analysis. x1 H&E and x9 \nunstained slides were prepared and forwarded to where the  \nsubject molecular test will be performed. An addendum report will be issued when the results of this molecular test are available.  \n  \nAddendum #1 performed by  \nElectronically signed      \n \n \n \nMOLECULAR ONCOLOGY  \nKRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS  \n Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma  \n RESULTS: Wild type gene.  INTERPRETATION: No mutations w ere identified at codons 12 and 13 of \nthe KRAS gene.  \n COMMENT:  \nMutations in the KRAS gene are reported to be associated with poor prognosis, and resistance to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies in patients with non -small- cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  KRAS  \nmutations occur in 15-30% of NSCLC patients and are strongly associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking history.  This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene; based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of \nthe assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated for  \nuse in identifying KRAS codon 12 and codon 13 mutations in fresh, frozen, or formalin -fixed paraffin embedded tissue. In particular \nthe test performance has been established in samples of colorectal  \ncancer and non- small cell lung carcinoma which harbor these  \nmutations, although several other tissues are also known to harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix, etc.).  \n Analysis of EGFR mutation or gene amplification status may provide additional information regarding this patient's probability of response to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies, if \n clinically indicated. See references.  \n \nMETHOD/LIMITATION:  \nTissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is  \nselected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified  \nand amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to  \nexon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13; primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel  \nelectrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.  \n REFERENCES:  \n \n This test was developed and its performance characteristics  \ndetermined by  The laboratory is  \nregulated under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of \nas qualified to perform high complexity clinical  \ntesting. This particular test is not considered a stand alone test and should be only used in the context of other diagnostic tests or clinical work -up related to treatment decisions.\nis a business unit of  a \nwholly-owned subsidiary of  \n \n Electronically signed by: Date:   \n \n Addendum #2 performed by \n \n ADDENDUM #3:  \n \n \n \n  EGFR Mutation Analysis  \n \n Referring Physician:  \n Body Site: Right upper lobe of lung  Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma  \n RESULTS: No mutation detected.  \n INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified in the sample provided for analysis. Fewer than 5% of non- small cell lung carcinoma  \npatients without identifiable mutations are reported to  be \nresponsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies.   COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more tumor cellularity is optimal  \nfor this mutation analysis. The sample submitted showed 30% tumor cellularity upon pathologist review.  A frequently occurring s equence change 2361G>A (Q787Q) was \nidentified. This polymorphism is known not to have clinical significance.  \n Mutations in the tyrosine domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with differential  \nresponsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapies. The objective response rate among patients with a sensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%.  This assay analyzes exons 18 -21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain; \nbased on the current liter ature, most mutations in non- small- cell \nlung carcinoma (NSCLC) are expected to occur in these exons.  \nMutations present in less than 10-20% of extracted DNA may not be detected by this method. Mutation status in a sample may change during tumor progression or the course of therapy; therefore, this result cannot be used to infer the presence or absence of a mutation in another sample or sub-sample obtained from this tumor. \n  \nThis test is validated for non- small cell lung carcinoma. The  \nclinical significance an d utility of this test in other tumor types  \nis unknown.  METHOD/LIMITATION:  \nTissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is  \nselected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the samples, quantified  \nand amplified by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) using primers to  \nexons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by bi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary gel  \nelectrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or negative results may occur for reasons that include gene tic variants  \nor somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.  \n \n \n   DISCLAIMER:  \nThe test was developed and its performance characteristics  \ndetermined by  The laboratory is  \nregulated under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of \n (CLIA) as qualified to perform high complexity clinical  \ntesting.

Nl metastases. \nMACROSCOPIC \nFour specimens received: \n1: The first specimen is labelled \"left lung\" and consists of a left pneumonectomy specimen which \nmeasures 180 x 150 x 40 mm. Located in the apex of the left lower lobe is a large peripheral tumour \nmeasuring 70 x 65 x 45 mm. There is some puckering of the overlying pleura above the tumour but \ndefinite invasion to the pleura cannot be identified grossly. Many enlarged hilar lymph nodes and \nintraparenchymallymph nodes are identified but none of these show macroscopic evidence of tumour \ninvolvement. Elsewhere the visceral pleura and parenchyma show prominent carbon pigmentation. \nThe visceral pleura at the apex of the left upper lobe shows a cream papule. No other lesions are \nidentified grossly. [1 A, bronchial and pulmonary artery hilar resection margin; 1 B-1 C, bronchial \nlymph node; ID, interlobar lymph node; lE-lG, tumour with overlying pleura; IH-lJ, \nintraparenchymallymph nodes from left lower lobe; lK, intraparenchymallymph nodes from left \nupper lobe; lL, lung away from tumour in left lower lobe; 1M, lung from left upper lobe; IN, further \nsection of tumour and adjacent uninvolved parenchyma.] \n2: The second specimen is labelled \"hilar lymph node No.1\" and consists of a lymph node measuring \n6 mm in diameter. [BIT, 2A.] \n3: The third specimen is labelled \"No.2 hilar lymph node\" and consists of two fragments of nodal \ntissue, the largest measuring approximately 12 mm in diameter. [Bisected, blocked with smaller \nfragment,3A.] \n4: The fourth specimen is labelled \"lymph node No.8\" and consists of two fragments of nodal tissue, \nthe largest measuring approximately 1 0 mm in diameter. The other fragment appears to contain \nmultiple nodes on sectioning. [Each fragment bisected, BIT, 4A-4B.] \nMICROSCOPY \n1: Sections show a moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma which abuts but does not \ninvade the pleura. There are extensive areas of tumour necrosis and several blood vessels within the \ntumour are obliterated but definite vascular invasion is not found. No lymphatic or perineural \ninfiltration is seen. Peribronchial lymph nodes show reactive hyperplasia, anthracosis and a few small \nsilicotic nodules but defmite tumour metastases are not found. However metastatic carcinoma is \npresent within intraparenchymallymph nodes from the left lower lobe (lJ). A single fragment sampled \nas a peribronchial lymph node appears to represent a fragment of the primary tumour (lD). Lung \nparenchyma away from the tumour shows a marked degree of peribronchial and interlobular septal \nanthracosis. There is also upper lobe emphysema and pleural fibrosis. \n2: Sections show a small lymph node in which there is no evidence of malignancy. \n3: Sections show partial replacement of the lymph node by metastatic adenocarcinoma. \n4: Sections show reactive lymph nodes with anthracosis and occasional silicotic nodules. There is no \nevidence of metastatic carcinoma. \nSUMMARY \nLeft pneumonectomy and lymph node sampling : \nModerately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, 70 mm in diameter. \nNo pleural, vascular or perineural infiltration seen. \nMetastases in intraparenchymal and hilar lymph nodes. \nPathological stage T2 Nl. \n",

The pathologist whose  \nsignature appears below reviewed the original pathology report,  \nexamined candidate H&E slides, and selected block 1D appropriate to  \nthe specifications of the ordered molecular analysis. x1 H&E and x9  \nunstained slides were prepared and forwarded to  where the  \nsubject molecular test will be performed. An addendum report will be  \nissued when the results of this molecular test are available.  \n \n  Addendum #1 performed by  \n \n    \nADDENDUM 2:  \n  \n \n \nRESULTS: Positive for a p.G12A (c.35G>T) mutation in codon 12 of  \nthe KRAS gene.  \n \nINTERPRETATION: Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to  \ncorrelate with poor prognosis and resistance to tyrosine kinase \ninhibitor therapies in patients with non- small lung cancer.  \n COMMENT:  \nKRAS mutations occur in 15- 30% of non- small- cell lung cancer (NSCLC)  \npatients and are strongly associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking history.  \n This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;  \nbased on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are  \nexpected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of  \nthe assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low  \npercentage of cells may not be detected.  \n \nThis test is validated for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and  \ncodon 13 mutations in fresh, frozen, or formalin- fixed paraffin \nembedded tissue. In particular the test performance has been  \nestablished in samples of colorectal cancer and non- small cell lung  \ncarcinoma which harbor these mutations, although several other  \ntissues are also known to harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of  \npancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix, etc.).  \n \nMETHOD/L IMITATION: \n \nTissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is  \nselected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified  \nand amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to \nexon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single  \nnucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;  \nprimer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel  \nelectrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or  \nnegative results may occur for reasons that inc lude genetic variants  \nor somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.  \n \nREFERENCES:  \n \n \n  \n \n \nThi\ns test was developed and its performance characteristics  \ndetermined by It has not been cleared or approved by the  \nUS Food and Drug Administration.

The analytical  \nsensitivity of the assay is 10- 20%, thus mutations present in a low  \npercentage of cells may not be detected.  \n Most data published to date pertain to gefitinib (Iressa(r)).  \nSimilar da ta have been seen in studies using erlotinib (Tarceva(r)).  \n Homozygosity for the frequently occurring sequence change 2361 G>A  \nwas identified. The polymorphism is not likely to have clinical  \nsignificance.  \n This test is validated for non- small cell lung carcinoma. The \nclinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types  \nis unknown.  \n \nMETHOD:  \nTissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is  \nselected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the samples, quantified  \nand amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to \nexons 18- 21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by  \nbi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary gel  \nelectrophoresis and fluorescence detection.

The test is to be performed on tissue from cas e  \naccession number were retrieved from archives. The pathologist whose \nsignature appears below reviewed the original pathology report, \nexamined candidate H&E slides, and selected block 1A appropriate to the specifications of the ordered molecular analysis. x1 H&E and x9 unstained slides were prepared and forwarded to  \n where the subject molecular test will be performed. An \naddendum report will be issued when the results of this molecular  \ntest are available.  \n  Addendum #1 performed by \n \nADDENDUM #2:  \n  MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY  \n KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS  \n \n \n RESULTS: Wild -type gene  \n \n INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified at codons 12 and 13 \nof the KRAS gene.  COMMENT:  \nMutations in the KRAS gene are reported to be associated with  poor \nprognosis, and resistance to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies in patients with non -small- cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  \n KRAS mutations occur in 15-30% of NSCLC patients and are strongly associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking history.  This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene; \nbased on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated  \nfor use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and codon 13 mutations in fresh, frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue. In particular the test performance has been established in samples of colorectal cancer and non -small cell lung carcinoma which harbor  \nthese mutations, although several other tissues are also known to harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix, etc.).  Analysis of EGFR mutation or gene ampl ification status may provide  \nadditional information regarding this patient's probability of response to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies, if clinically indicated. See references.  \n METHOD/LIMITATIONS:  \nTissue sections are reviewed by a pathologis t and relevant tumor is  \nselected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified  \nand amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13; primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel  \nelectrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.  \n REFERENCES:  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nG\n \n \n        Addendum #2 performed by \n \nADDENDUM #3:  \n  INTEGRATED ONCOLOGY  \n  EGFR Mutation Analysis  \n \n \n \n Body Site: Left lower lobe of lung  \n \nClinical Data: Adenocarcinoma  \n RESULTS: Positive for the E746_A750del5 mutation in Exon 19.  \n INTERPRETATION: Deletion mutations in exon 19, mostly involving the  \nLREA motif, are reported to correlate with responsiveness to EGFR  \ntyrosine kinase inhibitor in patients with non- small- cell lung  \ncarcinoma.  \n  COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more tumor ce llularity is optimal  \nfor this mutation analysis. The sample submitted showed 80% tumor  \ncellularity upon pathologist review.  \n E746_A750del5 corresponds to 2236_2250del15.  A frequently occurring sequence change 2361G>A (Q787Q) was  \nidentified. This polymorphism is known not to have clinical  \nsignificance.  \n Mutations in the tyrosine domain of the epidermal growth factor  \nreceptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with differential  \nresponsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)  \ntherapies. The objective response rate among patients with a  \nsensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%.  \n This assay analyzes exons 18 -21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain;  \nbased on the current literature, most mutations in non- small- cell \nlung carcinoma (NSCLC ) are expected to occur in these exons.  \nMutations present in less than 10- 20% of extracted DNA may not be  \ndetected by this method. Mutation status in a sample may change  \nduring tumor progression or the course of therapy; therefore, this  \nresult cannot be us ed to infer the presence or absence of a mutation  \nin another sample or sub- sample obtained from this tumor. \n This test is validated for non- small cell lung carcinoma. The  \nclinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types  \nis unknown.  METH OD/LIMITATION:  \nTissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is  \nselected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the samples, quantified  \nand amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to exons 18- 21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by   bi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary gel  \nelectrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or \nnegative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.  \n REFERENCES:  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n  \n \n \n     \n3  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n",

All fragments are submitted in cassette F for frozen section\ndiagnosis. G. Specimen G is designated \"lung, right upper lobe bronchial\nmargin.\" The specimen consists of a 263 gm right lower lobectomy\nmeasuring 14.3 x 10.2 x 6.0 cm. The pleural surface is remarkable for a\nunderlying mass adjacent to the bronchus. The bronchial margin is\nremoved and submitted enface for frozen section diagnosis. The\nremainder of the pleural surface is inked blue. The specimen is\nsectioned revealing an exophytic, tan-white, solid-appearing lesion\nmeasuring 5.0 x 4.9 x 3.9 cm. The lesion is adjacent to the hilum and\n0.1 cm from the bronchial margin. This lesion appears to abut the\nserosal surface, where no serosal extension is noted. Sectioning the\nremainder of the lung parenchyma has a consolidated, tan-red appearance\nwith areas of mucus plugging. No additional mass or lesions are\npresent. Representative tissue was procured for potential future\nstudies. The specimen is sampled in 14 cassettes.\nSummary of Cassettes:\nG1- bronchial margin, en face (frozen section).\nG2 - three potential lymph nodes.\nG3 - single lymph node bisected.\nG4 - vascular margin.\nG5-G7 - tumor closest to dominant airway.\nG8-G11 - additional tumor with adjacent soft tissue.\nG12-G14 - uninvolved lung parenchyma. H. Specimen H is designated \"lymph node station 4 R.\" The\nspecimen consists of three tan-red, spongy-appearing tissue fragments\nranging in size from 2.0 to 0.8 cm in greatest dimension. All fragments\nare submitted intact in two cassettes.\n1.

On sectioning in the central portion of the specimen there\nis an intraparenchymal 1.0 x 0.9 x 0.7 cm lobulated gray tan\nfibrotic nodular lesion noted 0 .4 cm from the nearest staple line\nmargin. This has a gritty gray tan fibrotic cut surface. The\nremaining parenchyma is spongy congested and markedly anthracotic\nstreaked with moderate honeycombing. The specimen is step sectioned\nand entirely submitted in 10 cassettes.\nContainer labeled'4 - level4 lymph node\" are\n1.6 x 1.0 x 0.3 cm of gray brown to black fleshy tissue fragments\nwhich are entirely submitted in a single cassette.\nContainer labeled ' 5 - level 7 lymph node\" are\n4.0 x 2.2 x 1.1 cm partially fragmented lobulated portion of fleshy\ngray black tissue with a slightly mottled fleshy gray black cut\nsurface. This is received along with 1.2 x 0.9 x 0.4 cm of similar\nirregular tissue fragments .The largest portion is sectioned and\nsubmitted labeled A-E while the smaller portion is entirely\nsubmitted labeled F.\nIM\nMicroscopic Description:\nSections of specimen #2 show a large cell malignant neoplasm that in\nareas shows prominent gland formation. These glandular area blend\ninto more solid nests of neoplastic cells. These are supported by a\ndense fibrous stroma and alternate with areas of necrosis. The\nneoplasm extends into the pleural but not onto the pleural surface.\nSections of the neoplasm within the right upper lobe specimen #3\nshow a large cell malignant neoplasm with a distinctly different\ngrowth pattern. In this neoplasm the cells form sheets that have\nirregular borders. The cells have a moderate amount of eosinophilic\ncytoplasm and enlarged pleomorphic nuclei.\nSections of the lymph node specimens show no areas of metastatic\ncarcinoma.\nlmmunohistochemical stains are performed on the neoplasm in the\nright lower lobe specimen and right upper lobe specimen. The right lower lobe specimen shows the neoplasm to be positive for CK7 andnegative for CK20 .Some of the cells are strongly positive for\nTTF1. These are in the more glandular areas .The more solid areasare negative for this marker .The more solid areas do express\npositivity for CDX -2 where the glandular areas tend to be negative\nfor this marker .The cells are negative for p63 .This staining\npattern would support this being an adenocarcinoma of pulmonary\norigin .It is unclear why some of the cells mark with the\ncolorectal marker CDX-2. This same panel performed on the right\nupper lobe specimen show the neoplastic cells to be negative for\nboth CK7 and CK20. The cells are negative for CDX-2 and TTF1. Thecells are strongly positive for p63 .This staining pattern would\nsupport this being a squamous carcinoma that is very poorly\ndifferentiated .The immunohistochemical control slides stain\nappropriately.\nFinal Diagnosis\nRight lung lower lobe wedge biopsy #1 with frozen section:\nNegative for carcinoma.\nAlveolar changes focally with pneumocyte hyperplasia consistent\nwith organizing pneumonia\nand atelectasis.\nFrozen section diagnosis is confirmed.\nLung ,right lower lobe wedge biopsy #2 with frozen section:Tumor characteristics:\nHistologic type :Adenocarcinoma.\nHistologic grade :Poorly differentiated.\nTumor size: 2 .7 x 2.5 x 2.0 cm.\nTumor focality :Single focus of right lower lobe.\nVisceral pleural invasion :Yes (PLI).\nLymphovascular space invasion :Not identified,\nTumor extension :Not identified.\nTreatment effect Not identified.\nSurgical margin status:\nTumor distance from bronchial margin :Not applicable.Tumor distance from stapled margin :0.8 cm.Lymph node status:\nSee specimens four and five.\nLung,right upper lobe, wedge biopsy:\nHistologic type :Poorly differentiated squamous carcinoma (see\nabove comments).\nHistologic grade :Poorly differentiated.\nTumor site :Right upper lobe.\nTumor focality :Right upper lobe, single focus\nTumor size: 1 .0 x 0.9 x 0.7 cm.\nVisceral pleural invasion :Not identified.\nLymphovascular space invasion: No.\nTumor extension: No.\nTreatment effect :Not identified.\nSurgical margin status:\nTumor distance from bronchial margin: Not applicable.\nTumor distance from parenchymal stapled margin :0.4 cm.Tumor distance from pleural surface :0.8 cm (as measured onhistologic sections).\nLymph node status:\nSee specimens four and five.\nLymph node level 4 ,excisional biopsy:\nNegative for tumor (0/1).\nLymph node level 7 ,excisional biopsy:\nNegative for tumor (O/1).\nPathology stage: CommentsThe tumor morphology present in specimen three shows focal areas\nwith morphology compatible with a poorly differentiated\nadenocarcinoma.

Right lung: inflated, fixed right lung measuring 14 x 12 em at the base and up to 26 em high, central \nbronchus resection plane located 1 em upstream of the upper lobe bronchus. Dorsomedial and basal pleura over \nS10 shows an area of max. 7.5 x 4 em with roughening or residual adhesion, in the basal region over S7 is a 3 \nem similar area, Intermediate bronchus in the region of the middle lobe bronchus bifurcation and proximal \nsections of the bronchi of the basal group narrowed by a moderately firm, predominantly pale brownish-white \ntumor with small patches of grayish-black pigmentation, max. 4.7 em in size, with unclear and arcuate \ndemarcation, with the main mass in SIO and adjacent sections ofS6, S7 and S9, extending to within 0.2 em of \nthe medial visceral pleura over SIO. Truncation of B9 and BIO and also a subsegmental branch of B7 in the \ntumor. Focal crossing of lower pleural fissure and infiltration of middle lobe. In the tumor environment some \nsatellite foci up to 0.2 em in size. Peripheral sections of basal bronchial branches dilated and filled with thick \nmucus. Parenchyma below the adhesion zone over SIO shows diffuse induration and a brown vitreous \nappearance. In the mediocaudal region of the upper lobe bronchus bifurcation next to the pulmonary artery a 2.5 \nem node firmly adherent to the vascular wall with predominantly whitish section surfaces and extension right up \nto the hilar resection surface, not continuity wit tumor. At the intermediate bronchus a 0. 7 em node part \nsuggestive of a tumor, next to the lower lobe bronchus part a 0.5 em grayish-black node.

Tumor made up to solid structures of large atypical epithelia, densely packed in parts, with copious, \nmostly stained cytoplasm with the inclusion of isolated very large, otl1erwise often round, occasionally \ndeformed nuclei containing granular chromatin and always prominent nucleoli. Apoptoses, not uncommonly \nseveral mitoses per markedly enlarged visual field (field length 0.61 mm). Occasionally a vague epidermoid \nlayer, often intercellular fissures and isolated visible bridges. No mucin inclusion. In places a dissociation of the \ntumor cell structures. Smaller areas of necrosis. Affected lung parenchyma pmtly destroyed, likewise a \n relatively a large bronchus here, strand of cartilage remaining. A further large bronchus partially infiltrated and \ninvolved in the tumor, likewise in this area smaller bronchi and bronchioles whose lumen is partly dilated, the \noriginal respiratory epithelium replaced by tumor epithelium. In adjacent region tumor cell nests and fonnations \nof small tumor lie freely in alveoli, also tumor cell structures in dilated lymph vessels. Vascularized interlobular \nsepta. between the tumor formations partly loose, partly fiber-rich, collagenous connective tissue with \naccumulation of iuflammatmy cells. Isolated small vessels here, walls thickened by elastosis and containing \ntumor cells. A larger vein surrounded, loose capillary-containing fiber tissue in the lumen. Between peripheral \ntumor margin and visceral pleura on the medial side a strip of free lung parenchyma with partly deficient \natelectasis and thickened alveolar septa. Lower pleural fissure and partly fused visceral pleura demarcating or \ncovering this fissure transcended by tumor, where large bronchi are invaded to within close proximity of the \nmucosa. Large tumor node next to the upper lobe bronchus bifurcation, enclosed anthracotic pigment, tumor \ncell nests here at the resection margin. In the mediastinal tissue a further tumor-compromised lymph node with \nanthracotic pigment deposits and otherwise fibrous growth of connective tissue. In subpleural region of Sl a flat \nremodeling zone of the lung parenchyma with development of collagenous and elastic connective tissue, with \nalveolar stroma still partly recognizable. Nearby tiny radial areas of interstitial fibrosis with small patches of \naccumulated anthracotic pigment. In the basal lower lobe am relatively large area of nonoxygenated, fibrosed \nlung parenchyma with inclusion of partly obliterated smaller, partly patent vessels and bronchioles. Overlying \npleura markedly enlarged and fibrotic. Otherwise here and there in dilated peripheral ainvays mucus and \nleukocytes and also a small cluster of pigment-storing macrophages in the alveoli. At the bronchus resection \nmargin, sections of mucosal epithelium are interrupted, othenvise regular. Here as in the walls of the large \npulmonary vessels no evidence of tumor cells. Lymph node at the hilus with isolated secondary follicles, slight \nplaque of anthracotic pigment and foci oflarge macrophages. \nRe 2.) -b.) Partly preserved lymph nodes with few secondary follicles, varying degrees of anthracotic pigment \ndeposits, accumulation of macrophages and isolated secondary follicles. In parts, lymph nodes are largely \noccupied by solid epithelial tumor. In places, tumor manifestation also in the paranodal tissue. At one point and \nin a larger lymph node only very small areas occupied by tumor cell nests. \nEVALUATION \nPrimary diagnosis/diagnoses: \nCentral bronchopulmonary, histologically largely undifferentiated, large-cell squamous cell carcinoma of the \nright lower lobe of the lung (C4) with overgrowth of the interlobar fissure and continuous growth into the \nadjacent section of the middle lobe and also several in some cases large lymph node metastases. Tumor \nclassification according to this picture pT2 pN3 Ll VI Rl, stage IIIB. C34.3 M8070/3. \nSecondary diagnosis/diagnoses: \nPeripheral bronchiolectasia in the lower lobe, relatively large fibrous cicatricial remodeling zone in S I 0 \nmediobasal and similar flat subpleural cicatricial zones in Sl apical. Local high-grade pleural fibrosis over SlO. \nTwnor-associated inflammation and small tumor necroses. Slight anthracotic pigment deposits in the lung \nparenchyma and relatively marked in some lymph nodes. \nRemark/addendum: \nThe main mass of the carcinoma lies in SJO. Centrally it has grown as far as the bifurcations of the lower lobe \nmain bronchus and the middle lobe bronchus, without these being destroyed or constricted. The tumor invasion \nof small blood vessels only concerns the focal region, the lymphangioinvasion is more marked and is also \nlocated in the vicinity of the tumor focus. The Rl classification is based on the fmding that carcinoma nests in \nthe large involved lymph nodes next to the bifurcation of the upper lobe bronchus extend to the mediastinal \nresection plane. Further lymph node metastases are seen at the intermediate bronchus in the mediastinum and \nalso in the lymph nodes located under 4.) -6.). The pN3 classification is also made with regard to the previous \nfinding with carcinoma cell structures in the fine needle aspiration biopsy from LN4 left (according to clinical \ndata). ",

Most of the pleural surfaces are smooth, glistening \nand light to medium purple-brown. It weighs 2ilO grams. The \nbronchial resection margin portion of the most hilar aspect of the \nspecimen is a bronchus 1.1 x 0.9 em across. This resection margin \nis shaved from the specimen and submitted as a frozen section block. \nTwo nodules are palpated in the upper aspect of the lobe and both \nshow some degree of overlying puckering of the pleural surfaces . \nThese are marked by me with blue dye. The more lateral lesion is \ncut across and reveals a subpleural , Io.'hite and gray speckled lesion \n2.0 x 1.7 cm on cut surface.

The frozen section control confirms the frozen section findings \nof a proximal bronchial resection margin that is negative for tumor. \nThe t\\'10 foci containing gross tumor, the more laterally situated and \nthe more atypically situated have identical histology with areas \nshowing adenocarcinoma growing in scar tissue \\\",ith some areas \nshowing more clear cell patterns to the cytoplasm and other areas \nhaving more eosinophilic and darker cytoplasm . Some of the latter \ntumor grows in a lepidic pattern including focally into the visceral \npleura, with at least one small focus deposited and stuck to the \noutside of the visceral pleura ). Deeper sections have been \nmade of these foci. The section taken between the two nodules, \nalthough not grossly involved, has microscopic involvement of \nadditional invasive adenocarcinoma which therefore shows a \nconnection between these two otherwise apparently separate nodules . \nThus, I think this is a single tumor with a so-called dumbbell shape \nand both foci of tumors making the larger nodules have mixtures of \nclear-type cytoplasm and eosinophilic-type cytoplasm . Emphysema is \nalso found within the lung. \nA focus of tumor shows growth into a thick-walled blood vessel, \nprobably a vein.

Part one is received fresh, labeled 'left upper lobe wedge  \nresection, r/o carcinoma'. It consists of a wedge shaped portion of  \nlung, measuring 9 x 4 x 4 cm. The specimen weighs 36 grams. There is  \na staple line identified on the specimen measuring 9 cm and 3 cm in length. The staple line is inked black and the pleural surface is  \ninked blue. The pleural surface shows dimpling at one area. Serial  \nsectioning of the specimen reveals a gray white firm irregular mass,  \nmeasuring 3.5 x 3.4 x 1.8 cm. The mass is 1 cm away from the s taple  \nline. The mass has a gray white cut surface. The remainder of the  \nlung has tan pink spongy parenchyma. One piece cut from the mass is  \nsubmitted for intraoperative microscopic examination. Representative  \nsections are submitted.  \n 2. Part two is received in formalin, labeled 'station #9 lymph  \nnode'. It consists of a single piece of tan maroon irregular soft  \ntissue, measuring 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm. The specimen is bisected and  \nentirely submitted.  \n 3. Part three is received in formalin, labeled 'station #11 l ymph  \nnode'. It consists of a single piece of tan maroon irregular soft  \ntissue consistent with lymph node, measuring 1.5 x 0.9 x 0.2 cm. The  \nspecimen is bisected and entirely submitted for microscopic  \nexamination.  \n 4. Part four is labeled 'upper lobe completion lobectomy'. It  \nconsists of a lobe of lung measuring 15 x 8 x 4 cm. The specimen \nweighs 169 grams. There are two staple lines identified on the  \nspecimen, measuring 15 cm and 8 cm in length. The staple line is  \ninked black. The bronchus measures 2.5 cm in diameter and the  \nbronchial vessels measures 2.0 cm in diameter. The bronchial  \nvascular margin is shaved. Serial sectioning of the specimen shows  \ntan maroon spongy parenchyma. No definite mass lesion or fibrosis is  \nidentified. Representative sections are submitted for microscopic  \nexamination.  \n \n \n \nSUMMARY OF SECTIONS:  \n1A mass, frozen section control  \n1B-1C mass (entire measurement)  \n1D-1E mass  \n1F stapled margin, entirely submitted 1G tumor, with adjacent to lung parenchyma close to the staple  \nline \n1H normal lung parenchyma 2A single bisected lymph node  \n3A single bisected lymph node  \n 4A bronchial margin of resection  \n4B vascular margin of resection  \n4C three peribronchial lymph nodes  \n4D stapled margins  \n4E-4H random sections from the unremarkable lung parenchyma  \n \nSPECIAL PROCEDURES:  \n \n \n    \n \n    \n \nINTRA - OPERATIVE CONSULTATION:  \n 1. Lung left upper lobe: wedge resection (Frozen Section)  \n- Adenocarcinoma, probably invasive.  \n Result reported by \n \n  \nIntra- Operative Consultation #1 performed by  \n \n \n \n \n ADDENDUM #1 FOR MOLECULAR TESTS:  \n \nKRAS and EGFR were sent on for patient  \n. The test is to be performed on tissue from case \n The case report, slides, and blocks for the \ncited accession number were retrieved from archives. The pathologist  \nwhose signature appears below reviewed the original pathology  \nreport, examined candidate H&E slides, and selected block 1D  \nappropriate to the specifications of the ordered molecular analysis.  \nx9 unstained slides were prepared and forwarded to where the  \nsubject molecular test will be performed. An addendum report will be  \nissued when the results of this molecular test are available.  \n \n  \n  \nAddendum #1 performed by  \n \n \n \nADDENDUM #2:  \n \n  MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY  \n KRAS MUT ATION ANALYSIS  \n \nSpecimen #\nBody Site: Left upper lobe of lung  \nSpecimen Type: Slides  \nClinical Data: Adenocarcinoma  \n RESULTS: Wild -type gene.  \n INTERPRETATION:  \nNo mutations were identified at codons 12 and 13 of the KRAS gene.  \n COMMENT:  \nMutations in the KRAS gene are reported to be associated with poor  \nprognosis, and resistance to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor  \ntherapies in patients with non- small- cell lung cancer (NSCLC). KRAS  \nmutations occur in 15- 30% of NSCLC patients and are strongly \nassociated with adenocarcinoma and smoking history.  \n This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;  \nbased on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are  \nexpected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of  \nthe assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low  \npercentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated  \nfor use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and codon 13 mutations in  \nfresh, frozen, or formalin- fixed paraffin embedded tissue. In  \nparticular the test performance has been established in samples of  \ncolorectal cancer and non- small cell lung carcinoma which harbor  \nthese mutations, although several other tissues are also known to  \nharbor KRAS mutations (e.g.  tumors of pancreas, bile duct, ovary,  \nappendix, etc.).  \n Analysis of EGFR mutation or gene amplification status may provide  \nadditional information regarding this patient's probability of  \n response to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies, if  \nclinical ly indicated. See references.  \n \n \nMETHOD/LIMITATIONS:  \nTissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is  \nselected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified  \nand amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to \nexon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single  \nnucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;  \nprimer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel  \nelectrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or  \nnega tive results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants  \nor somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.  \n \nREFERENCES:  \n \n \n \n \n This test was developed and its performance characteristics  \ndetermined by .

The analytical  \nsensitivity of the assay is 10- 20%, thus mutations present in a low  \npercentage of cells may not be detected.  \n Most data published to date pertain to gefitinib (Iressa(r)).  \nSimilar data have been seen in studies using erlotinib (Tarceva(r)).  \n \nHomozygosity for the frequently occurring sequence change 2361 G>A  \nwas identified. The polymorphism is not likely to have clinical  \nsignificance.  \n \nThis test is validated for non- small cell lung carcinoma.

The pathologist whose\nsignature appears below reviewed the original pathology report,\nexamined candidate H&E slides, and selected block 1 C appropriate to\nthe specifications of the ordered molecular analysis. x 1 H&E and x9\nunstained slides were prepared and forwarded tc\nvhere the subject molecular test will be performed. An\naddendum report will be issued when the results of this molecular\ntest are available.\nAddendum #2 performed by\nADDENDUM 3:\nIntegrated Oncology\nMOLECULAR ONCOLOGY\nKRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS\nRESULTS: Positive for a p.G12C (c.34G> T) mutation in codon 12 of the KRAS gene.\nINTERPRETATION: Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to\ncorrelate with poor prognosis and resistance to tyrosine kinase\ninhibitor therapies in patients with non-small lung cancer.\nCOMMENT:\nKRAS mutations occur in 15-30% of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC)\npatients and are strongly associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking\nhistory.\nThis assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;\nbased on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are\nexpected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of\nthe assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low\npercentage of cells may not be detected.\nThis test is validated for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and\ncodon 13 mutations in fresh, frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin\nembedded tissue. In particular the test performance has been\nestablished in samples of colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung\ncarcinoma which harbor these mutations, although several other\ntissues are also known to harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of\npancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix, etc.).\nMETHOD/LIMITATION:\nTissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is\nselected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified\nand amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to\nexon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single\nnucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;\nprimer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel\nelectrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or\nnegative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants\nor somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.\nREFERENCES:\nNSCLC\nMascaux C, Iannino N, et al.

Lung, left, pneumonectomy (FS) - Bronchial margin, negative for neoplasm\nPage 2 of 5 SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT\nClinical Diagnosis:\nH/O LUNG CANCER\nPage 3 of 5 SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT\nGross Description:\nA. Received in formalin is a specimen labeled \"left lung\". The specimen consists of a lung\nmeasuring 15 x 10 x 7.5 cm, tightly adhered pericardium measuring 10 x 8.5 x 0.5 cm and diaphragm\nmeasuring 4.5 x 2 x 0.2 cm. The specimen weighs 606 grams. The bronchial remnant measures 2.4\ncm in length and 1.4 cm in diameter. The pericardium is inked green, the diaphragm margin is inked\nblack, the mediastinal soft tissue margin and perihilar pleural surface is inked blue. The pleura is\nincomplete on the lateral aspect of the lung on both the upper and lower lobes (orange ink). The\ndiaphragmatic surface of the lung is also incomplete with an open defect showing a visibly necrotic\ncavity within the lower lobe of the lung. No areas of puckering are present along the pleural surface.\nThe specimen is sectioned in a transverse plane to reveal a firm, gray-white mass with central necrosis\nmeasuring 8 x 7 x 6 cm. The necrosis is more prominent in the most inferior aspect of the lung. The\ngreatest dimension of the mass is in the cranial caudal plane. The mass is present from the hilar region\nand extends inferior through the lower lobe to the diaphragmatic aspect. The lung parenchyma adjacent\nto the mass is soft and tan-orange. The upper and lower lobes are firmly adhered at the oblique fissure\nin the area of the mass showing possible involvement in the upper lobe (section A14). The mass does\ninvolve the bronchus and extending within 1.5 cm from the bronchial margin .The mass grossly abuts\nthe diaphragm margin (black inked), the medial pleural surface at the level surrounding the hilum (blue\ninked) and the lateral pleural defect (inked orange). The mass comes within 0.3 cm of the mediastinal\ntissue margin (blue inked) and within 0.5 cm of the pericardial margin ( green inked). The vessels at the\nhilar level appear to be grossly involved. Mucous plugs are identified diffusely throughout the bronchi.\nThe mucous plugs are prominent within the posterior aspect of the upper and lower lobe bronchioles\nranging in size from 0.1 to 0.2 cm. The upper lobe lung parenchyma appears grossly unremarkable and\nis smooth, red and spongy. No intraparenchymal lymph nodes are identified. Peribronchial lymph\nnodes are identified and range in size from 0.3 to 1.3 cm. Perihilar lymph nodes are identified and\nrange in size from 0.9 to 1.6 cm. Representative sections are submitted as follows: A2 - vascular\nshave margin; A3 -A5 - mass in relationship to diaphragm; A6 - mass in relationship to mediastinal soft\ntissue margin; A7 and A8 - mass in relationship to pericardial margin; A9 - mass in relationship to\nbronchus and pleura; A10 through A13 - mass in relationship to pleural margin; A14 - mass at lung\nfissure ;A15 - mass in relationship to hilar vasculature; A16 - mass in relationship to lateral pleural\ndefect; All and Al 8 - additional sections of mass non-marginal; Al 9 and A20 - sections of upper lobe\nposterior aspect with mucus plugs; A21 - section of upper lobe anterior aspect; A22 - section of upper\nlobe middle aspect; A23 - section of apex; A24 - perihilar lymph nodes; A25- A26 - peribronchial lymph\nnodes.\nB.

On sectioning, the parenchyma  \nthroughout the specimen is spongiform tan -red and no residual lesion or  \nabnormality is identified grossly.  3 soft tan -gray tissues in keeping  \nwith lymph nodes ranging from 0.5 -0.9 cm are recovered from the hilum.  \nSummary: 1 - bronchial margin; 2 - vascular margins; 3 through 6 - site \nof staple line; 7 through 9 - random parenchyma; 10 - 3 lymph nodes  \nD.  Received fresh labeled \"R 4\" is a 2.1 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm aggregate of  \nfragmented soft tan- gray tissue admixed with a scant amount of adipose \ntissue.  \n E.  Received fresh labeled \"subcarinal\" are 4 soft tan -gray tissues  \nranging from 0.5 -0.7 cm.  \n \n                                                      \n",
