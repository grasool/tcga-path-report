GROSS DESCRIPTION:
e nay & ureter: Received fresh labeled eft kidney and ureter"" and consists of a 1151 gram
nephrectomy specimen measuring 25 x.15 x 9 an lndud ng dney measuring 22 x 12 x 6 cm and perirenal fat
ranging in thickness from 1 to 6 cm. Extending from the renal pelvis is a ureter (8 x 0.5 cm) renal artery measuring 7x
0.5 cm, and rend vein measuring 0.5 x 1 cm. The renal vein is free of gross abnormality at the margin. The specimen
is received with a surface disruption at the inferior pole and at the lateral aspect of the kidney measuring 6 cm in
greatest dimension through which friable necrotic debris extrudes. The adjacent fat is marked with black ink. In the
mid lower pole and corresponding to the capsular disruption is a well circumscribed predominantly necrotic mass
measuring 15 x 10 x 9 cm. The mass lies 1 cm from the renal vein margin and grossly extends through the renal Page 2 of 2
capsule and perirenal fat at the capsular disruption site. The remainder of the renal cortex is tan-brown with a well
defined corticomedullaryjunction. The pelvis and calyces are covered by smooth glistenin mucosa .The adipose
tissue is thinly sectioned, and no lymph nodes are found .The case is reviewed by , Representative sections
of the specimen are submitted as follows :Al) renal vein, artery and ureter margins en face ;A2-3) capsular
disruption two fragments per cassette ;A4-8) capsule wall, two fragments per cassette ;A9) non- neoplastic kidney;
Al 0) perinephritic fat.
At the request oM the specimen is regrossed with additional sections of the perlhilar blood vessels
submitted in cassettes Al 1-A15 under the direction ot^ ^s
MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
Sections of vascular and ureteral margin tissues do not show a neoplasm .Sections of the grossly described
lesion show a necrotic papillary carcinoma with patchy hemosiderin, and areas of variably foamy cytoplasm. Nuclear
characteristics show areas of prominent nucleoli and irregular nuclear borders. There is associated organizing blood.
Small vessel vascular space invasion is present .Tumor does not a ear to involve renal pelvis or hilar tissues.
Sarcomatoid areas are not seen In the examined sections.

A LEFT KIDNEY
Preop erative Diagnosis
Left renal mass
Gross Description
A. The specimen is received fresh, labeled left kidney"" and consists of a kidney with partial
encapsulated perinephric tissue, 844.0 g, 19.5 x 9.8 x 8.6 cm. The specimen is inked black. The
adrenal gland is not identified.
The cut surfaces exhibit an irregular tumor mass involving the cortex and medulla in the superior,
middle and inferior poles, 8..7 x 7.6 x 7.2 cm- The tumor is variegated, pale tan-pink and soft with
smooth lobulated sections.. Marked fibrotic septation is noted. Neither necrosis, hemorrhage or cystic
degeneration is identified. The tumor invades 90% of the calyceal system and extends to the hilum.
The renal vein, artery and ureter are probe patent, and not Involved by tumor. The tumor does not
appear to invade the renal sinus, nor penetrate through the renal capsule to involve the permephric fat..
The tumor is sharply demarcated from normal parenchyma .Satellite tumor nodules are not present-
The remaining renal parenchyma is pink -tan, smooth and glistening with a well -demarcated
rtico-medullary junction, 1.5 cm thickness- The papillae are blunted. A. segment of attached ureter
is noted (4.5 cm length x 4 mm diameter). The renal artery reveals no significant atherosclerotic
changes- No lymph nodes are identified. Representative sections are submitted in A1-A14 as
labeled:
Al: Mirror image section of tumor for Tissue Procurement Laboratory
Renal vein and artery with ureter resection margin,: tangential

Gross Description
A. Specimen A is received fresh, labeled 'right kidney' and consists of a kidney with moderate
pennephric soft tissue ,462.3 g ,16.5 x 9- 5x 6-7 cm overall dimension -The adr enal.gland is non -intact
and ragged, 3 x 1.5 x 1 cm_ The kidney (12.5 x 6.5 x. 4.5 cm) is firm and inked black. The inferior pole
exhibits an exophytic encapsulated nodule of the lateral aspect ,3..1.x 2 .6x 2.5 cm .Sectioned, the
nodule is pale tan, solid and smooth, with scant necrosis (5%) and focal hemorrhage. The nodule
grossly originates from the parenchyma, and does not penetrate the renal capsule or perinephric tat.
The nodule does not involve the renal pelvis, calices or pelvic fat. The renal artery ,vein and ureter are
not affected by the nodule .Located in the superior and middle pole are several intraparenchymal
cysts, containing clear serous fluid, I to 2.5 cm diameter- The cyst lining is smooth with no papillary
excrescences noted .The papillae are blunted and the cortex is 8 mm thick .An external segment of
ureter is noted (5.4 cm length x 3 mm diameter) and is probe patent .The renal vein is firm with
moderate atherosclerotic changes and appears 40-50% occluded- A 5 mm orange-yellow ovoid
calculus is identified in the renal pelvis. No constrict or dilation of the calices is identified.
Representative sections including all margins are submitted in Al-A10 as labeled:
Al: Resection margin of renal artery, vein and ureter, tangential.
A2T Representative of adrenal gland-

Comment :While the margins of the main specimen are uninvolved ,tumor is seen at the inked surgical margins
surrounding the larger of the pericaval lymph nodes (specimen #2). The tumor is composed of papillary structures with
fibrovascular cores ,which are lined by tumor cells with amphophilic cytoplasm and large ,slightly irregular nuclei with
prominent eosinophilic nucleoli.

SPECIMEN (S) SUBMITTED :GROSS DESCRIPTION
1. Right kidney mass: In formalin labeled ""right kidney mass"" is a 15 x 7.5 x 6.5 cm kidney with abundant attached
perinephric fat weight 1,721 grams in aggregate. There is 3.5 cm ureter extending from the renal hilum. The kidney is
bivalved to reveal an ill defined 8.5 cm in greatest dimension variegated tan-white to red nodular tumor within the
superior pole. On cut section, the tumor grossly appears to possibly extend into the perinephric fat at the superior pole.
The lining of the renal pelvis is grey-white and slightly bosselated. Upon sectioning it appears that the tumor elevates
the urothelium and It is unclear at gross dissection whether the tumor penetrates through the urothelium into the renal
pelvis. The tumor also grossly extends into the renal artery, lying 5mm from the renal artery resection margin. The
remaining renal parenchyma is pale tan-pink with an ill defined corticomedullary junction. There is a small portion of
adrenal gland at the most superior aspect of the specimen with an orange red out surface. The gland grossly does not
appear to be involved by tumor. The perinephric fat is inked black. Representative sections are submitted in eight
cassettes as labeled: A vascular and ureter margins, B tumor to include perinephric fat, C-D tumor to include renal
pelvis, E tumor to include renal artery, F tumor to include uninvolved renal parenchyma, G normal renal parenchyma, H
adrenal gland.
2. Peri-caval node. In formalin labeled ""peri-caval node"" are two nodular tan-pink tissues which measure 3.5 x 3 x 2.3 cm
3.and 2.5 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm. The larger tissue Is inked blue and the smaller tissue is inked black. Sectioning of the larger
tissue reveals a slightly friable and partially cystic tan-pink cut surface containing coagulated blood. Sectioning of the
smaller tissue reveals a partially cystic red-brown cut surface containing coagulated blood. Representative sections are
submited in 4 cassettes as follows: A-B entire smaller tissue ,C-D larger tissue.
Gallbladder :In formalin labeled ""gallbladder"" is a 9.5 x 5 x 2.8 cm intact gallbladder. The serosa is tan-pink and dull.
The cystic duct is 0.3 cm in diameter and patent .The gallbladder wall averages 0.2 cm in thickness. The mucosa is
velvety yellow-red with diffuse yellow stippling within the body. The lumen contains tan-yellow viscous bile and a 2.5 cm
green -black granu,tar cholelith. Representative sections to .include the cystic duct margin (inked black) are submitted in
one cassette.

Justification: The report specifically mentions a right kidney mass, which was surgically removed.

Laterality: Right
Justification: The kidney and subsequent descriptions in the report clearly refer to the right kidney.

Histology: Papillary renal cell carcinoma
Justification: The pathologist's report describes the tumor as being composed of papillary structures with fibrovascular cores, which are lined by tumor cells with amphophilic cytoplasm and large, slightly irregular nuclei with prominent eosinophilic nucleoli. These features are consistent with a papillary renal cell carcinoma.

Stage: pT3a pN1
Justification: The pathologic tumor stage is provided in the report as pT3a pN1, which indicates that the tumor has invaded the perinephric fat and the renal vein, with positive lymph nodes present.

The specimen is received fresh labeled ""right kidneyr! and placed 
in formalin. It consists of a radical nephrectomy specimen 
covered wi~ a mantle oftan-yellow, perirenal adipose tissue 
measuring 23 x 12.5 x 10 em and weighing 1,394 grams. The 
surface shows prominent vasculature and is partially covered on 
the anterior aspect with gray-pink membranous tissue measuring 10 
x 7 em. The ureter measures 9 x 0.5 x 0.4 eni. The anterior side 
of the kidney is coated with black ink and the posterior side 
with green ink. 
On bivalving the specimen, almost the entire kidney is displa.ced 
wjth tan-yellow hemorrhagic tumor with the ex~eption of portions 
of kidney at the inferior and medial aspects. The kidney itself 
measures 13 x 8 x 8 em. Tumor is identified outside the capsule 
at the upper pole of the kidney within the vicinity of the 
adrenal gland within an area measuring 5,5 x 5,5 x 4.5 em.

Right renal mass. 
Gross Description 
Received in formalin and labeled ""right kidney"" is a kidney surfaced by a moderate amount of perirenal fat 
which together total 399 gm. Trimmed of fat the kidney is 133 gm, 9.3 x 5.8 x 3.8 cm. Arising from the 
renal pelvis is a 7.8 cm in length and 0.6 em in diameter segment of ureter, a 2.2 cm in length and 1 em in 
diameter segment of renal artery, and a 1.2 cm in length and 0.8 cm in diameter segment of renal vein. No 
lymph nodes are identified in the renal pelvis and no adrenal gland tissue is identified within the perirenal 
fat. The kidney is purple-brown with a faint lobulated appearance. On the inferior pole there is a 3.5 em in 
diameter spherical nodule with a yellow-tan coloration. In this area the capsule is inked black. The cut 
surface identifies a 5.5 x 3.5 x 3.5 cm mottled yellow-tan tumor mass with focal areas of hemorrhagic 
necrosis and white fibrous areas up to 1.2 cm in maximum diameter. In addition, there are cystic structures 
from 0.1 to 1 cm in diameter. Grossly, the tumor mass extends to the renal capsule but does not penetrate 
the capsule. In addition, the tumor extends into the vein ofthe renal pelvis. The remaining renal 
parenchyma is red-brown. The surface of the cortex exhibits broad-based scars up to 1.6 cm in diameter. 
In addition, there are renal retention cysts from 0.2 to 0.8 cm. The renal cortex averages 0.5 cm in 
thickness and the medulla averages 1.2 cm. No other masses or indurated areas are grossly identified. 
Summary of sections: 1 -surgical margins of the ureter, renal artery and renal vein, 2-4 -tumor mass and 
renal capsule, 5-6 -tumor mass and renal pelvis, 7 -representative section of renal parenchyma with scar, 
8 -representative section of renal parenchyma with renal retention cysts, 9-11 tumor within segmental

The ureteral margin and vascular margins are submitted in 
block two. The ureteropelvic junction is submitted in block 
two. The lesion pushes against the capsular membrane but 
does not appear to involve it. The mass and capsule are 
sampled in block's four through six. The capsule strips 
easily from the surface of the kidney. No additional areas 
of lesion are grossly identified. The cortex averages 1.5 
cm thickness. The calices are not dilated. Representative 
sections of normal appearing kidney are submitted in block's

attached perinephric fat that measures 14.0 x B.O x 7.0 em and weighs 365 gm. There is no adrenal gland attached. The ureter stump measures 4.0 em 
in length and 0.3 em in diameter and is grossly unremarkable. The renal artery stump measures 1.5 ern in length and 0.5 em in diameter and is 
unremarkable. The renal vein stump measures 1.5 em in length and 0.5 em in diameter and 15 grossly unremarkable. On sectioning, there reveals a 
circumscrioed, golden yellow mass within the lower pole that measures 3.7 x 3.0 em that Is beneath the capsular surface. The mass does not appear to 
penetrate through the capsule into the surrounding perinephric fat The surrounding cortex is brown-tan and measures 0.7 em and shows a well 
demarcated renal cortex and pyramid junction. Representative sections were taken for genomic studies and placed in orange cassettes labeled A ---""------ .f""

2. ""Laterality"": Not applicable, as the report is related to a unilateral organ.
3. ""Histology"": Clear cell adenocarcinoma, as stated in the diagnosis and tumor characteristics section.
4. ""Stage"": T2, as the tumor extends to the capsule but does not invade through it (no T3 or T4) and no metastasis is mentioned (no M1). N0 can be assumed since lymphovascular invasion is not reported (N1 would indicate positive nodes, NX would indicate nodes not assessed).
5. ""Grade"": Fuhrman grade 2-3 (based on the report of a nuclear grade of 214), which corresponds to Grade II or III differentiation. Since the exact correlation between the Fuhrman grade and the four-tier grading system is not straightforward, I've provided a range.

 Received in formalin is a kidney with attached perirenal adipose 
tissue and adrenal glands. The specimen weighs 1,204 grams and measures 24.0 
x 15.0 x 7.0 em in overall dimensions. The kidney measures 11,0 cm from 
. superior to inferior, 8.5 cm from medial to lateral, and 4.5 em from anterior 
to posterior. The kidney weighs 350 grams. Located at the hilum is a 1.3 cm 
in length x 0.4 cm in diameter portion of artery which is adjacent to a 
portion of renal vein which is bifurcated and measures 2.0 cm in length x 0.3 
cm in diameter. The ureter measures 10.0 em in length x 0.2 em in diameter. 
The external surface consists of a large amount of bosselated tan-yellow 
perirenal adipose tissue. On sectioning, a fairly well circumscribed mass is 
identified within the lower pole which measures 5.5 x 4.0 x 4.0 cm in overall 
dimension. The cut surface consists of soft, diffusely congested, red golden 
yellow tissue with scattered irregular, gray-tan, cystic areas. The solid 
tissue comprises approximately 60% of the cut surface and the cystic portion 
40%. The lesion lies subjacent to the renal pelvis and shows possible focal 
extension into the adjacent hilar fat. This focal extension is located 
adjacent to a portion of the renal artery. The mass involves 50% of the lower 
pole and also shows irregular satellite lesions composed of soft golden 
yellow-red tissue which range in size from 0.2 to 0.8 cm in greatest 
dimension. The mass is located 4.0 em from the renal artery/renal vein 
margin. The mass measures 1.0 cm from the radial soft tissue margin. The 
capsule surrounding the mass strips with ease. The remainder of the renal 
parenchyma is pink-brown with a distinct corticomedullary junction. The 
cortex measures 0.5 cm in thickness and the medulla measures 1.2 cm in 
thickness. The cortical surface is pink-tan, smooth and glistening. The

by a moderate amount of Gerotas fascia. The specimen as received 
weighs 1320 grams and on reconstruction measures 25.6 x 14.0 x 8.5 
em. In the anterior superior medial aspect is a 5.1 x 2.4 x 1.0 em 
recognizable adrenal gland which on sectioning has a bright yellow 
cortex surrounding a hyalinized tan gray medulla. The cortex has an 
eccentric 0.7 em bright yellow chalky appearing nodule through the 
cortex in the central portion of the specimen. The margins of 
resection include 0.7 cm of grossly patent renal artery, 0.8 cm of 
grossly patent renal vein and 9.8 cm of grossly patent ureter. The 
capsule strips with slight difficulty to reveal to an organ measuring 
12.8 x 7.0 x 6.0 cm. The cortex is lobulated, slightly pale tan 
brown. The cortex measures up to 1.0 cm and is slightly granular and 
tan brown. The corticomedullary junction is poorly defined. The 
medulla is gray brown and slightly hyalinized with focal blunting of 
the papillae. The calices and pelvis at the upper pole are grossly 
distorted by the presence of a 7.8 x 6.5 x 6.2 cm lobulated tan gray

grossly patent renal vein, and 9.8 ern of grossly patent ureter. The 
capsule strips with ease to reveal an organ measuring 11.4 x 7.2 x 
5.6 em. This has a lobulated finely granular red brown cortical 
surface. The specimen is previously sectioned in the low posterior 
pole to reveal an eccentric 2.7 x 2.5 x 2.2 em well circumscribed 
thinly encapsulated chalky gray yellow to brown focally hemorrhagic 
lesion. On sectioning this lesion has a tan pink to yellow focally 
hemorrhagic cut surface but appears grossly confined to the capsule. 
This grossly appears to focally extend to within 0.1 em of the 
cortical margin; however, the lesion does not appear to extend beyond 
the capsule into the cortex. The surrounding parenchyma is slightly

Received in a single container labeled I -left kidney"" is 
a previously bisected 1040 gram left nephrectomy specimen surrounded 
by a large amount of perinephric adipose tissue and faced anteriorly 
by a moderate amount of Gerota's fascia. The specimen on 
reconstruction measures 24.0 x 13.8 x 9.8 em. The margins of 
resection include 1.5 em of grossly patent renal artery, 1.3 ern of 
grossly patent renal vein and 7.0 em of grossly patent ureter. The 
capsule strips \1i th ease to reveal an organ measuring 12.4 x 8.5 x 
6.9 cm on reconstruction. There is a lobulated slightly pale 
red-brown slightly granular cortex. The cortex measures up to 1.0 em 
and is slightly granular red-brown. The corticomedullary junction is 
poorly defined. The medulla is red-brOl<n ""Iith sharp papillae. The 
calyces and pelvis are lined by smooth gray-white mucosa extending 
into the ureter. Noted on the posterior aspect extending into the 
hilus is a well-defined 5.2 x 4.8 x 4.5 cm thinly encapsulated 
gray-tan to yellow nodule with a friable focally chalky, focally 
hemorrhagic gray-yellow to brown cut surface. The capsule appears 
grossly in~act. This lesion grossly extends beyond the plane of the 
kidney into the surrounding adipose tissue; hOi-leVer I the capsule does 
not appear to be grossly transected. The lower pole calyx immediately 
adjacent to the lesion is dilated with a 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm granular 
brOl-m-black calculus within the calyx. The lesion further appears to 
compress hilar adipose tissue and structures but does not grossly 
appear to extend into them. On further sectioning this parenchyma 
reveals a second slightly dilated lower pole calyx which has a 0.4 x 
0.3 x 0.2 cm similar gray-brown to black calculus. Within the 
parenchyma adjacent to these dilated calyces there is a 0.4 x 0.4 x

HISTORY
Renal mass
(StageIV chronic kidney diseasewith history of renal transplant)
GROSS
Received fresh in a container labeled left kidney"" is a kidney with
a moderate amount of attached perinephric fat (12.5 x 8 x 4.8 cm).
The kidney by itself (9.5 x 3.8 x 3.2 cm), weighs 78 grams. Hilar
vessels are up to 0.8 cm long, 2.5 cm in diameter. The renal vein
lumen is widely patent. The attached ureter (2.5 cm long, 0.4 cm in
diameter) has a metal clip across the lumen adjacent to the margin.
The inferior pole of the kidney has a 4 cm in diameter discrete
tumor nodule with a mottled, spongy orange gray cut surface.
Scattered areasof hemorrhage are present throughout. The tumor has
a discrete pushing margin, which produces a bulge in the overlying
intact capsule. Extension into the adjacent perinephric fat is not
apparent. The overlying adventitia margin is marked with black ink.
Superiorly, the tumor margin is within 0.2 cm of the renal sinus
fat.Direct extension into perinephric fat is not apparent. The
remaining renal parenchyma has athin, atrophic firm tan cortex (up
to 0.5 cm thick) and numerous cortical cysts containing clear fluid
and old, brown'blood. Renal pyramids are atrophic. Major and minor
calices along with the renal pelvis are lined by mildly striated
gray-white mucosa.

FINAL SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT
Renal mass
Gross Description:
The specimen is labeled left kidney and is received in formalin. It consists of a nephrectomy specimen
which together with perinephric fat weighs 446 grams. It measures 17.5 cm from superior to inferior, 9 cm
from medial to lateral, and 4.5 cm from anterior to posterior. Along the medial-superior edge of the
perinephric fat there is a intact appearing 6.5 x 3.5 x 1 cm portion of adrenal gland. Along the anterior
surface of the kidney there Is a thin delicate membranous tissue consistent with Gerota 's fascia
approximately measuring 10 x 5 cm. The central-lateral surface of the nephrectomy specimen is torn and
disrupted exposing the cortical surface of the kidney which Is bulging .Serial sections of the adrenal gland
reveal no gross evidence of tumor involvement. At the hilum of the kidney the renal artery and renal vein
are identified. The vessels are opened and there is no gross evidence of intraluminal tumor. Extending
from the hilum of the kidney is a small caliber portion of ureter which is 6.5 cm in length and 0.3 cm In
diameter. The ureter is opened to the renal pelvis to reveal the urothelium Is tan-white and smooth and
unremarkable. Sectioning through the central-lateral surface of the kidney reveals a well circumscribed
golden yellow and thinly capsulated appearing neoplasm which overall measures 3.3 x 3.2 x 2.8 cm. This
neoplasm abuts the cortical surface of the kidney but grossly does not appear to extend through the renal
capsule Into the small amount of adherent perirenal adipose tissue .The neoplasm Is 3.5 cm from the
hilum and hilar vascuiature. There is some cautery and cavitation of the renal parenchyma just along the
superior edge of the tumor suggestive of surgical manipulation .There is some hemorrhage extending
into the hilar fat. The kidney away from the neoplasm has a normal reddish brown appearance and the
cortical medullary junction appears distinct. The cortical thickness is 0.7 cm. Close sectioning of the
remainder of the kidney reveals no additional masses. The perinephric adipose tissue is dissected but no
lymph nodes are identified grossly. Also in the specimen container is an additional 7.5 cm aggregate of
lobulated fatty tissue which is serially sectioned and palpably unremarkable. Representative sections of
the tumor are obtained for research purposes. Following fixation the sections are submitted as
summarized below: Section summary: Al) surgical margin, renal artery, renal vein and ureter, A2)
adrenal gland, A3) additional sections of ureter and ureteral pelvic junction, A4) Gerota's fascia, A5-A7)
sections of central-lateral tumor and cortical surface of kidney, A7-A8) sections of tumor and immediately
adjacent renal tissue. Additional section of tumor adjacent to the renal sinus was submitted in Al 0, and
an additional section of renal artery and renal vein are submitted in cassette Al 1.^

COMMENTS: 
Histologic sections from the left kidney show a unifocal tumor mass measuring 3.0 em in greatest dimension . Grossly the tumor appears to be limited to 
the kidney. However, there is an area in which there is microscopic transgression of the renal capsule with tumor extending approximately 0.1 cm into the 
perinephric adipose tissue. The tumor is not identified at the margins of resection. The tumor shows a papillary pattern consisting of polygonal to 
columnar shaped cells with enlarged oval nuclei and prominent nucleoli. Numerous clusters of macrophages are present within the papillary stalks. The 
histoloaic aopearance is that of papillary renal cell carcinoma.  .~ """" .

Clinical History/Operative Ox: 
Left renal pelvic tumor 
Gross Description: 
The specimen is labeled left kidney and ureter and is received without fixative. It consists of a 
nephrectomy specimen with adherent long segment of ureter which weighs   The nephrectomy 
specimen measures 14 cm from superior to inferior, 7.5 cm from medial to lateral, and 5 cm from anterior 
to posterior. There is no grossly identifiable adrenal gland tissue. Along the anterior surface of the kidney 
is a 8 x 5.5 cm area of thin delicate adherent tissue suggestive of Gerota's fascia. At the hilum the renal 
artery and renal vein are identified. The vessels are opened and show no gross evidence of intraluminal 
tumor. Extending from the hilum of the kidney is a 26 cm segment of ureter which proximally and 
centrally has a diameter of 0.5 cm, up to 0.6 cm at the distal end. A yellow plastic stent is present in the 
lumen of the ureter. The ureter is opened and the urothelium is tan and smooth. At the pelvis friable 
tumor is present in the renal pelvis arising from the central calix. The kidney is bivalved to reveal a finely 
granular tan-white neoplasm occupying the superior pole calix and extending into the middle pole calix. 
This neoplasm overall measures 3.7 x 3.2 x 3.2 cm. It is approximately 1 cm from Gerota's fascia and 1.5 
cm from the renal hilar vascular margin. It involves the upper pole and central pole calices. The inferior 
pole calix appears uninvolved. The renal parenchyma is otherwise reddish brown and cortical thickness is 
0.6 cm. There are no obvious lymph nodes in the perinephric adipose tissue. Representative sections are

Gross Description: 
A. The specimen is labeled left kidney mass and is received without fixative. It consists of a cortical 
portion of kidney which overall measures 3.3 x 3.1 x 2.9 cm and  The cortical surface of 
the kidney appears smooth with intact renal capsule. The surgical margin is inked. The specimen is 
serially sectioned to reveal a well circumscribed mass measuring 2.5 x 2.5 x 1.8 cm. This mass is variably 
composed of pale tan to granular reddish and hemorrhagic tissue. It abuts the cortical surface but there is 
no overlying perirenal fat. It is grossly 0.5 cm from the closest cortical resection margin. Representative 
sections of this neoplasm are obtained for research purposes. Also in the specimen container is a 4 cm 
aggregate of lobulated fatty tissue which is serially sectioned and contains no obvious tumor. 
Representative sections are submitted. Section summary: A1-A4) renal neoplasm and cortical resection 
margin, A5) peripheral section of neoplasm and representative separate fatty tissue.
8. The specimen is labeled prostate and is received in formalin. It consists of a prostatectomy specimen 
which  The prostate gland measures 3.7 x 3.5 x 3.4 cm and includes a partially 
disrupted 2.5 x 1.5 x 0.7 cm right seminal vesicle, a 1.7 cm segment of right vas deferens, a 1.7 cm 
segment of left vas deferens, and a short but intact appearing 1.8 x 1.3 x 0.9 cm left seminal vesicle. The 
right anterior surface of the prostate is inked blue, the left anterior surface is inked green, and the posterior 
surface is inked black. The prostatic apex, bladder neck, and seminal vesicle / vasa are trimmed. The 
prostate is divided into right and left halves and is sectioned from apex to bladder neck. The right apical 
portion of the prostate anteriorly displays pale yellow-tan discoloration in two discrete foci, each 0.7 cm in 
maximum dimensions. One of these areas is just adjacent to the apical portion of the prostate and the 
other is located in the mid gland. The prostatic gland parenchyma throughout the left prostate is spongy 
tan and fibrous. Representative sections are submitted. Section summary: 81) right prostatic apex, 82) left 
prostatic apex, 83) right bladder neck, 84) left bladder neck, 85) surgical margin right vas deferens, right 
seminal vesicle, 86) surgical margin left vas deferens, left seminal vesicle, 87-824) prostate, apex­

Microscopic Description 
Sections include kidney with a sharply circumscribed, partially encapsulated 
epithelial neoplasm. The neoplasm is characterized by a predominantly solid or 
tubular growth pattern with foci of micropapillary or papilliform architecture. 
The predominant tumor cell is a small cuboidal cell with uniform, round, small 
bland nucleus and modest amounts of predominantly clear cytoplasm. There is a 
second cell population present in the lumina of the tubules. The luminal 
population consists of larger polygonal cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and a 
single, slightly enlarged oval to reniform nucleus with granular chromatin and a 
small nucleolus. The latter cells form intral~minal poorly cohesive sheets. 
There are scattered foci of foamy macrophages within the interstitium of the 
tumor. Focally the tumor extends through its thin fibrous capsule and 
infiltrates into native renal parenchyma in a broad front. Focally tumor abuts 
on an inked parenchymal resection margin (black ink, A2). In the histologic 
sections convincing extrarenal extension into perinephric soft tissue is not 
identified. 
A PAS stain is applied to sections of uninvolved nonneoplastic kidney (A7). It 
demonstrates very focal mild interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy with rare 
colocalized ischemic sclerotic glomeruli. The glomeruli are unremarkable. 
Neither crescents nor mesangial proliferation nor primary glomerulopathy is 
seen.

node. The cut surface is homogenous tan-pink. The node is sectioned and entirely submitted labeled 
Specimen C, received fresh from the OR labeled left kidney, consists of the following: 
Procedure/specimen type: Radical nephrectomy. 
Specimen laterality: Left. 
Pe$cription of specimen: The 726 gm kidney with associated perinephric fat measures overall 19.0 x 14.0 x 7.0 
cm. Gerota's fascia is hemorrhagic with fibrous adhesions. Gerota's fascia is fibrotic and 
thickened measuring up to 0.5 cm. The perinephric fat is firm and lobulated measuring up 
to 2.0 cm in thickness. Blue ink is applied to Gerota's fascia and the mass grossly 
appears to abut the fascia. The attached segment of ureter measures 4.0 cm in length 
with an internal diameter of 0.3 cm and is grossly unremarkable and not involved by the 
tumor. 
The kidney measures 12.0 x 6.5 x 5.5 cm. The kidney is surrounded by a large cystic 
hemorrhagic mass containing blood clot. The mass is attached to the kidney and grossly 
involves the renal parenchyma superiorly. Sections show a soft tan expansile solid area 
within the cystic mass abutting the surface of the kidney and slightly compressing the 
renal parenchyma. 
The renal pelvis is slightly displaced. The corticomedullary junction within the superior 
pole of the kidney is pale white-pink and compressed. Within the superior pole of the 
kidney is a portion of attached adrenal gl,md measuring 3.0 x 3.0 x 0.3 cm. The adrenal

COMMENT: Immunohistochemical staining is positive for OSCAR-CK, CK7, racemase, 
and CD10. It is negative for CK20 and CD117. This supports the given diagnosis. 
COMMENT: Tumor extends to the parenchymal edge of specimen A. From pathologic 
examination alone, it is not possible to determine with certainty whether or not the 
portions of the parenchymal edge of specimen A which are involved by tumor are true 
margins or only ""specimen margins"" in which specimen B is the true surgical margin. 
Specimen B is negative for malignancy. Additionally, a substantial portion of tumor is 
less than 0.1 cm from the parenchymal edge of specimen A; this area appears 
significantly larger than the aggregate size of all the tissue in specimen B. The margin 
status in this report was given following telephone conversation with  
who stated that the pertinent specimen for establishing the margin in 
question (parenchymal margin) is specimen B.

SPECIMEN/GROSS DESCRIPTION 
SOURCE: Left partial kidney nephrectomy 
The specimen is received fresh from the OR labeled ""left partial 
nephrectomy."" It consists of a 49 gram, 4.7 x 4.3 x 4.3 cm rubbery ovoid 
wedge renal parenchyma. The intact, smooth capsular surface with thin fatty 
adhesions is inked blue and the predominantly smooth, focally coarse 
resection margin is inked black. The tissue is serially cross sectioned and 
the cut surfaces display a 4.3 x 4 x 4 cm tumor bulging the capsule and 
located less than 0.1 cm from the black inked margin. A representative 
section of the margin is frozen on one block. 
INTRAOPERATIVE PATHOLOGY CONSULTATION WITH FROZEN SECTION: ""Papillary renal 
cell carcinoma forming a 4.3 cm greatest dimension tumor, .om letely 
excised. Margin is negative for malignancy."" is rendered by -The cut surfaces of the tumor are yellow, tan, red, variegated and vaguely 
lobulated with a thin fibrous capsule. The tumor constitutes at least 90% 
of the specimen volume. The scant renal parenchyma at the periphery of the 
margin is grossly unremarkable. 
Representative sections to include all of the closest black inked renal 
margin are submitted in nine cassettes as follows: 
1. Frozen section residue

FINAL SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT
Kidney;Left
Clinical History/Operative Dx•
Renal mass
Gross Description:
The specimen is labeled left kidney and is received without fixative. It consists of a nephrectomy specimen
which together perinephric fat weighs 627 grams. It measures 20 cm from superior to inferior, 10 cm from
medial to lateral, and 9 cm from anterior to. posterior. Along the anterior surface there is lobulated fatty
tissue and there is a bulging fluctuant mass at the inferior pole of the kidney. At the hilum the renal artery
and renal vein are identified. The vessels are opened and show no gross evidence of intraluminal tumor.
Extending from the hilum of the kidney there is an 8 cm segment of ureter which appears somewhat
attenuated. The ureter is opened to reveal smooth tan-white urothelium. The kidney is bivalved to reveal
a fluid filled cystic mass in the inferior pole which bulges anteriorly this cystic mass measures 6 x 8 x 52
cm. It contains amorphous brown material and turbid fluid. The lining of the cyst Is brown with patchy
small areas of yellow discoloration. The cyst is 1.3 cm from the hitum of the kidney. It appears contained
within the renal capsule and is separated from the anterior surface of the kidney by a thin layer of smooth
fascial tissue. Representative sections of the mass are obtained for research purposes. The remaining
kidney has pale red parenchyma and normal appearing medullary rays. Cortical thickness is 0.8 cm. There
are scattered fluid filled cysts within the cortical portion of the kidney which are up to 1.3 cm. No other
discrete masses are present. Serial sections of the perineural adipose tissue reveal no grossly obvious
lymph nodes and no identifiable adrenal tissue. Representative sections are submitted.
Section summary:
Al) surgical margin, renal artery, renal vein and ureter,
A2) additional sections of ureter and ureteral pelvic junction,
A3) anterior surface of lower pole kidney including possible Gerota's fascia,
A4-A6) additional representative sections of cyst,
A7) cyst and closest approach to hilum,
AB) uninvolved kidney.

COMMENTS:
Sections of the adrenal gland demonstrate adrenal cortical hyperplasia with extensive hemorrhage and focal necrosis within the medullary component A
single nodule of clear cell proliferation which is well vascularized is noted and because of the histologic features immunohistochemical stains are
performed With the following results
RCC: Positive.
cola Positive.
Vimentin :Positive.
Based on the immunohistochemical results and the H&E findings the f e a t u r e s of the adrenal nodule are m o s t consistent with those o f metastatic rena€ a
carcinoma.

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:
Sections of the grossly identified renal tumor show
carcinoma with papillary morphology. The tumor is
characterized by multinodular growth and tumor cells with
moderately pleomorphic medium to large oval nuclei with
occasional nuclear grooves and ample eosinophilic to
vacuolated cytoplasm. In areas the papillary formations are
densely packed'and essentially solid. There is multifocal
intratumoral hemosiderin and formation of cystic nodules
filled with papillary tumor and blood. Tumor abuts the
fibrous renal capsule, but does not clearly invade perirenal
fat on multiple levels examined. There is invasion of small
non-muscularized veins in the renal sinus but no definitive
invasion of the renal sinus fat or large branches of the
renal vein.
The tumor is associated with a significant and extensive
diffuse and nodular lymphocytic infiltrate at the periphery
of the lesion that also extensively involve perinephric and
renal sinus fat, and show sheets and nodules of cells
extensively involve the remaining non-carcinomatous renal
cortex. These are monomorphic-appearing small lymphocytes,
and by immunohistochemistry are diffusely positive for CD20
and BCL-2. The same B cells are negative for CD5 and CD23,
which highlights residual germinal center dendritic cells.
CD3 and CD5 show staining in a smaller population of T
lymphocytes. BCL-6 and cyclin D1 are negative.
Sections of the omental nodule show a spherical accessory
spleen with relatively normal splenic architecture and small
periarterial lymphoid nodules. The adipose tissue
surrounding the splenule is involved by dense sheets and
nodules of the same lymphoid infiltrate with identical immunophenotype to the kidney. Thel eft pelvic lymph node
shows involvement by both metastatic papillary carcinoma and
the same abnormal lymphoid population, with near complete
effacement of residual normal nodal architecture in the

non-carcinomatous areas. Positive and negative control
slides are appropriate.
DIAGNOSIS BASED ON GROSS AND MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:
A. Kidney, left, radical nephrectomy:
- Papillary renal cell carcinoma (histologic type 2), 5.5 cm
in greatest dimension.
- Carcinoma is confined to the kidney, without invasion of
renal sinus fat, muscularized branches of the renal vein, or
perinephric fat.
- Carcinoma shows invasion of small non-muscularized vessels
in renal sinus.
- Small B-cell lymphoma most consistent with extranodal
marginal zone lymphoma, with diffuse involvement of kidney,
perinephric fat, and renal sinus.
- Ureter, vascular, and soft tissue resection margins are
negative for carcinoma.
- See
B. Omentum, excisional biopsy of mass:
- Accessory spleen, with surrounding adipose tissue involved
by small B-cell lymphoma.
C. Lymph node, left pelvic, excision:
- One lymph node, involved by both metastatic papillary
renal cell carcinoma and small B-cell lymphoma.

ADDENDUM REPORT:
This addendum i s issued to clarify the surgical margins status. This case was discussed with Dr. Per Dr.
the specimen submitted as deep margin (8) was taken from the left lateral tumor (specimen C).The left lateral tumor is not transec ted in the histologic
sections examined .Multiple satellite foci (greater than 10) are noted in the renal parenchyma surrounding the three main lesions in specimen C-E. Some
of these satellite lesions measure less than 1 mm. Therefore it is possible that the deep margin tumor in specimen B represents a separate focus of
tumorrather than a positive margin from the left lateral tumor since the left lateral tumor was not transacted.A conversation with Dr also
reveals that the upper pole tumor ( 0) was adherent to the specimen submitted as left cyst wall (A). The upper pole tumor showed a ►+ a►ea of capsular
retraction with ink focally extending to the tumor .This additional information from Dr. lakes it likely that this area of concern was the site of the
adherent cyst and therefore does not represent a true margin.
in summary, no tumor transection is noted ,however ,this patient is at increased risk for recurrence due to the numerous small satellite lesions noted.

Electronic signature: Histologic sections show numerous foci of papillary renal cell carcinoma .Each of the resections including the left lateral ,upper pole, and lower poles
excisions demonstrate a dominant primary tumor with multiple smaller foci within the adjacent renal parenchyma .The separately submitted deep margin(specimen B )also demonstrates similar morphology consistent with papillary renal cell carcinoma. The cyst wall Is negative for tumor.
Specimen 0 (upper pole tumor )demonstrates tumor extending to the inked outer /capsular surface ,however the capsule appears to have retracted in this
area and the presence of ink at the tumor is interpreted as a retraction artifact and not a true positive capsular/soft tissue margin.

and middle. However, no gross invasion is found. Representative sections 
of the tumor are submitted for frozen section consultation in 1FS. The 
second lesion is found in the mid lateral aspect of the kidney and 
measures 1.4 x 1.4 x 1.2 em and is orangish-brown in color and soft. This 
lesion is 2 em from the above mentioned mass. Further sectioning through 
the supe1ior pole discloses an ill-defined circumscribed potential lesion

CYTOGENETIC ANALYSIS REPORTS 
KARYOTYPE: 
Abnormal mosaic  karyotype: 44,X,-Y,-1,+7,-14,+20,-21[8]/46,XY[12) 
RESULTS: 
The renal mass was sent to a commercial laboratory for cytogenetic 
analysis. 
The chromosomes from the cells of nine-and ten-day adherent cultures were 
counted and analyzed, and two of these metaphases were karyotyped by G­
banding. Eight cells had a modal chromosome number of 44 and were 
characteiized by the loss of chromosomes Y, 1, 14, and 21 and gain of 
chromosomes 7 and 20. Twelve cells had a modal chromosome number of 
46 and appem·ed to have a normal karyotype. Cytogenetic abnormalities 
involving the numeiicalloss of chromosomes Y and 1, often without 
additional changes, have been reported in renal oncocytomas.

Gross Description: Received fresh for frozen section diagnosis is a kidney 
with attached perinephric fat weighing 1988.28 gm and measming 24 x 14.5 
x 11.5 em. Examination of the hilum reveals the vascular resection 
margins. Grossly, the ureter appears to insert in the region of the lower 
pole. The venous resection margin appears to be free of tumor; however, 
upon opening the vein, adherent tumor thrombus is identified. No tumor is 
present at the resection margin itself. Bivalving the kidney reveals a 
large, yellow-orange and hemorrhagic tumor occupying the majority of the 
kidney. There is some recognizable renal parenchyma identified in the 
lower pole of the kidney. The tumor measures approximately 12 x 9.5 x 9 
em. A representative section of the tumor is submitted for frozen section 
analysis. The frozen residue will be submitted for pe1manent analysis. A 
section of the tumor is submitted for cytogenetic analysis. Sectioning 
through the remainder of the specimen reveals tumor invading into 
perinephric fat, grossly 2 mm from the inked margin. An adrenal gland is 
identified measuring approximately 9 x 2 x 0.5 em. There is a nodule 
within the adrenal measuring 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.3 em. The specimen is 
dissected for lymph nodes and possible lymph nodes are submitted.

KARYOTYPE: Abnmmal karyotype: 42-44,XY,-6,-8[cp5] 
RESULTS: The renal mass was sent to a commercial laboratory for 
cytogenetic analysis. Only five 111etaphases were available for chromosome 
count and analysis, and two of these metaphases were karyotyped by 
G-banding. All five cells were abnmmal with loss of chromosomes 6 and 8. 
The karyotype description is a composite, listing only the consistent 
clonal changes. Loss of chromosomes 6 and 8 has been reported in a 
variety of renal tumors including renal cell carcinoma and renal sarcoma.

(membranous staining), many cells positive for CK7, and weakly positive 
for Vimentin, whereas negative for.CDlO, CK903, and CD117 (only 
cytoplasmic staining). Special stain colloidal iron shows many cells with 
strong, granular cytoplasmic staining. Mucicarmine special stain is 
negative. Differential diagnosis includes low grade chromophobe carcinoma

Addendum Diagnosis 
The cytogenetic analysis (  reveals a normal karyotype. 
The histomorphology is that of an atypical oncocytoma, however, foci of 
the tumor are strongly positive for colloidal iron, and many cells are 
positive for CK7. Thus, an oncocytic neoplasm with low malignant 
potential is favored, which is a borderline neoplasm between oncocytoma 
and chromophobe carcinoma.

DIAGNOSIS: Right Renal Mass 
KARYOTYPE: Abnonnal  karyotype: 46,Y,t(X;l)(p11.2;p34)[cp21] 
RESULTS: The renal mass was harvested after seven and nine days in 
culture. The chromosomes from 21 metaphases were counted and analyzed, 
 and three of these metaphases were karyotyped by G-banding. The modal 
chromosome number was 46, and all the cells had a balanced translocation 
between the p arms of chromosomes X and 1. This translocation juxtaposed 
the TFE3 gene at Xpl1.2 with the PSF gene at 1 p34. The expression of the 
resulting fusion gene, PSF-TFE3, in renal epithelial cells has been 
repotted to play a role in the development of renal cell carcinoma (please 
see the addendum to the Surgical Pathology Report). "," Site: Right kidney and adrenal gland
Laterality: Right
Histology: Renal cell carcinoma with clear cell and papillary patterns, X;1 translocation
Stage: pT2, no lymph node involvement (N0), metastasis not detected (Mx)
Grade: Not provided
Behavior: Malignant

Justification: The tissue was labeled as ""hernia sac"" but further examination revealed a renal cell carcinoma with clear cell and papillary patterns, along with a translocation between chromosomes X and 1.

The patient is a 64-year-old male who presented with a right upper lobe lung mass. A CT-guided biopsy was performed. Histologically, the tumor consists of crowded, atypical cells arranged in solid sheets and nests with focal necrosis. The tumor cells have moderate amounts of eosinophilic cytoplasm and vesicular nuclei with prominent nucleoli. The mitotic count is 5 per high power field. Immunohistochemical stains show the tumor cells to be positive for TTF-1, Napsin A, and p40. The tumor measures 3.2 cm in greatest dimension. No lymphovascular or pleural invasion is identified.

RESULTS: The renal mass was harvested after seven and eight days in 
culture. The chromosomes from twenty metaphases were counted and 
analyzed, and three of these metaphases were karyotyped by G-banding. The 
modal chromosome number was 52, and all of the cells had an abnotmal

each of chromosomes 3, 10, 12, 16, 17, and 20, two extra copies of 
chromosome 7, and a missing chromosome 21  chromosome. Papillary 
renal adenomas and carcinomas have been reported to contain a unique 
 combination of autosomal trisomies along with loss of chromosome. 
The constellation of trisomies includes chromosomes 7, 12, 16, 17, and 20, 
all of which are found in this patient' s karyotype. The literature 
suggests that tumors with tri-or tetrasomy 7 and 17 correspond to

GROSS DESCRIPTION 
The specimen is submitted fresh as ""left kidney and ureter"" and consists 
of a kidney removed with attached perirenal fat weighing 361 grams with an 
overall dimension of 19 x 11 x 5 em. The kidney measures 10 x 6 x 3.5 ern. 
The segment of attached ureter measures 8 ern in length and 0.6 em in 
diameter. There are several segments of vessel at the hilum ranging in 
length from 0.4 to 1.5 em in length and measuring up to 2 em in diameter. 
The ureteral mucosa is pale tan with the usual striations. The pelvic 
mucosa is similar in appearance. The renal parenchyma is red brown with 
normal architecture. There is a 2 x 2.2 x 1.5 em circumscribed yellow tan 
tumor adjacent to the renal pelvis which appears to abut upon the 
renal sinus and approaches to within 0.5 em of the cortical surface. The 
calyces are not dilated. The cortex measures up to 0.8 em in thickness. 
The capsule strips easily revealing an underlying red brown granular 
cortical surface. Examination of the attached perirenal fat is 
unrem0rkable. The adrenal gland is absent. Representative sections are 
submitted, multiple (9) labeled as follows:·~-

NEPHRECTOMY
The specimen is submitted fresh as ""left kidney"" and consists of a kidney
removed with attached adrenal gland and segment of ureter. The specimen
has an overall dimension of 20 x 13 x 5 cm and a weight of 567 grams. The
isolated kidney measures 12.5 x 5.5 x 5 cm. The capsule is removed with
ease revealing a pink tan granular surface interrupted by a 4 x 3 x 2.5 cm
serous cyst at the upper pole. There are two ligated vessels at the hilum
ranging in length from 0.7 to 1.5 cm in length and measuring 0.6 and 0.4
cm in diameter respectively. The segment of attached ureter measures 7 cm
in length and 0.3 cm in diameter at the margin of resection. The ureter
and pelvis are red tan and glistening. Upon opening, the ureteral mucosa
is pink tan with the usual striations. The pelvic mucosa is pink tan and
unremarkable. Adjacent to the capsular cyst at the lower portion of the
upper is a moderately firm red-yellow, focally hemorrhagic, relatively
circumscribed tumor measuring 2 x 2.7 x 2.2 cm which extends to the rim of
the cortex and protrudes into the surrounding perirenal fat. The tumor
does not grossly invade the subjacent pelvis. The remaining renal
parenchyma is pink tan and unremarkable. The cortex measures 0.8 cm in
maximum thickness.
The attached adrenal gland measures 7 x 2 x 1.5 cm and weighs 7 grams.
There is no gross involvement by tumor. Examination of the attached
perirenal fat is unremarkable. No grossly apparent nodes are seen.

COMMENT: 
The tumor is composed of two histological patterns: the typical chromophobe celi type renal celi adenocarcinoma is 
juxtaposed to a high-grade sarcomatoid pattern. The chromophobe celi and the sarcomatoid areas occupies 
approximately 40% and 60% of the total tumor volume, respectively. Immunostaining is performed and the results will be 
reported in an addendum to confirm the chromophobe component. 
Addendum '. 
Special and immunostaining reveal that the chromophobe compone.nt of the tumor is posltiv7 for Ha.le's C~lIoid iron, EMA 
and focally for CAM 5.2. Our diagnosis is not changed by these findings. Therefore, the prevIously hsted final dIagnosis 
(see below) should be considered our final report. With this report, our st\.ldy of this case is now completed. Thank you

This tumor has an unusal morphology with areas closely resembling clear cell type carcinoma which are admixed with 
additional more high grade spindle cell components including those with tumor nuclei that are markedly enlarged, with 
macronuclei, Irregular nuclear shapes and pleomorphism. In addition, there are areas with glandular formation, 
remniscent of an ""intestinal"" type morphology. Taken together, these are unusual histological findings.

COMMENT: 
Part 3 is composed of a nodule of renal cell carcinoma with surrounding fibromuscular and adipose tissue. There are no 
lymphocytes and no suggestion of lymph node architecture. Lymph node involvement cannot therefore be confirmed 
histologically and this nodule is favored to represent either a soft tissue deposit or an intravascular nodule of tumor. The 
deposit In the adrenal gland is separate form the main tumor mass and Is therefore considered a metastatic' deposit. The 
pathologic stage is therefore rendered as pT3b Nx M1.

Comment: 
The aspirates are pauci-cellular and reveal rare small clusters of malignant epithelial cells in a background of blood. Only rare 
reactive bronchial cells and sparse inflammatory cells are present. The tumor cells are large with abundant granular cytoplasm and 
well defined cell borders. The nuclei are enlarged and mildly pleomorphic with moderately Irregular contours, coarse chromatin 
and prominent central nucleoli. The morphologic findings are consistent with a renal cell carcinoma. To confirm the diagnosis and 
help exclude a primary lung tumor, we performed a panel of immunohistochemical stains on the cell block material with the 
following resulls: 
Antibody 
CD10 
Pan-keratin 
CK7 
CK20 
RCC 
CD68

The immunohistochemical staining pattern supports the morphologic diagnosis. Positive staining for CD1 0 and pan keratin with 
negative staining for CK 20 is consistent with renal cell carcinoma. Although CK7 is often negative in most renal cell carcinomas, 
positive staining can be seen in up to 1/3 of cases. Similarly, negative staining for ReC is seen in approximately 13% of cases. 
Negative staining for CD68 indicated the tumor cells are not reactive pulmonary macrophages which can have similar morphology 
in rare cases. Negative staining for TTF-1 also rules against a diagnosis of a primary lung carcinoma. Overall, based on 
. the final diagnosis is that of metastatic renal cell carcinoma.

COMMENT : 
Parts 1 and 2: This renal tumor Is very large with gross invasion Into the perinephric adipose tissue. and with Ihe 
Gerota's fascia stretched over the tumor. A 0.15 cm defect Is prasentln a section conlaining apparent Gerola's faSCia in 
the upper pole region, with carcinoma present at Ihe corresponding Inked margin (slide 1 F). It is not certain whether or 
not the tumor has invaded through Garota's fascia Into surrounding 60ft tissue, or whether this represen ts ~ 
surgical defect in Gerow's fascia; therefore , the assigned pT stage is pT3a+. The case was discussed with 
who indicated that he noted a small defect in the this area of the specimen during intraoperative examination , an _ 
)thought there was a small amount of residual tumor In the corresponding adjacent tissue near Ihe adrenal gland. He 
then resected the adrenal gland and surrounding soft tissue. No tumor was recognized grossly In the adrenal specimen 
(part 2) during pathologic examination and se<:tlonlng; the remaining tissue in part 2 will be submitted for histology, wlth 
ttie result to follow In an addendumr It is mO$t likely that the final margin in the 60ft tiuue adjacent to the upper pole of 
the kidney Is benign. 
-The small tumor fragment in the main renal artery lumen (section 1A) was not Identified grossly, and is not attached 10 
the wan of the artery. However, the tumo~ cells are surrounded by fibrin. It is not certain whether this represents a tumor 
thromboembolus or an artifaclually displaced tumor fragment occurring during sectioning . The renal artery wall margin 
appears to be free of tumor. 
GROSS DESCRIPTION : 
The specimen is received in two parts.

conSists of a kidney surrounded by adipose tissue. On external examination the~ ~lCl<lIS slrete~ed and smooln. On

and the medulla, compresses the renal pelvis and extends into the perlnephnc <lnd hdar adlpo~e tissue. O.n se~al sectioning . most 
of the tumor is homogenous ly beige and soft. Yellow foci and areas of hemorrhage and nee.rosls are ~Iso Identified. The

MOLECULAR ANATOMIC PATHOLOGY FLUORESCENCE IN SITU HYBRIDIZATION ANALYSIS 
pomment: 
Molecular fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis demonstrates presence of trisomy of chromosomes 7 and 17 
in both the papillary as well as the clear cell areas of this morphologically complex renal cell carcinoma, In addition the 
papillary areas also show foci with tatrasomy of chromosome 17, ' 
This mOlecular phenotype is most consistent with a papillary renal cell carcinoma,

Interpretation guidelines: 
Chromosomal losses are considered significant if present in greater than 30% of cells. The loss is indeterminate if present in 20-
30% of cases, The loss is considered artifactual if seen In less than 20% of cases, 
Chromosomal gains are cons',dered significant if present in greater than 20% of cells, The gain is considered artifactual if seen in 
less than 20% of cases, 
Probes used: CEP1 (1p11,1q11,1), CEP7 (7p11,1q11,1), CEP17 (17p11,1q11,1). 
At least 25 cells are analyzed. The Signal distribution for targeted foci of renal carcinOma is recorded, If the test results are not 
consistent with the ciin',cal findings, andlor diagnostic, a consultation between pathologist and treating physician is warranted. 
This test was d8ve.o ad and its performance characteristics determined by the University of Pittsburgh, Department of Pathology,

COMMENT: 
Part 3; I am aware that this patient underwent recent left partial nephrectomy for a conventional (clear cell) renal cell 
carcinoma which was staged as pathologic stage pT1b Nx Mx. If the carcinoma in the right kidney (current resection) is 
an independent primary, then the pathologic stage of the right renal tumor is pT1b Nx Mx. The possibility that the right 
and left tumors represent primary and metastatic lesions cannot be entirely excluded, but this is less likely. If requested, 
mutational genotyping of the left and right tumors may be performed to compare the mutational profiles of these tumors, 
to more objectively determine whether they are more likely to be independent or related. 
Part 4; The specimen part number 4 labeled ""eleventh rib"" has been subjected to a gross examination only, If it is desired 
that this specimen be processed for additional stUdies, particularly microscopic examination, it is suggested that the 
case pathologist be notified within two weeks of the slgnout date of this report. This Is particularly important as 
specimens are routinely discarded .after a prescribed period of time.  A, Side: 1 1, Right

The tumor cells show prominent eosinophilia and focal areas of necrosis. The Fuhrman nuclear grade ranges bettiiesr+: 2
and 3 .Some of the Fuhrman grade 2 areas with fibrohistiocytic cores resemble type t papillary renal cell carcinoma, t ut
overall a diagnosis of type 2 papillary renal call carcinoma is favored.
lmmunohistochemical stains are performed with adequate controls and demonstrate that the tumor cells are strongly
positive for p504s and AE1 /3 and show focal I patchy positivity forCK7 ,CAa, and EMA. These findings support the
above diagnosis.

COMMENT:
Part 2 :The renal mass consists of an oncocytic epithelial neoplasm with prominent foamy macrophages and
hemosiderin laden macrophages associated with hemorrhage .The epithelial cells are arranged In solid, acinar, and
focally papillary .architectures .The neoplastic calls have large nuclei with prominent nucleoli and round nuclear
contours .A limited panel of Immunohistochemical stains is performed .The neoplastic cells are strongly immunoreactive
for P504S (alpha -methylacyl CoA racemase )and are negative for cytokeratin 7 and carbonic anhydrase IX. Parvalbumin
immunostain is equivocal ,with a high background .The overall pathology favors a type 2 papillary renal call carcinoma.
Parts I and 2: The renal cell carcinoma Is focally present at the capsular resection margin In an area where the capsule is
not intact (?capsular incision )and the parenchymal resection margin on the partial nephrectomy specimen. A
microscopic detached fragment of carcinoma is present in the fat overlying the tumor (part 1). it is uncertain whether any
microscopic residual carcinoma is present .Clinical /radiologic follow -up is recommended.

COMMENT:This tumor has an interesting morphology with a papillary architecture but in areas has elongated and angulated tubular
growth pattern reminiscent of mucinous and tubular spindle cell carcinoma .No distinct mucin is identified and there are
many foam cells In the background .Immunostains were performed and show that tumor cells are positive for CK7 and
racemase ,focally positive for CD10 and negative for CA(. While we favor this to represent a papillary renal cell carcinoma,
our differential diagnosis also includes an unusual variant of mucinous tubular spndle cell carcinoma.

Interpretation
MOLECULAR ANATOMIC PATHOLOGY FLUORESCENCE IN SITU HYBRIDIZATION ANALYSIS
Comment :Fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH) tests show monosomy of chromosome I and 2 In approximately 66%
and 54% of the tumor cells .Trisomy of chromosome 17 Is seen In 25% of tumor cells.
This FISH profile is suggestive of a mucinous tubular and spindle cell carcinoma .However a papillary renal cell
carcinoma cannot be ruled out.
Specimen type: Renal tumor.
Result:
1Signal 2 Signals 3 or more Signals
CEP1 40(65.6%) 21(34.4%) 0(0%)
CEP2 36(53.7%) 29(43.3%) 2(3.0%)
CEP7 13(21.3%) 44(72.1%) 4(6.6%)
CEP17 11(18.0%) 35(57.4%) 15(24.6%)
Abnormality detected:
Monosomy of chromosome I and 2 Is seen in approximately 66% and 54 %of the tumor calls. Trisomy of chromosome 17
is seen in 25% of tumor cells.
Interpretation guidelines:
Chromosomal losses are considered significant if present in greater than 30% of cells. Theloss is indeterminate if present in
20-30% of cases .The loss is considered artifactual if seen in less than 20% of cases.
Chromosomal gains are considered significant if present in greater than 20% of cells. The gain is considered artifactual if seen in
less than 20% of cases.
Results
Probes used .CEP1 (1p11.1g11.1), CEP2 (2p11.1g11.2), CEP7 (7p11.1g11.1), CEP17 (17p11.1g11.1).
At least 25 cells are analyzed .The signal distribution for targeted foci of renal carcinoma is recorded. If the test results are not
consistent with the clinical findings,and/or diagnostic, a consultation between pathologist and treating physician is warranted.
This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the Department of Pathology,
as required by the CLIA' 88 regulations.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION 
Histologic type: Mixed papillary renal cell carcinoma and clear 
cell renal cell carcinoma, approximately 50% of each tumor type. 
Histologic grade (Fuhrman Nuclear Grade) : Both tumor types are 
grade II 
Primary tumor (pT) : Tumor measures 5 em in greatest dimension with 
no extension beyond the kidney identified (pT1b) 
Margins of resection: Negative for tumor 
Regional lymph nodes (pN) : None identified, pNX 
Distant metastasis (pM) : Could not evaluate, pMX 
Adrenal gland: Negative for tumor 
Vascular invasion: Not identified 
/\ 
/ 
  
 
 
Non-neoplastic kidney: Chronic interstitial inflammation is present 
and some benign cysts are present 
and 
as Other findings: To delineate the two tumor types, CK7, EMA, RCC 
PAX2 immunohistochemical stains were evaluated on tissue block 3 
where the two tumor types are both present. The 
papillary renal cell carcinoma area is very 
strongly positive for cytokeratin 7 and there is a 
lack of cytokeratin 7 staining in the clear cell 
carcinoma area and this helps support the 
interpretation of the two tumor types being 
present. The EMA staining is stronger in the 
papillary area than in the clear cell area. The 
RCC staining is also somewhat stronger in the 
papillary area. The PAX2 staining is similar.

Gross Description
Received fresh and subsequently fixed in formalin labeled ""right
kidney"" is a 406 g kidney which is predominant covered with abundant
yellow lobular fat measuring 15 x 11 x 5.5 cm. (Weight and measurements
including fat). The specimen shows no discrete adrenal gland. There is
a 4.0 cm long ureter. The specimen is bivalved to show 2.5 x 2.0 x 2.0
cm orange irregular well-circumscribed mass located at the hilum. This
is within 1.2 cm of the stapled hilum. There is an additional pale
yellow irregular nodular lesion measuring 2.7 cm in greatest dimension.
This is well-circumscribed and does not appear to grossly invade
through the capsule. This is located near the periphery of the specimen, approximately 2.8 cm from the hilum and 2 cm from first
described tumor. The remainder of the parenchyma is pink red, smooth
and glistening with a discrete cortical medullary border. No other
discrete gross lesions are identified. No lymph nodes are grossly
identified in the surrounding fat. Representative sections of the
specimen are submitted as follows: 1 - vascular and ureteral margins, 2
- 5- representative tumor to radial margin and normal, 6 - possible
tumor to hilar margin, 7 - representative normal, 8 - 11 -
representative sections of additional tumor to radial margin (capsule)
and normal, 12 - representative section of normal between tumors.

Gross Description: 
Specimen A is additionally labeled ""left renal tumor #1, partial nephrectomy"" and is a 134.6 gram, 7.5 x 7.5 x 
6.5 em partial nephrectomy covered with a small amount of fat. The exposed parenchymal margin is marked with 
black ink and the capsule and perinephric soft tissue is marked with blue ink. The specimen is sectioned to 
demonstrate a well-circumscribed 5.2 em in diameter spherical yellow/brown solid nodule with focal softening and 
hemorrhage. The mass expands the renal capsule but does not appear to extend into the perinephric fat. The 
tumor is well-demarcated from the adjacent renal parenchyma which is remarkable for a 1 em in diameter thin­
walled clear fluid filled cyst (A4). The tumor comes within 0.3 em of the closest black inked parenchymal margin

Comment :
Immunohistochemical stains are performed on block A3 and
demonstrate the tumor
is diffusely positive for CD10 while being negative for CK7,
CD15, CD117, and
has faint positivity for racemase. While not entirely specific,
this
immunophenotype is consistent with renal cell carcinoma, clear
cell subtype.
Clinical History:
-year-old male with a left renal mass.
Gross Description:
Received is one appropriately labeled container, additionally
labeled ""left
renal mass."" It holds an 85 gram, 7.5 x 5.1 x 4.2 cm partial
nephrectomy. There
is a small amount of attached perinephric fat. The parenchymal
margin is inked
black, and the perinephric soft tissue margin is inked blue. The
specimen is
sectioned to reveal a 6.7 x 4.1 x 4.1 cm variegated friable
pink/tan mass
expanding the renal capsule and focally abutting the black inked
parenchymal
margin. The surrounding cortex appears compressed and slightly
distorted. The
renal capsule is expanded and there is a 0.6 cm area of pale
white nodularity
(A6), but appears grossly intact. The small amount of attached
perinephric fat
is intact. Tumor is given to Tissue Procurement. Representative sections are submitted of the lesion to include
its relationship
to the black inked parenchymal margin, blue inked capsular
margin, capsule and
adjacent parenchyma.

Addendum Comment
Special stains for microorganisms performed on block A2 (GMS and

negative. The original diagnoses are unchanged. The differential
diagnosis for
the numerous granulomata includes sarcoidosis.

Clinical History : 
with clinical diagnosis of left renal mass. 
Gross Description: 
Received are two appropriately labeled containers. 
Container A is additionally labeled ""hilar fat."" It holds a 
4.8 x 2.0 x 1.6 em somewhat disrupted fragment of 
red/yellow lobulated fibroadipos c tissue. The fragment is 
palpated and no lymph node candidates are readily 
identifjed. The fat is serially sectioned and entjrely 
submitted in blocks Al-A4,  
Container 8: 
Specimen fixation : formalin 
Type of specimen : hand assisted laparoscop ic nephrectomy 
Side of specimen : left 
Size and weight of specimen: 550 grams, 18 x 11 x 7.5 em 
nephrec lomy specimen (kidney and fat); the kidney is 
approximately 13.8 x 7.5 x 7.5 em 
Orientation: The specimen is received previously incised by 
the surgeon . The perinephric fat is markedly djsrupted. The 
entire length of the kidney is received opened exposing the 
tumor. Margin evaluation will be difficult given the 
disrupted nature of this specimen. 
The kidney capsule in the area of the previous incision is 
inked blue. 
Presence/absence of adrenal gland: Absent; the superior 
perinephric fat is disrupted along with the vast majority 
of the remainin g perjnephric fat 
 Tumor description/site: Tumor is a mid kjdney anterior 
cortical lesion with a solid, somewhat soft yellow 
diffusely brown and hemorrhagic cut surface. A portion of 
the tumor is missing as is adjacent normal kidney. These 
are presumed to be taken 
Tumor size: 8.4 x 7.3 x 6.0 em 
Presence/absence of multicentricity: absent 
Confinement/non-confinement Lo the kidney: The tumor ls 
abutting the overlying blue inked capsule. Given the 
perinephric fat is not disrupted, it js believed to be not 
attached. Exact determination of confjnement cannol be 
determined.

This staging information is based on information available at
the time of this report, and is subject to change pending
clinical review and additional information. Clinical History:
-year-old male with right renalmass.Per , the patient has ahistory of renal cell carcinoma.
Gross Description:
Received are three appropriately labeled containers.
Container A is additionally labeled ""kidney, right, anterior
renal mass, partial nephrectomy"" and consists of a 10.6 gram,
3.5 x 3.0 x 2.1 cm brown/tan fragment of kidney. The surgical
margin is inked black. The renal capsule is inked yellow. A
defect, 1.2 x 0.8 cm is identified and the external surface
around the defect is inked yellow. The specimen is serially
sectioned perpendicular to the blue and black inked tube margin.
Sectioning reveals a pale tan, at least 1.5 x 1.2 x 1.0 cm well-
circumscribed mass.The yellow inked defect goes right
through this mass.The mass abuts the yellow-inked margin,
black-inked margin and is less than 1 mm from the blue inked
margin. The adjacent renal parenchyma is yellow to brown/tan,
homogeneous.

Container B is additionally labeled ""kidney, right, posterior
medial renal mass,partial nephrectomy"" and consists of a 28.0
gram, 4.0 x 3.7 x 3.0 cm fragment of kidney, that was received
with a prior cut for tissue procurement. The capsule is inked
blue and the surgical margin is inked black. Sectioning reveals
a pale tan, friable, well-circumscribedmass,3.8 x 3.6 x 2.9
cm. Focal gray to red/tan areas consistent with necrosis and
hemorrhage respectively, are identified. Normal renal parenchyma
is not identified in the specimen. The mass is 0.1 cm from the
blue and black inked margins. Representative sections,
including closest approach to the margin are submitted in blocks
Bl-B2.
Representative sections from the grossly necrotic and
hemorrhagic area is submitted in block B3.
Container C is additionally labeled ""kidney, right, posterior

Gross Description:
Received is one appropriately labeled container, additionally
labeled ""left kidney."" It holds a 1,220 gram, 25 x 12.0 x 10.0
cm nephrectomy specimen. The perinephric fat is inked blue.
Within the fat there is a 16.2 x 8.0 x 8.0 cm kidney. Within the
lower pole there is an 8.0 x 7.2 x 7.0 cm tan/yellow/red
firm, well circumscribed, variegated mass. The mass bulges the
capsule, but does not grossly appear to invade through it. The
majority of the mass is solid (90%) with the remaining 10% being
cystic. The cysts are filled with dark brown liquid. There are
no white myxoid areas grossly noted. The mass does not invade
into the sinus fat or involve the pelvis. The remainder of the
kidney parenchyma is red/brown with a distinct corticomedullary
junction. The renal vein artery and ureter are all patent. The
adrenal gland is not grossly identified.

"," Site: Left kidney, left peri-aortic lymph node
Laterality: Left
Histology: Renal cell carcinoma, clear cell type
Stage: Not provided (requires additional information such as tumor size, invasion, and lymph node involvement)
Grade: Nuclear grade 3/4

Justification: The report provides a diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma, clear cell type, with a nuclear grade of 3/4 in the left kidney. However, information about the size of the tumor and its relationship with surrounding structures is not provided, making it difficult to determine the stage. The left peri-aortic lymph node excision showed no evidence of malignancy, but this does not exclude the possibility of nodal involvement by the renal cell carcinoma.

 SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT 
1) The specimen is received fresh, labeled ""Right Kidney, Portion of Adrenal Gland and Hilar Lymph Nodes"". It consists of 
a nephrectomy specimen with an overall dimension of 24.0 x 14.0 x 11.0 em. The vascular and ureteral margins are Identified and 
uninvolved by tumor. A portion of adrenal gland at the superior pole of the kidney, measuring 1.5 em in greatest dimension is 
identified and is unremarkable. The lower pole of I he kidney demonstrates a bulging mass. A Jongtitudinal section through the 
specimen demonstrates a large, orange-yellow, soft to firm mass arising from the lower pole of the kidney, measuring 11.5 em in 
greatest dimension. Areas of hemorrhage and focal necrosis are also Identified. The periureteral junction superior to the mass 
appears to be somewhat dilated. The tumor penetrates through the renal capsule and Is predominantly present in the perirenal 
fat. Sections through the tumor demonstrates that the tumor comes to less than 1 mm to the perirenal fat surgical margin. No 
definite lymph nodes are Identified in the hllar fat. Represenlative sections of the specimen, including some hilar fa!, are 
submitted.

1) The specimen is received fresh, labeled, ""Left kidney, adrenal gland, perinephric fat and renal vein thrombus"". It consists 
of a radical nephrectomy specimen composed of a kidney, adrenal gland and perinephric adipose tissue, weighing 330 grams and 
measuring 13.2 x 9.8 x 3.4 em. The external surface is inked black. The upper half of the kidney is replaced by an Ill-defined, 
vaguely, lobulated, variegated tumor mass, measuring 6.8 x 5.7 x 3.2 em, located 1.1 em from the adrenal gland. The tumor 
extends into the renal vein from which the tumor grows distally as an exophytic polypoid mass, measuring 3.6 em in length. The 
tumor also extends into the pelvis. However, grossly ureter margin and vascular margins are free of tumor. The tumor appears 
to extend to, but not through, the overlying renal capsule. On cut sections, the tumor is yellow-tan, friable tissue with multiple 
cystic degeneration and necrosis. The remaining kidney appears to be unremarkable. The adrenal gland measures 4.2 x 2.0 x 
0.7 em, and is unremarkable. No lymph nodes are identified in the perinephric adipose tissue, therefore, representative sections 
are submitted for histology. Photographs are taken. Small samples are given to TPS.

15.0 x 12.5 x 11.0 em well-circumscribed finn tan-white mass wilh central necrosis, hemorrhage and focal cystic degeneration. 
The mass occupies the majority of the kidney with a small portion of normal renal parenchyma identified at tha lowar pole of the 
kidney. The lesion grossly Involves the renal vein and its branches but Is grossly not present at the renal vein margin. The tumor 
pushes Into the renal sinus fat and directly abuts the overlying Inked resecllon margin. The tumor also shows direct extension Into 
the attached adrenal gland and portion of pancreas. The spleen Is grossly uninvolved by tumor and serially sections show no

"," Site: Left kidney, distal pancreas, spleen, left adrenal gland, para-aortic lymph nodes, left psoas muscle
Laterality: Left
Histology: Not completely specified in the description, but a large tumor is mentioned in the kidney, which might be a renal cell carcinoma. The involvement of adjacent organs and lymph nodes suggests a possible advanced stage.
Stage: Not provided (TNM staging would require additional information)
Grade: Not provided (This would typically require histologic examination)
Behavior: Malignant, as the tumor shows local invasion and lymph node involvement.

The description is not sufficient to provide complete answers for all categories, especially stage and grade, which usually require histopathological examination. The mention of a large mass with local invasion and lymph node involvement suggests a malignant process, most likely a renal cell carcinoma based on the location. However, without further information, staging and grading cannot be accurately determined.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1). The specimen is received fresh, previously Incised and placed in formalin, labeled ""Right kidney"" and consists of a total 
nephrectomy specimen with an attached ureter, renal vessels and perinephric fat, weighing 642 g post fixation. The external 
surface has been inked black. T~e kidney measures 12.5 x 8.3 x 4.6 em. The attached ureter measures 3.3 em in length and 
0.4 em In diameter in greatest dimension. The ureteral margin is identified and appears grossly uninvolved by tumor. On 
opening, the ureter is lined by a pink-ten soft faintly corrugated tissue. The attached renal vessels are identified, with a slight area 
of firmness Identified at the distal aspect of the smeller vessel, and the margins appear grossly uninvolved by tumor. The capsular 
surface is smooth and pink-tan. ihe kidney is bivalved to reveal a pseudo encapsulated yellow-red tumor mass measuring 8.1 x 
7.5 x 4.3 em, occupying the superi,or and mid poles of the kidney, which appears to be partially surrounded by a rim of dense white 
fibrous tissue. The mass appears to focally protrude Into the sinus fat with possible focal invasion, but does not grossly Involve 
the renal pelvis. AI the center of the mass, an Ill-defined firm white-tan focally hemorrhagic scarred area Is Identified measuring 
2.8 x 2.3 em in greatest dimension. Focal areas of necrosis are also identified. The mass abuts the renal calyces and serial 
sectioning reveals possible invasion by soft friable red-tan tumor tissue. The attached perinephric fat has been inked black and on 
cut section reveals a focal area of possible extracapsular exlension into the fat. The Inked margins do not appear to be grossly 
involved by tumor. Sectioning through the remainder of the kidney reveals a pink brown parenchyma, which appears grossly 
unremarkable. The corticomedullary junction is well delineated, with the cortex measuring 0.6 em in width. Sectioning through 
the perinephric fat reveals no grossly identifiable lymph nodes. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted to TPS for 
permanent section and photograp~s have been taken.

The patient is a 64-year-old woman with a history of left breast mass. A core biopsy was performed. The histology revealed an infiltrating ductal carcinoma. The tumor measured 2.5 cm in greatest dimension. No lymphovascular invasion was identified. All the surgical margins were negative. Immunohistochemical stains showed estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor positivity, with a Ki-67 index of 15%. The tumor was negative for HER2/neu by immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization. The final diagnosis is pT2N0Mx infiltrating ductal carcinoma, Grade II.

1. ""Site"": left breast - Justification: The report mentions a left breast mass and the final diagnosis is for the left breast.
2. ""Laterality"": left - Justification: The tumor is located in the left breast.
3. ""Histology"": infiltrating ductal carcinoma - Justification: The report states that the histology revealed an infiltrating ductal carcinoma.
4. ""Stage"": T2N0Mx - Justification: The tumor measured 2.5 cm, invading the muscularis propria (T2), but there was no evidence of lymph node involvement (N0) or distant metastasis (Mx).
5. ""Grade"": II - Justification: The report describes the grade as II (Intermediate grade or moderately differentiated).
6. ""Behavior"": malignant - Justification: The tumor is an infiltrating ductal carcinoma, which is a malignant cancer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I). The specimen is received fresp, labeled ""right kidney and part of adrenal"" and consists of a kidney with attached ureter, renal 
vessels and perinephric fat weighing 780 g in total. A portion of adrenal gland is also present on the specimen which measures 
1.6 x O.g cm. The kidney measures 10.3 x 6 x 5 cm. The attached ureter measures 6.5 cm in length and 0.3 cm in diameter. 
The attached renal vein measures 0.5 cm in length and 1.0 cm in diameter. The renal vessels and ureter margins are grossly 
unremarkable. The kidney Is inked black and bivalved to reveal a 4.6 x 2.7 x 2.5 cm well defined, orange-yellow tumor in the 
upper half of the kidney. Sectioning through the tumor reveats a soft, variegated cut surface. Grossly, the tumor appears to 
extend into the renal vein and abuts but docs not invade the renal petvis. Sections through the remainder of the kidney reveal a 
pink-brown parenchyma, with a well-defined cortico-medullary Junelion. The cortex measures 0.6 cm and the calyces appear 
normal. No _nOdes are identified in the perinephric fat. The specimen is photographed. Representative sections are

attached ureter, renal vessels and perinephric fat weighing 1205 g in total. The kidney measures 18.5 x 10.6 x 8.8 em. The 
attached ureter measures 8.1 em in length and 0.5 em in diameter. The attached portion of Inferior vena cava measures 0.6 cm in 
length and 3.9 cm in diameter with a protruding mass measuring 6.3 x 5.1 x 3.1 em attached to the wall ofinferior vena cava and 
completely obliterative the renal vein. The portion of renal artery measures 2.7 em long and 0.4 em in diameter. The renal artery 
and ureter margins are grossty unremarkable. An adrenal gland is Identified, measures 5.5 x 3.5 x 1.3 em and grossly appears 
unremarkable. The perinephric fat is of thickness ranging from 0.4 to 1.7 em. The kidney is Inked black and bivalved to reveal an 
Irregular soft mass with variegated appearance, measures 12.2 x 9.8 x 8.9 em, involving the entire upper pole and portion of the 
middle pole of the kidney. The mass appears to involve the perinephric fat, renal sinus and perihilar fat and grossly extends into 
the renal vessels. The pelviealiceal system at the upper pole is completely compressed, while at the middle and 10Vier poles, does 
not appear to be involved by the mass. Two 0.5 em In diameter renal calculi are noted present in the middle pole. The remainder 
of the middle and lower pole shows a muitiloculated cyst 2.4 cm in greatest dimension, which cannot be separated from the upper 
pole mass as no uninvolved renal parenchyma is grossly Identified. Sections through the remainder of the kidney reveal a pink

1 )The specimen is received fresh labeled ""left kidney and proximal ureter"" and consists of a kidney with attached ureter, fenal 
vessels and perinephric fat weighing 645 g in total. The kidney measures 15 .2 x 8 x 5.9 em. The attached ureter measures 2.5 
em In length and 0.5 em in diameter. The attached renal vein measures 3.1 em In length and 1.2 em In diameter. The renal 
vessels and ureter margins are grossly unremarkable. An adrenal gland is not identifed. The kidney is inked black and bivalved to 
reveal a well-circumscribed multi-lobulated yellow golden hemorrhagic mass measuring 7.6 x 6.0 x 5.5 em . The mass Is located 
at the upper pole of the left the kidney and it appears to be abutting and confined wilhln the renal capsule. The renal artery, vein 
and ureters are not Involved by the tumor. The mass invades the renal sinus fat, it is about 1.5 em from the renal hilar fat. Tumor 
grossly has 40% hemorrhage and 20 % necrosis. Sections through the remainder of the kidney reveal a pink brown parenchyma, 
with a well-defined cortico-medultary junction. The cortex measures 0.8cm and the calyces appear nonnal. No lymph nodes are 
Identified in the perinephric fat. Representative sections are submitted for TPS and for permanent sections. Photos are taken.

COMMENT: The tumors in this case exhibit a very unusual constellation of features that do not fit into any of our well defined 
categories . The main tumor mass is predominant ly papillary and solid with focal tubular areas. It is high grade. Focal areas of 
necrosis are evident. In the adjacent renal parenchyma there are innumerable neoplastic foci that have tubular features and 
basophilic cytoplasm. These measure from 3 millimeters to less than 0.1 millimeter . It is these foci of disease that are present at

the parenchyma l margin of resection. The main tumor mass is immunoreactive for CK7 and focally for racemase . 11 is negative for 
CAS. The satellite nodules are immunoreactive for CK7 but negative for racemase. BAF47 is not interpretable. The overall 
appearance is suggestive of a syndrome-associated tumor although the unusual morphology does not allow us to make this 
statement with confidence or to suggest the syndrome involved, if such is the case. Close examination of the contralateral kidney 
is advised. 
Seen in consultation with  
Some of/he immunohistochemistry and ISH les/$ were developed and their performance characteristics were determined by the Department of

NOTE, 
The non-neoplastic renal parenchyma ShO\,IS a significant degree of global 
glomerulosclerosis and moderat'e degree of vascular sclerosis. The preserved 
glomeruli are hypertrophic, an expected compensation for the obsolescen9~·.o~ ""~'''''''''''':;/ 
numerous nephrons. Glomerulosclerosis is frequently the final cons~guenQe_ 'of ., .. -.,.' 
adaptations that are brought about by hemodynamic changes and glomeru~""""""'''''''''''~'wr''''''''· 
hypertrophy following loss of functioning nephrons. Such loss of nephrons is 
often the result of an independent primary glomerular,' tubulo-interstitial, or 
vascular disease, the latter being the most likely precipitant in this patient 
given the significant vascular scarring observed. These patients usually show 
only focal visceral epithelial cell foot process effacement ultrastructurally, 
and they may be at risk for persistent sub-nephrotic proteinuria; typically 
this is not associated with hypoalbuminemia or edema. 
MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION, 
The section for light microscopy contains cortex and medulla, and was evaluated 
using HE, PAS, Jones silver methenamine, and trichrome (AFOG) stains. There 
are a total of 275 glomerulit thirty-six of vlhich are globally obsolescent 
(sclerosed). Rare glomeruli appear segmentally sclerosed, and a majority of 
the preserved glomeruli are hypertrophic. There is minimal mesangial expansion 
of preserved glomeruli without discernible capillary wall or basement membrane 
changes. Tubules contain occasional PAS-positive casts, and there is no 
significant interstitial inflammation apart from scattered microscopic 
subcapsular scars. Approximately 10% of the sample shows tubular atrophy with

RENAL PATHOLOGY EVALUATION OF NON-NEOPLASTIC RENAL PARENCHYMA IIIIIIIIIII 
DIFFUSE MESANGIAL EXPANSION WITH FOCAL NODULAR GLOMERULOSCLEROSIS 
CONSISTENT \'lITH EARLY DIABETIC NEPHROPATHY (SEE NOTE) . 
NOTE: FOCAL GLOBAL AND SEGMENTAL GLOMERULOSCLEROSIS, MOST LIKELY SECONDARY TO 
FUNCTIONAL AND STRUCTURAL ADAPTATIONS (SEE NOTE) . 
SEVERE ARTERIAL AND HYALINE ARTERIOLAR SCLEROSIS (SEE NOTE) . 
The non-neoplastic renal parenchyma shows changes·consistent with early 
diabetic glomerulosclerosis, as well as extensive global glomerulosclerosis and 
severe vascular scarring. Prominent vascular sclerosis has traditionally been 
considered part 'of the structural changes seen in .diabetic patients with kidney 
disease, although it is important to note that these lesions are non-specific, 
and they can result from a number of etiologiest including the 
microangiopathies from inherited or acquired procoagulant states, the healed 
phases of hemolytic-uremic syndrome or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, 
angiotoxic drugst radiation, and other metabolic diseases. Therefore, a 
primary form of vascular injury superimposed on renal damage from diabetes 
mellitus cannot be definitively ruled out. 
Segmental or global g~omerulosclerosis is frequen~ly, the, consequence of . 
adaptat~ons for hemodynamic changes and glomerular hypertr9phy following loss 
of' functioning' nephrons. 811Ch loss of:. nephrons is often the result of an 
independent primary :glomerular,. tubulai·{ interstitial, neoplastic, or vascular 
dis~ase. These patients often show subtotal visceral epithelial 'cell fqot 
process effacement ult,rastructurally, and they may be at risk for persistent 
sub-nephrotic proteinuriai 'they do not often manifest hypoalb~minemia or edema. 
In this patient,' diabetic SClerosis,' severe va'scular scarring, healed episodes 
of inte'rstitial 'nephritis from antineoplastic or pharmaceutical agents, and the 
resected'mass'all ,may have contributed to nephron loss with subsequent 
9lome~ular obsolescence ..

INTERPRETATION, 
Three different specimens from the same tumor were received. 
Specimen #1: only 1 metaphase cell was obtained, and contains a deletion of the 
short arm of chromosome 3, a characteristic finding in renal cell carcinoma, clear cell type. 
Specimen #2: No metaphases were obtained, and therefore the cytogenetic analysis could not be performed.

(20.1 x 10.8 x 10.4 em), to include left kidney (18.9 x 8.5 x 6.0 em), 
perinephric fat (maximally 4.5 em in thickness), and a small amount of 
disrupted-appearing adrenal tissue (2.4 x 1.4 cm). An 8.2 cm ureter (diameter 
0.3 em), 2.0 em renal artery (diameter 0.4 em), 1.3 cm renal vein (maximum 
diameter 1.8 em) are identified at the hilum. The specimen is inked black and 
bivalved to reveal a 7.8 x 6.4 x 5.9 cm circums·cribed tan/yellow, multifocally 
hemorrhagic mass with focal central necrosis « 10% of mass) in the lower pole. 
The mass abuts but does not grossly invade the renal vein and is 2.0 cm from 
the renal vein margin. Tumor expands and compresses the renal cortex, focally 
abutting the renal capsule, however, there is no clear gross invasion through 
the renal capsule into the surrounding adipose tissue. The closest black inked 
surgical margin is 0.8 cm. The remaining renal parenchyma is remarkable for a 
single 0.3 em tan/yellow nodule in a vessel in the mid/upper pole, remote from 
(> 3.0 em) the tumor mass. The remaining renal parenchyma is grossly 
unremarkable. An adrenal gland is questionably complete. The specimen was 
received focally disrupted (mid/superior pole); the 8.5 x 0.5 cm superficial 
defect in the adipose tissue has been inked blue per tissue bank resident. 
Representative tumor has been submitted to the tissue bank, four sections are 
submitted for quick-fixation, which correspond to four sections of tumor sent 
to the tissue bank (Tl-T4). In addition, representative tumor has been sent

NOTE, 
Only minimal non-neoplastic kidney parenchyma was available for examination due 
to the extensive replacement of nephrons by the neoplastic process. The sample 
of non~neoplastic kidney parenchyma examined showed diffuse parenchymal 
scarring and moderate vascular sclerosis, but only mild glomerulosclerosis. 
These changes are most likely the result of chronic ipsilateral collecting 
system obstruction, with a possible contribution by venous obstruction from the 
renal vein and inferior vena cava tumor thrombus. If the collecting system and 
vascular obstruction were only unilateral, only functional adaptive changes 
. (and not the extensive parenchymal scarring seen here) would be expected in the 
contralateral kidney. Changes of diabetic glomerulosclerosis are not apparent 
in this sample. A potential effect of this patient's remote organochlorine 
exposure is not apparent in the tissue but is also unknown. 
The kidney parenchyma has been reviewed by Dr.

NOTE, The changes seen in this biopsy are those seen in patients with moderately 
advanced diabetic nephropathy. An independent and superimposed immune 
complex-mediated glomerulopathy has been ruled out. Also seen are superimposed 
collapsing lesions in few of the glomeruli. To put these morphological lesions 
in better perspective it is important to correlate this finding with the degree 
of proteinuria and renal failure in this patient. Collapsing lesions are 
sometimes present in patients with advanced kidney disease due to other causesi 
we have observed this type of lesions in a small percentage of end-stage 
kidneys removed during renal transplantation; the cause and mechanism of this 
type of lesions is poorly understood at this time. However, a superimposed 
collapsing glomerulopathy in this patient cannot be ruled out with· certainty; 
patients with an active collapsing glomerulopathy can be expected to have a 
very pronounced proteinuria and renal functional impairment. It may therefore 
be prudent to determine the degree and the evolution of the proteinuria in this 
patient. 
prominent vascular sclerosis has traditionally been considered part of the 
structural changes seen in diabetic patients with renal disease. These 
vascular lesions are non-specific, however, and similar changes characterize 
various primary forms of vascular injury in the kidney. Such conditions include 
the healed phase of HUS/TTP and pro-coagulant states (thrombophilia, 
antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, etc.), autoimmune disorders (scleroderma, 
undifferentiated connective tissue disorders, etc.), toxic injury affecting 
components of the vascular wall (vero cytotoxin, antibody-mediated vascular 
injury, drugs with vascular toxicitYI etc.), physical factors (irradiation, 
status post bone marrow transplantation), and, potentially, metabolic diseases 
with an important vascular component (gout, diabetes I hyperhOmocysteinemia, 
etc.). Therefore, a primary form of vascular injury superimposed on diabetes 
mellitus should also be considered in the differential diagnosiS of this 
patient'S kidney disease. 
The widespread cast formation in the distal tubules is worrisome. Although 
these casts appear to be benign hyaline cast in that they are PAs-positive, 
they do not appear fractured, they are not surrounded by a cell reaction, and 
they are reactive for polyclonal IgA on immunofluorescence microscopy, a prior 
episode of light chain cast nephropathy cannot be ruled out with absolute 
certainty especially since the casts stain slightly stronger for lambda than 
for kappa light chains. In my experience, myeloma casts loose their specific 
light chain reactivity with time and become hyaline casts; they transform from 
pure protein cast, which are characteristically PAS-negative, to conventional

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: Renal 
The sample consists of renal cortex and outer medulla. There are two hundred 
and thirty four (234) glomeruli present in the sample submitted for light 
microscopy. Forty-four (44) glomeruli are globally obsolescent (sclerosed). 
The preserved glomeruli show enlargement of the glomerular tuft with diffuse 
sclerosis of the mesangium and increase of the mesangial cells. Several 
glomeruli show characteristic Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodules. Double contours are 
noted in some of the capillary loops with some glomeruli exhibiting signs of 
mesangiolysis. Focal reabsorption granules are also noted in two of the 
glomeruli with prominent epithelial cell proliferation and collapse of the 
capillary tufts. Tubules reveal marked thickening of the tubular basement 
membranes and focal tubular atrophy. PAS casts are seen. The interstitium is 
focally replaced by dense connective tissue, particularly in the areas of 
tubular atrophy. Approximately 25% of the sample shows tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis, as evidenced on the trichrome stains (AFOG). Arteries 
reveal severe intimal sclerosis and duplication of the internal elastic lamina. 
Arterioles show hyaline deposits in the vessel walls of both afferent and 
efferent arterioles. 
The integrity of the renal parenchyma and the structural details of the 
basement membranes were evaluated on sections stained \-lith PAS, trichrome 
(AFOG), and Jones' silver methenamine. 
IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE MICROSCOPY REPORT 1IIIIIIII 
Sections of frozen tissue were incubated wlth antibodi~s specific for the heavy 
chains of IgG, IgA, and IgM, kappa and lambda light chains, C3, Clq, albumin, 
and fibrin-related antigens. 
The sample consists of kidney cortex and medulla. There are fifty-one (51) 
glomeruli present, of which ten are globally sclerosed. There are no 
significant immune deposits present in the glomeruli. There is segmental, 
irregular granular deposition of IgM and C3 in the mesangial areas., Tubules 
contain reabsorbed proteins (albumin, IgG, C3) in the form of cytoplasmic 
granules. Tubular basement membranes reveal focal deposition of C3 (++/4+). 
Several casts in the distal tubules are reactive for polyclonal IgA with a 
noticeable overexpression of lambda over kappa light chains. Coarse IgM and C3 
deposits are present in the walls of several arterioles. There is no difference 
noted in the intensity of the staining for kappa and lambda light chains in the 
background of the tissue.

The immunofluorescence and electron microscopic evaluation of the tissue 
suggests an immune complex mediated glomerulonephritis. Electron microscopic 
evaluation shows that the majority of the deposits are subepithelial and 
intramembranous in location. This pattern of injury suggests a membranous 
nephropathy, currently probably not very active. A systemic autoimmune disease 
(SLE) or a remote post-infectious glomerulonephritis cannot be 'ruled out with 
absolute certainty. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 DESCRIPTION: 
Sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue (block All) were evaluated 
using HEt PAS, Jones silver methenamine, and AFOG (trichrome) stains; an 
HE-stained frozen section and semithin submitted for light microscopy. 
The sample consists of renal cortex and medulla. There are up to 173 glomeruli 
present in the sample. Thirty- two (32) glomeruli are globally obsolescent 
(sclerosed). The preserved glomeruli show a mild increase in mesangial matrix 
as seen on the PAS stain. The peripheral capillary walls reveal thick basement 
membranes, with fine tTspiken-like projections and many ""craters"". These changes 
are best visible on the Jones I silver methenamine stain. Tubules show normal 
cellular details. There are isolated, PAS-positive casts present in some 
distal tubules. Focal tubular atrophy is seen in areas of interstitial 
fibrosis. Significant interstitial inflammation is not evident in the sample 
examined. Approximately 10 % of the tissue included in this biopsy shows 
tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis, as evidenced on the trichrome stains 
(AFOG). Arteries show moderate sclerosis of the media, with focal replacement 
of smooth muscle cells by connective tissue. Arterioles reveal moderate 
subintimal hyaline accumulation toluidine blue-stained sections were also 
evaluated by light microscopy.

 fibrin-related antigens. 
The sample consists of kidney cortex and. medulla. There are four (4) 
glomeruli present, of which three (3) are globally qclerosed. There is diffuse 
granular deposition of IgM (trace), IgG (+/4+) and fibrinogen (+/4+) in the 
mesangial areas and along the peripheral capillary walls. There is also diffuse 
linear deposition of albumin (+/4+) along all basement membranes. Tubules 
contain reabsorbed proteins (albumin,' IgG, C3) in the form of cytoplasmic 
granules. Tubular basement membranes reveal focal deposition of C3 (trace). 
Few casts in distal tubules are reactive for polyclonal IgA. The interstitium 
reveals scattered fibrin deposits. There is no difference noted in the 
intensity of the staining for kappa and lambda light chains in the casts, in 
the deposits, or in the background of the tissue

The tissue examined at the ultrastructural level includes five (5) glomeruli. 
The glomerular capillary walls are greatly distorted by the presence of 
numerous subepithelial and intramembranous electron dense deposits and 
thickening of the basement membranes. Individual deposits are often surrounded 
by basement membrane material and IlspikeslI• The electron dense deposits are 
finely granular but they do not show organized substructures. There is 
extensive effacement of visceral epithelial cell foot processes present and 
widespread microvillous degeneration of the epithelial cell membrane. Several 
epithelial cells also show prominent vacuoles and increased numbers of 
lysosomes. Glomerular endothelial cells appear unremarkable and do not contain 
tubuloreticular structures. Subendothelial electron dense deposits are not 
seen. The mesangiurn shows normal cell elements and an extracellular matrix with 
few irregular electron dense deposits.  KARYOTYPE: Tl: 45,XY,-8[10] T2: 45,XY,-8[10]

specimen, measuring 23.5 x 11.5 x 7 em in total·. There is a kidney measuring 
10.5 x· 7.2 x 5 em, an adrenal gland measuring 3.5 x 2x 1.2 cm, a ureter 
measuring 8 em in length x 0.4 em in diameter, a renal artery measuring 0.8 em 
in length x 0.6 cm in diameter, and a bifurcating renal vein measuring 4.5 em 
in length, and ranging from 0.4-1.4 em in diameter. There are grossly two 
distinct masses in the renal parenchyma (T1 and T2). Mass Tl is a yellow/red, 
ill-defined hemorrhagic mass measuring 5 x 3.5 x 3 em in the lower pole. Tl 
extends beyond the kidney to within less than 0.2 em of Gerota's fascia (inked 
black). Tl also invades into the renal vein. The Tl tumor is found in both 
segments of the vein bifurcation, completely blocking one branch. There is 
also a large cortical cyst adjacent to mass Tl that measures 7 x 5.2 x 1 em. 
The eyst is lined by pink, smooth tissue with multiple small white nodules. 
The mass Tl is located 9 em from the ureter margin, 2 cm from the vein margin, 
4 em from the artery margin. Mass T2 has a pale tan necrotic and fibrotic 
component (4.9 x 4.5 x 3.5 cm) and a yellow component (6 x 4.2 x 2 cm). T2 is 
located in the upper pole and extends beyond the renal parenchyma. Mass T2 is 
1.5 em from the renal artery and vein margins, 8 em from the ureter margin, and 
4.2 cm from the Gerota's fascia. There is one simple renal cyst measuring 2 cm 
in diameter in the surface of the upper pole. No lymph nodes are grossly 
identified. Tissue from tumors T1 and T2 are taken for Tissue Bank and

RENAL PATHOLOGY EVALUATION OF KIDNEY PARENCHYMA: 
LEFT KIDNEY, NEPHRECTOMY: 
NOTE: DIFFUSE MESANGIAL AND FOCAL NODULAR GLOMERULOSCLEROSIS, MOST LIKELY 
REPRESENTING EARLY DIABETIC CHANGES WITH A SUPERIMPOSED PRIMARY 
VASCULAR INJURY (SEE NOTE) 
MODERATELY ADVANCED CHRONIC CHANGES OF THE KIDNEY PARENCHYMA, INCLUDING 
-FOCAL GLOBAL AND SEGMENTAL GLOMERULOSCLEROSIS, MODERATE (25% OF 
GLOMERULI AFFECTED), MOST LIKELY SECONDARY TO VASCULAR DISEASE 
TUBULAR ATROPHY AND INTERSTITIAL FIBROSIS, MODERATE (30-40% OF CORTEX) 
ARTERIAL AND ARTERIOLAR SCLEROSIS \'lITH HYALINOSIS, MODERATE TO 
SEVERE (SEE NOTE) 
The glomeruli show diffuse sclerosis of the mesangial areas with focal nodule 
formation. Nodular glomerulosclerosis is most often seen in the setting of 
diabetic glomerulosclerosis, although similar changes also characterize 
paraprotein deposition diseases, tmmune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis, or 
primary forms of vascular injury with endothelial damage and subsequent 
mesangial scarring. Paraprotein and immune complex deposition diseases can be 
ruled out since the immunofluorescence microscopy shows no immunoglobulin 
deposits. Because the history in this patient's electronic medical record does 
not include mention· of diabetes mellitus, additional studies were performed on 
the kidney tissue to further define the nature of the glomerular disease. 
Based on the results of the immunofluorescence examination, the process seen 
here is most likely mediated, at least in part,' by diabetes mellitus/metabolic 
syndrome(or related conditions characterized by hyperglycemia and products of 
glycosylation) potentially with a superimposed primary form of vascular injury. 
Repeated endothelial or vascular injury may be reflective of an underlying

some degree of parenchymal scarring may be due to local compression effects 
the ipsilateral masses, most of the chronic damage is likely secondary to 
vascular scarring. Therefore, a similar degree of chronic damage would be 
expected in the contralateral kidney. This patient, therefore, may be at 
for persistent or progressive proteinuria and renal insufficiency.

Pathologist. 
MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: Renal 
Sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue (block A12) were evaluated 
using HE, PAS, Jones silver methenamine, and AFOG (trichrome) stains; an 
HE-stained frozen section was also evaluated by light microscopy. 
The sample consists of cortex and medulla. There are 251 glomeruli present, of 
which 54 are globally sclerosed and 8 are segmentally sclerosed. The remaining 
glomeruli show expansion of the mesangial areas diffusely, with focal nodule 
formation. There are no discernible craters or spikes of the glomerular 
capillary wall basement membranes. Several double contours are identified. 
Approximately 30-40% of the cortical parenchyma shows tubular atrophy and 
interstitial fibrosis. Arteries and arterioles exhibit a moderate to severe 
degree of sclerosis \'lith hyalinosis.

and fibrin-related antigens. an'ti.bc'dies specific for the heavy 
and lambda light chains, C3, Clq, albumin, 
The sample consists of kidney cortex and medulla. There are 27 glomeruli 
present, of which 11 are globally sclerosed. There is minimal granular 
deposition of IgA (trace) in the mesangial areas. There is also segmental 
deposition of IgM and,C3 in the mesangial areas. There is diffuse linear 
deposition of albumin (++/4+) and IgG (+/4+) along all basement membranes. 
Tubules contain reabsorbed proteins in the form of diffuse reabsorption 
droplets. Tubular basement membranes reveal focal deposition of C3 (++/4+). 
Many casts in the distal tubules are-reactive for polyclonal IgA. Arterioles 
show focal C3 reactivity. There is no difference noted in the intensity of the 
staining for kappa and lambda light chains in the deposits, casts, or 
background of the tissue.

MEMBRANES, SUGGESTIVE OF AN INHERITED ABNORMALITY OF BASEMENT MEMBRANE 
COLLAGENS (SEE NOTE) 
SEE PRIOR ADDENDUM FOR ADDITIONAL FINDINGS 
NOTE, 
The corrected mean harmonic thickness of the glomerular capillary wall basement 
membrane was 251 nrn, which is below the lower normal limit of 264 nm  
  These authors estimated the range of normal values from the data of 
., as the mean (350 nrn) plus and minus two standard deviations 
(normal thickness values should fall between 264 and 436 nrn). Thin glornerul 
basement membranes are often a phenotypic expression of an inherited 
abnormality in basement membrane collagens, and often manifest as persistent 
microscopic hematuria in affected patients and family members. In women, 
basement membranes can be seen in carriers of the X-linked Alport syndrome 
gene, patients with autosomal recessive hereditary nephritis, and patients 
so-called benign hematuria or thin glomerular basement membrane disease. In 
males, this phenotype can also be seen in early stages of the Alport syndrome 
and, similar to the situation in women, in patients with so-called thin 
glomerular basement membrane disease and autosomal recessive hereditary 
nephritis. Thin basement membrane disease has been associated with 
heterozygous defects in the gene for alpha 4 collagen IV and familial benign 
hematuriai persistent hematuria is inherited as a dominant trait, progressive 
renal failure is inherited as recessive feature. The prevalence of this 
genetic defect in the general population has been reported to be highi the 
estimates lie in the 2-9% range. Homozygous defects in alpha 4 or alpha 3 
collagen IV have been reported to be associated with autosomal recessive forms 
of hereditary nephritisi patients with this type of defect have the strongest 
family history of hematuria, and in general! both parents and all offspring can 
be expected to have persistent microscopic hematuria. No features suggestive 
of the classic Alport syndrome (splitting! lamination! and thickening of the 
glomerular basement membranes) could be identified in this patient.

Part A, labeled 111. L kidneyll, consists of a 1449 gm left nephrectomy specimen 
(26.0 x 11.5 x 8.5 em) including kidney (18.5 x 8.0 x 7.0 em), ureter (8.2 em 
in length x 0.5 em in diameter), renal vein (O.S em in length,x 0.2 em in 
diameter), renal artery (2.6 cm in length x 0.6 em in diameter), and attached 
yellow/tan perinephric adipose tissue (up to 3.5 em in thickness). The 
specimen is bivalved. In the lower pole, 8.5 em from the ureteral margin, 4.9 
em from the renal artery margin, and 3.5 em from the renal vein margin, there 
is a well encapsulated yellow/red hemorrhagic centrally fibrotic mass (8.7 x 
7.4 x 5.7 em) compressing and distorting the renal parenchyma and the renal 
capsule. Upon sectioning, the mass is approximately 90% solid and 10% eysti'e. 
The mass comes to within 0.3 em of the blue inked deep/perinephric fat margin. 
The mass focally compresses and distorts but does not grossly appear to invade 
into the inferior pelvocaliceal system and renal sinus. 
The uninvolved kidney parenchyma is tan/brown with a moderately distinct 
cortical medullary junction and approximately six smooth walled tan simple 
cortical cyst (ranging from 0.7 to 3.5 cm in greatest dimension) scattered 
throughout the mid and superior poles. Each of the cysts is filled with clear 
serous fluid, with no excrescences grossly identified. The pelvQcaliceal 
system is moderately dilated and exhibits smooth glistening tan mucosa. The 
adrenal gland (6.2 x 2.5 x 1.2 em) is present and exhibits an unremarkable 
golden yellow cortex (0.2 cm in maximum thickness) and red/brown medulla (D.l 
em in maximum thickness) . -CZ-5451  examined. There is no evidence of active glomerulitis, proliferative lesions or'\

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: Renal 
Sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue (block A8) were evaluated 
using HE, PAS, Jones silver methenamine, and AFOG (trichrome) stains. 
The sample consists of cortex and medulla. There are 155 glomeruli present, of 
which 16 (10.3 %) are globally sclerosed. The remaining glomeruli show mild 
signs of hypertrophy of the tuft. There is very mild, focal expansion of the 
mesangial areas. 0n PAS and Jones silver stains there are no discernible 
crater-like defects or I1spikesll, and only isolated double contours of the 
glomerular capillary wall ba~ement membranes are recognized. Several distal 
tubule$ contain PAS-positive hyaline casts. Isolated distension of tubules is 
recognized in the cortical area. Approximately 5% of the cortical parenchyma 
shows tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis as seen in the trichrome stain

length x 0.7 em), and renal artery {2.0 em in length x 0.4 em in diameter}. The 
soft tissue resection margin is inked black and the kidney is bisected to 
reveal a multilobulated mass in the mid to lower pole (14.0 x 11.2 x 6.1 em). 
The mass is predominantly tan/yellow with mUltiple hemorrhagic foci. The tumor 
is less than 0.'1 em from the inked resection, 10.6 em from the ureteral margin, 
1.8 em from the r~nal vein margin, and 4 em from the renal artery margin. The 
tumor grossly appears to abut the perirenal adipose tissue. The tumor grossly 
extends to but does not involve the renal pelvis. The remainder of the renal 
parenchyma demonstrates well-demarcated cortical medullary junctions and is 
grossly unremarkable. A r.epresentative section of the tumor is submitted for 
electron microscopy, cytogenetic anaiysis, and tissue banking. A 
rep~esentative section of normal cortex is submitted for electron microscopy,

INTERPRETATION, 
Two different specimens of this specimen were karyotyped. 
Clonal aberrations that included loss of the short arm of chromosome 3 (-3) 
were demonstrated in each of 5 cells from one specimen, and were also seen in 1 
of 5 metaphase cells from the second specimen. 
Loss of chromosome 3 is a typical finding in renal cell carcinoma, clear cell 
type.

GROSS DESCRIPTION: 
The specimen, Part AI is received fresh, labeled with the patientls name I unit 
number, and 11#1. Right kidneylll consists of a 483-gram radical nephrectomy 
specimen (overall dimensions 17.0 x 7.2 x 5.0 em) consisting of kidney (10.2 x 
6.3 x 4.8 em) and attached yellow/tan lobulated perinep~ric adipose tissue (up 
to 3.5 em in thickness). Extending from the renal hilum is a segment of ureter 
(6.2 em length x 0.3 em in diameter), a segment of renal artery (1.6 em length 
x 0.4 em in diameter), and a segment of ~enal vein (O.S em length x 1.0 em in 
diameter) . 
In the mid pole, there is a well-circumscribed golden yellow focally 
hemorrhagic mass (2.4 x 2.4 x 1.0 em), which grossly appears to arise from the 
renal parenchyma and focally distorts but does not appear to invade into the 
renal sinus. Upon, sectioning, the mass is confined to the renal parenchyma, 
does not grossly appear to involve the renal capsule, and comes within 2.4 cm 
of the perinephric soft tissue resection ~argin. 
Within the renal vein, there is a loosely adherent friable hemorrhagic 
red/brown to yellow/brown necrotic tissue (probable tumor thrombus) contiguous 
with the aforementioned mass, which grossly appears to come within 0.2 em of 
the renal vein margin (previously sampled en face in the frozen section room). 
The aforementioned comes within 2.4 em of the renal artery margin and S .. 5 em of 
the ureteral margin. 
A 0.9 em inferior to the aforementioned mass, in the inferior pole of the 
kidney, there is a well-circumscribed yellow/tan friable nodule (1 satellite 
lesion, 0.8 x 0.6 x 0.6 em). 
The pelvic calyceal system exhibits smooth, glistening tan mucosa. The 
corticomedullary junction is distinct. No lymph nOdes are identified within 
the perinephric adipose tissue.

this time. There are no discernible craters or double contours of the 
glomerular basement membranes. Rare distal tubules contain PAS-positive 
hyaline casts. Less than 5% of the cortical parenchyma shows tubular atrophy 
and interstitial fibrosis. Arteries and arterioles exhibit a mild to focally 
moderate degree of sclerosis; some small arteries reveal significant narrowing 
of the lumen by accumulation of connective tissue in the subintima. Arterioles

0.7 em). The kidney is encapsulated by Gerota's fascia consisting of 
tan/yellow lobulated adipose tissue. Sectioning of the speeime'n shows a 
tan/pink to tan/yellow, interpolar, irregular mass (5.6 -x 5.0 x 5.0 em) that is 
partially encapsulated. The mass is 2.5 em to the arterial margin, 2.5 cm to 
the renal vein margin, and 10.5 em to the ureteral margin. The mass disrupts 
two-thirds of the renal parenchyma, and abuts the kidney capsule, coming to 
within less than 0.1 em of the inked margin. The tumor also grossly extends 
into the renal vein. The unremarkable urothelium is tan/gray smo~th and 
glistening and unremarkable. The remaining renal parenchyma is tan/brown and 
has a focally well defined corticomedullary junction. Sectioning of the 
perirenal adipose tissue (2.0 x 1.4 x, 1.0 em) shows a centrally hemorrhagic 
medulla, surrounded by a tan/yellow cortex. Further sectioning of the 
perirenal adipose tissue shows no lymph nodes.

Justification: The diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma is based on the gross and microscopic examination of the specimen, as well as the cytogenetic analysis. The tumor is located in the upper pole of the kidney and shows hemorrhagic and necrotic changes, with a predominantly tan/white and homogeneous appearance in some areas. The cytogenetic analysis reveals characteristic aberrations seen in renal cell carcinoma, clear cell type.

Sections of formalin-fixed , paraffin-embedded tissue (Block-B12) were evaluated 
using H&E, PAS, Jones' silver methenamine, and AFOG (trichrome) stains. 
The sample consists of cortex and medulla. There are 186 glomeruli present, of 
which 54 (29.0%) are globally sclerosed. The sclerosed glomeruli tend to 
aggregate in subcapsular areas of atrophy. The remaining glomeruli show and 
enlarged tuft bli't otherwise, no significant expansion of the mesangial areas. 
There are no discernible craters or double contours of the glomerular basement 
membranes on Jones' silver stain. Tubules reveal moderate invasion of the 
tubular epithelial cell layer by mononuclear inflammatory cells (tubuli tis). 
There are also several hyaline, PAS-positive casts and cellular debris within 
the capillary lumen. The interstitium shows focal edema and, in areas of 
atrophy, inflammatory infiltrate consisting mostly of mononuclear inflammatory 
cells and occasional eosinophils and neutrophils. Approximately 40% of the 
cortical parenchyma shows tubular atrophy and 'interstitial fibrosis. Arteries 
and arterioles exhibit a moderate to severe degree of sclerosis, with 
significant narrowing of the lumen.

GROSS DESCRIPTION: 
The specimen is received fresh, in three parts, each labeled with the patient's 
name and unit number. 
Part A, ""left kidney"", consists of a radical nephrectomy specimen (416 g) 
including a kidney (15.3 x 7.5 x 5.5 crn) with a bifurcated renal vein (1.8 em 
length x 0.5 and 1.0 em diameter), a renal artery (2.8 cm length x 0.5 crn

RENAL PATHOLOGY EVALUATION OF THE KIDNEY PARENCHYMA: 
LEFT KIDNEY (RADICAL NEPHRECTOMY) 
NOTE: GLOMERULOPATHY WITH A MEMBRANOUS PATTERN OF INJURY, WITH NUMEROUS

-FOCAL GLOBAL GLOMERULOSCLEROSIS (15% OF GLOMERULI) 
-FOCAL TUBULAR ATROPHY AND INTERSTITIAL FIBROSIS (20% OF THE PARENCHYMA) 
-ARTERIAL AND ARTERIOLAR SCLEROSIS, MODERATE 
The changes seen in the parenchyma suggest a membranous pattern of injury \I/'ith 
Page: 2 of3  an unusual immunoreactivity of these deposits. The deposits are localized and 
distributed along the glomerular capillary \I1al1 resembling a membranous 
glomerulopathy, however, the restricted immunoreactivity of the deposits is 
very. unusual and would suggest a paraprotein deposition disease of the 
IgG/kappa type. It would therefore be prudent to test for circulating 
paraproteins in this patient. The possibility of a membranous glomerulopathy 
with an unusual and restricted immunoreactivity of the deposits cannot be ruled 
out with certainty, however, the diagnosis of idiopathic or tumor-associated 
membranous glomerulopathy should only be considered in this patient if 
ci-rculating paraproteins and a plasma cell dyscrasia or other B cell 
lymphoproliferative disorders have been ruled out. 
MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: 
The sample consists of renal cortex and medulla not involved by the tumor. 
T4ere are more than 200 glomeruli present in the sample submitted for 
evaluation. About 15% of the glomeruli are globally obsolescent (sclerosed) . 
. The preserved glomeruli shot ... normal cellularity, without signs of inflanunation, 
fibrinoid necrosis, or sclerosis. The peripheral capillary walls reveal 
thickened basement membranes, with fine ""spikell-like projections and numerous 
diffusely distributed ""crater-like"" defects visible in the basement membranes 
in the Jones silver stain. Tubules ShO\,l normal cellular details. There are 
isolated, PAS-positive casts present in some distal tubules. Focal tubular 
atrophy is seen in areas of interstitial fibrosis. Significant interstitial 
inflanunation is not evident in the sample examined. Approximately 20% of the 
tissue included in this biopsy shows tubular atrophy, mild mononuclear cell 
inflammation, and interstitial fibrosis, as evidenced on the trichrome stains 
(AFOG). Arteries show moderate sclerosis of the media, with focal replacement 
of smooth muscle cells by connective tissue. Arterioles reveal subintimal 
hyaline accumulation. 
IMMUNOFL~ tnCROSCOPY REPORT: 
KIDNEY~ 
The sections were incubated with antibodies specific for the heavy chains of 
IgG, 19A, and 19M, for kappa light chains, lambda light chains, C3, Clq, 
albumin, and fibrin-related antigens. 
The sample consists of kidney cortex. There are 68 glomer'uli present. Eleven 
(11) glomeruli are globally sclerosed and one (1) glomerulus shows segmental 
sclerosis. There is diffuse granular deposition of 19G (3+/4+) along the 
peripheral glomerular capillary walls; these deposits are only reactive for 
kappa and not lambda light chains. There is dull reactivity for fibrin present 
along &11 glomerular capillary walls. Tubules contain reabsorbed proteins 
(albumin, IgG, C3) in the form of cytoplasmic granules. The interstitium 
reveals scattered fibrin deposits. Arterioles show focal C3 reactivity. There 
'is no difference noted in the intensity of the staining for kappa and lambda 
light chains in the casts in the backgroun~ of the tissue. 
ELECTRO~Y REPORT: 
KIDNEY _ 
Blocks: 6; Blocks examined: 4 tnick sections; 1 thin section. 
The tissue examined at the ultrastructural' level includes t\,lO glomeruli. The 
glomerular capillary walls are greatly distorted by the presence of numerous 
subepithelial electron dense deposits and thickening of the basement membranes. 
The deposits are sparsely distributed and they appear to have been incorporated 
into the outer aspect of the thickened basement membranes. The electron dense 
deposi ts are finely g.ranular but they do not show organized substructures. 
There is extensive effacement of visceral epithelial cell foot processes 
present and microvillous degeneration of the epithelial cell membrane. 
Glomerular endothelial cells appear unremarkable and do not contain 
tubuloreticular structures. Subendothelial electron dense deposits are not 
seen. The mesangium shows normal cell elements and an extracellular matrix 
\'lithout electron dense deposits.

The kidney sample examined shows minimal chronic changes, within the expected 
range for a fifty-one year-old man. There is minimal focal global 
glomerulosclerosis (2.2% of glomeruli) and minimal tubular atrophy and 
interstitial fibrosis (5% of the parenchyma. The sample also reveals changes 
that can probably be attributed to diabetes mellitus (early diffuse diabetic 
glomerulosclerosis); review of serum glucose level in the system shows several 
abnormally high values). Si9ns of active glomerular or interstitial 
inflammation, or glomerular proliferative lesions are not seen in the sample 
examined. There is also mode!rate vascular sclerosis with subintimal hyaline 
accumulation of the arteriola.r vessels.

elements. There are focal double contours in the glomeruli. Other basement 
membrane defects are not discernible. The interstitium show patchy areas of 
minimal inflammation by mononuclear cells. Approximately 5% of the cortical 
parenchyma shows tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis. There is an 
isolated microcyst in the cortex that shows connection with a proximal tubule. 
The cyst reveals a layer of taller epithelial cells. Arteries and arterioles

RENAL PATHOLOGY EVALUATION OF NON-NEOPLASTIC KIDNEY PARENCHYMA 
RIGHT KIDNEY, NEPHRECTOMY: 
KIDNEY WITH MINOR, NON-SPECIFIC ABNORMALITIES (SEE NOTE) 
NOTE: 
The sample of kidney parE,nchyma shows minimal chronic changes. The changes are 
non-specific and do not point to a specific disease entity. There is very mild 
glomerular hypertrophy, but the glomeruli are well preserved. Minimal tubular 
atrophy and interstitial fibrosis (less than 5% of the parenchyma) is noted, 
and arteries and arterioles also show minimal chronic damage. -
MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: 
Sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue (block A10) were evaluated 
by light microscopy using H&E, PAS, _ silver methenamine, and AFOG 
(trichrome) stains. 
The sample consists of kidney cortex and medulla. There are 206 glomeruli 
present, of which one (1) is globally sclerosed. The glomeruli show mild 
glomerular hypertrophy and minimal focal expansion of the mesangial areas. 
There are only isolated,l1ild irregularities of the glomerular capillary wall 
basement membranes. Rare distal tubules contain PAS-positive hyaline casts. 
Isolated tubular epithelial cells contain small quantities of protein 
reabsorption granules. Less than 5% of the cortical parenchyma shows tubular 
atrophy and interstitial fibrosis. Arteries and arterioles exhibit mild, focal 
sclerosis of the wall.  ----

RIGHT KIDNEY, NEPHRECTOMY: 
MINIMAL CHRONIC CHANGES OF THE KIDNEY PARENCHYMA (SEE NOTE) 
ARTERIAL AND ARTERIOLAR SCLEROSIS, MILD (SEE NOTE) 
NOTE: 
The kidney parenchyma shows minimal chronic changes, within the expected range 
for a sixty year-old man. There is isolated focal global glomerulosclerosis 
(0.77% of glomeruli) and Ininimal tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis 
(less than 5% of the parenchyma). The arteries and arterioles show a mild 
degree of vascular sclerosis. 
MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: 
Sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue (block A7) were evaluated 
using H&E, PAS, II1II silver methenamine, and AFOG (trichrome) stains. 
The sample consists of cortex and medulla. There are 129 glomeruli present, of 
which one (0.77%) is globally sclerosed. The glomeruli show no significant 
pathologic changes. There are only isolated irregularities of the glomerular 
capillary wall basement membranes. Rare distal tubules contain PAS-positive 
hyaline casts. Less than 5% of the cortical parenchyma shows tubular atrophy 
and interstitial fibrosis. Arteries and arterioles exhibit a mild degree of 
subintimal sclerosis.  KARYOTYPE: 46,XY, ins (2; 3) (q33; p13p23) [5)

protruding from the renal vein measuring 3 x 2 x 1 cm. The kidney is inked and bivalved to reveal a tumor
measuring 11.5 x 7.4 cm with friable, red/brown, variegated, cut surface. The tumor is replacing most of the
renal parenchyma. Fragments of tumor measuring 3.5 x 3.5 x 2.0 cm in aggregate were procured for

Sarcomatoid differentiation is absent. No renal hilar lymph nodes 
are identified. The adrenal gland is absent. The surgical margins 
are negative for tumor. The background kidney shows significant 
chronic changes with marked interstitial fibrosis and tubule atrophy 
consistent with chronic pyelonephritis. Multiple (4) stones are 
present within renal cysts (0.2 em to 0.4 em in greatest dimension). 
Case seen in consultation with . 
'Prostate, right, needle biopsies: Adenocarcinoma (Gleason 3 + 3)

ADDENDUM: 
The cancer cells in the prostate, right, needle biopsy (A2) are DNA 
diploid. 
Proliferation index (MIB-I) = 5.569%. 
This represents an intermediate value (low: 0.0% to <5.0%, 
intermediate: 5.0% to <10.0%, or high: >/= 10.0%). 
Intermediate and high MIB-I values are associated with an increased

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION 
The tumor within the right kidney is a clear cell renal cell carcinoma. The tumor grows as rounded nests 
and occasional solid sheets surrounded by an extensive vascular network. The tumor cells contain 
abundant amounts of clear to lightly eosinophilic cytoplasm. The nuclei are generally small, round, and  uniform with only minimal pleomorphism and no nucleoli. The tumor is confined to the kidney and does 
not penetrate the renal capsule. The non-neoplastic kidney is histologically unremarkable. The renal 
artery, renal vein, and ureter are each negative for tumor.

GROSS DESCRIPTION 
The specimen is received fresh kidney"" and consists of a 560 gm, 15.7 x 
11.6 x 5.S cm kidney encased in perirenal fat. The specimen is bivalved to reveal a 13.1 x 7.6 cm tan-red 
kidney with a 5.9 x 4.7 x 4.6 cm bright yellow, partially hemorrhagic and cystic, well-circumscribed mass 
occupying the upper pole. Representative sections of tumor and benign kidney are submitted for the 
TCGA genome project. The remainder of the kidney is placed into formalin and fixed overnight. The hilar 
structures are identified and opened and reveal no gross involvement by tumor. A shave margin of the 
ureter and hilar vessels are removed. A search for hilar lymph nodes does not show any recognizable 
lymph node structures. The perirenal fat overlying the tumor is inked black. Serial sectioning through the 
tumor demonstrates the tumor to be grossly confined to the renal cortex and within the renal capsule. No 
involvement or invasion through the renal capsule is identified. However, the tumor does extend to the 
renal capsule and abuts the capsule grossly. Sectioning shows no involvement of the tumor into the renal 
pelvis or renal vasculature. The tumor lies 0.3 cm from the nearest renal pelvis, 1.4 cm from the closest 
renal vein, and 0.6 cm from the nearest renal artery. The cut surface of the tumor demonstrates a bright 
yellow, partially cystic and hemorrhagic surface with focal areas of calcification. The remainder of the 
kidney uninvolved by tumor demonstrates an unremarkable tan-red cut surface with well-defined 
corticomedullary junctions, with an average cortical thickness of O.S cm.

This addendum is issued to reflect a discussion with the surgeon about the specimen. 
Initially, there was though to be renal cell .. ' at the renal it appeared to bulge out 
of the vein. However, in discussion with grossly and clinically the carcinoma appears to be 
well free of the surgical margin. Sometimes in fixation and manipulation of the specimen the vein can 
retract leading to the appearance of tumor at the margin. Given the discussion and initial findings in this 
this a to be the case here. Therefore, this is interpreted as no positivity at the vein margin.

MACROSCOPIC EXTENT OF TUMOR: Limited to kidney. 
HISTOLOGIC TYPE: Conventional clear cell renal cell carcinoma. The possibility of a chromophobe 
carcinoma was considered; therefore, a Hale's colloidal iron stain and immunostains were 
performed with appropriately reactive controls. The Hale's colloidal iron showed positivity in 
approximately 5% of the tumor cells. The tumor cells were negative for E-cadherin, CD117, and 
CK7. There is positivity with vimentin and CD10. The immunohistochemical profile and relative 
lack of significant positivity with Hale's colloidal iron is consistent with a conventional renal cell 
carcinoma. 
HISTOLOGIC GRADE: Grade 3. Nuclei are irregular, approximately 20 microns; nucleoli are large and 
prominent. Most of the tumor shows grade 2 nuclei; however, in several areas, entire fields show 
Fuhrman grade 3 nuclei.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION 
The frozen section diagnosis is confirmed. The primary renal neoplasm is a type 2 papillary renal cell 
carcinoma, Fuhrman nuclear grade 3. The tumor is confined to the kidney with a predominately pseudo 
solid appearance due to compression of papillae and tubules. Aggregates offoamy macrophages and 
focal areas of papillae with fibrovascular cores and scattered psammoma bodies are present. The tumor 
has a somewhat biphasic appearance with an admixture of cells with round, more uniform nuclei and 
scant cytoplasm and cells with enlarged, irregular nuclei with focally prominent nucleoli and moderate 
amounts of eosinophilic cytoplasm. The tumor is 0.55 cm from the kidney margin and does not penetrate 
the renal capsule. Mild arteriosclerosis is seen in the adjacent uninvolved kidney.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION Renal carcinoma, classification 
Permanent sections show a variant of papillary renal cell carcinoma with areas of solid proliferation 
without papillary structures. The lesion has a pseudocapsule, and it appears to be resected with 
approximately 0.4 mm distance between the tumor and the normal kidney resection plane. The papillary 
appearance is more pronounced at the periphery of the tumor. Nuclei are bland and are consistent with 
Fuhrman grade 1 without evidence of nucleoli. The celis in the solid areas have some kind of an 
eosi Hic matrix with occasional globoid bodies. Mitotic figures are rare, and in some areas, there is 
 the appearance pseu 
good psammoma bodies represented. 
lymphatic invasion is not observed. 
IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL STUDIES: 
These are carried out to evaluate the solid areas of the tumor. The controls are appropriate, and the 
following results are obtained: 
Synaptophysin -negative. 
Chromogranin -negative. 
Keratin cocktail- there is 1-2+ reactivity. 
CK7 -there is 1 + stain ing of the cytoplasm. 
Vimentin -there is good vimentin staining, about 2-3+. 
CD10 -negative. 
COMMENT: 
We are dealing with an unusual variant of papillary renal cell carcinoma with solid areas and presence of 
low-grade nuclei indicating that this would fit a type 1 papillary carcinoma which is associated with a 
better survival rate than classic clear renal cell carcinomas. The lesion appears to be resected although it 
is close to the resection plane, at least focally.~s reviewed the slide and concurs. A

Gross Description: ""Left kidney."" A 257 gram, 13.5 x 7.5 x 3.0 cm kidney with a small amount of
perinephric fat. The renal artery and vein at the margin are grossly unremarkable. The 5.5 cm long
ureter is unremarkable at the margin. 4.5 cm from the margin of resection the lumen is partially
obstructed by a bulging 1.5 x 1.0 cm tumor nodule extending from a 5.5 x 4.5 x 3.0 cm lobulated fleshy
gray mass located in the lower pole. This mass is grossly confined within the renal capsule but invades
the renal collecting system. No extension into the scant amount of perinephric fat is identified. There is
a well delineation of pale kidney tissue surrounded by viable kidney tissue in the upper pole adjacent to
the mass. There are two additional simple cysts, one in the upper pole, one in the lower pole up to 0.9
cm. The surrounding kidney tissue is unremarkable. No enlarged lymph nodes are identified.

Pathologic stage: pT3 NX MX
Non-neoplastic kidney: Multiple cysts with focal calcification. Patchy scarring and chronic pyelonephritis,
likely related to tumor effect.
Diagnosis Details:
Comments: Tumor morphology is unusual and does not fit typical classification schemes. Some areas
have papillary growth, others are more solid and infiltrative with irregular, infiltrative borders into the
renal parenchyma. Numerous areas are solid with large epithelial cells with granular cytoplasm. Tumor
invades the collecting system which has been associated with more aggressive neoplasm.
Some features raise the possibilty of a translocation-associated carcinoma or possibly a hereditary
syndrome-type carcinoma.
Immunostains for cytokeratin 1, P504, pancytokeratin, CD10, p63, and PAX-8 were performed. The
tumor cells are positive for PAX-8 and P504. Pancytokeratin stains portions of the tumor strongly (the papillary areas )but is negative in other areas .CK7 and CD10 are negative .p63 is negative. This
immunostaining pattern is not specific and does not clarify the differential diagnosis further ,other than
to confirm that is is a renal cell carcinoma.
ADDENDUM REPORT
The consultant opinion is that this tumor is best classified as a papillary renal cell carcinoma (type 2),
with foci of sarcomatoid and rhaboid change .However ,a renal cell carcinoma related to hereditary
leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer syndrome (HLRCC )cannot be excluded .To exclude this, clinical
evaluation for cutaneous leiomyomas and genetic testing (can be performed on peripheral blood) for
mutations of the fumarate hydratas gene are suggested.

Non-neoplastic kidney: Atherosclerosis, mild glomerulosclerosis and scarring.
Focal papillary adenoma (1 mm) away from tumor mass, Immunostains were previously performed on
the biopsy and consistent with a papillary RCC. Neoplasm has relatively higher Fuhrman nuclear grade
than typical papillary renal cell carcinoma (probably grade 3), however morphology is compatible.
Immunostains for cytokeratin 7, pancytokeratin, p504S and PAX-8 were performed and all four stains
are positive. This is consistent with a papillary-type renal cell carcinoma.

some of those nodules represent metastatic tumors in the angiolymphatic spaces. The metastatic tumor in the hilar lymph nodes shows perineural invasion.  
A panel of immunohistochemical stains was performed to rule out possible collecting duct carcinoma. 
The tumor is positive for CK20, RCC, EMA, and Cam5.2. It is negative for ULEX Europaeus agglutinin, 
HMW -CK, Vimentin, CK7 and CEA. There is weak stain of CK19, probably due to non-specific stain.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:  
A. LEFT RADICAL NEPHRECTOMY AND RETROPERITONEAL LYMPH NODES  
Received fresh in a container labeled with patient name and “left radical nephrectomy and 
retroperitoneal lymph nodes” is a kidney and perinephric adipose measuring 15 x 7.5 x 7.0 cm together.  
The kidney alone measures 12 x 6 x 5 cm and has a 6 cm long, 0.6 cm diameter proximal ureter.  At the renal hilum is a 15 x 5 x 4 cm portion of fibroadipose, nodular lymph nodes and probable tumor.   Sectioning of the renal parenchyma reveals an inferior pole 6.5 x 5.5 x 6.1 cm firm, tan mass with 
irregular edges.  Surrounding the main tumor mass the renal parenchyma contains multiple, small 
nodules of tumor that appear to be separate from the primary mass.  Portions of the tumor cut surface show necrosis and hemorrhage.  The tumor invades hilar adipose and encases the renal artery and vein at the hilum.  There is no tumor present in the lumen of vascular margins.  Tumor also encases 
proximal ureter, but the ureter is probe patent.  Tumor obliterates the renal pelvis.  The 3.0 x 2.5 x 1.0 
cm adrenal gland is hemo rrhagic but uninvolved by tumor.  Tumor appears to penetrate renal capsule 
only towards the renal hilum.  There does not appear to be penetration of Gerota's fascia.   Remaining renal parenchyma has a reasonably well defined cortico- medullary junction.  Se ctioning of the hilar soft 
tissue reveals that it is largely replaced by an 11 x 4.5 x 3.5 cm lobulate mass of tumor that is contiguous with the tumor in the kidney.  Additionally, at the periphery of this main mass are multiple <0.5 cm separate, tan, well  circumscribed nodules of tumor probably representing lymph nodes with 
metastatic disease.

Comment(s):  
Representative sections of the main lesion and the incidental adenoma were reviewed by Dr. who 
concurs with this assessment.  Both carcinoma and adenoma share a similar immunophenotype-CK 7 
positive, EMA positive, CD 56 negative supporting the above diagnosis.  
 As per the surg eon (Dr.), the lesion was entirely removed with intraoperative  visualization of the intact 
tumor capsule. However, the specimen received in the pathology department exhibited a disrupted capsule at the parenchymal resection side, possibly an ex vivo artif act.  Clinical -operative correlation is 
essential.  Close follow -up is indicated.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:  
A. KIDNEY LEFT  
Received fresh is a 1,098 gram  nephrectomy specimen with attached perinephric fat measuring 23 x 14 
x 9 cm.  The cortical surface has a nodular appearance.  The kidney proper is 18 x 12 x 8 cm.  The 
parenchyma has been replaced by a papillary tan- brown mass measuring 17 x 11.8 x 8 cm.  It has 
obliterated the renal pelvis and calyces.  Areas of hemorrhage and necrosis are noted.  There are clear fluid filled cysts throughout.  There is a rim of normal appearing renal tissue measuring 4.5 x 3.5 x 2.1 
cm.  On sectioning through the mass it  extends into the perinephric fat. In the hilar region there is a 
nodule that measures 6.3 x 4.7 x 2.7 cm.  On sectioning, it appears to be an extension of a tubular 
structure.  No adrenal gland is identified and within the perinephric fat lymph nodes are found ranging in size from 0.1 to 0.3 cm.  Representative sections were taken for tissue procurement and a gross 
photograph was taken.  Representative sections are submitted in A1 (vascular and ureteral margins), 
A2-A12 (tumor), A13 (renal parenchyma), and A14-A17 (multiple possible lymph nodes).

C. LEFT KIDNEY  
Received fresh, labeled as ""left kidney"" is an intact kidney with attached perinephric fat measuring 15 x 
6 x 4 cm and weighs 301 g. Extending from the renal pelvis are a ureter (7.5-cm in length and 0.3 cm in 
diameter). Tumor does not extend into the ureter, artery or vein and is not present at the resection 
margin. There is a 2.5 x 1.8 x 1.5 cm well circumscribed, solid, white-tan mass with focal necrosis in the cortex. It is 1.0 cm from the renal hilum. The mass is protruding out of the cortex but grossly appears to be confined by thin renal capsule and does not invade perinephric fat, Gerota’s fascia, calyces, or 
pelvis. There are two additional masses (1.0 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm and 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm) present in the cortex 
(same side with the largest mass) located 0.1 cm to each other but at distance from the dominant mass.  Both masses are well circumscribed and solid without necrosis. They are 0.4 cm from the renal hilum. Both two masses are confined by renal capsule. Two additional small white nodules (0.1 and 0.3- cm in 
diameter) are present in the renal surface at the same side with the three larger masses. All masses 
and white nodules are covered by perinephric fat which is inked blue.  Another solid nodule (0.4-cm in 
greatest dimension) is present in the cortex on the opposite side with the masses and is 0.4 cm to the closest renal capsule. The uninvolved renal parenchyma is tan-brown with a well -defined cortico-
medullary junction and orderly cortical striations  and medullary rays. The pelvis and calyces appear 
smooth. There is no adrenal gland present in the specimen. No lymph nodes or stones are identified. Gross photographs are taken. Representative sections are submitted as follows:

Analytical Interpretation of Results:  ASPSCR1/TFE3 translocation negative 
Clinical Interpretation of Results:  
Translocation involving ASPSCR1 (also known as ASPL) at 17q25 to the transcription factor  
TFE3 at Xp11.1 was evaluated with interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on  formalin -fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using a proprietary probe set labeled in the

signals of the ASPSCR1 locus and theTFE3 locus were not identified in this specimen. These  
results do not exclude a TFE3 translocation in this tumor as such tumors in the kidney can  
have multiple fusion partners.

been cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration.  The  
FDA has determined that such clearance or approval  is not necessary.  
 Overview of this test  
 The ASPSCR1 -TFE3 Dual Color, Dual Fusion Translocation Probe is designed to detect the  
 juxtaposition of ASPSCR1 (also known as ASPL) to the transcription factor TFE3. Translocation of  
 ASPSCR1 (also known as AS PL) to the transcription factor TFE3, der(17)t(X;17)(p11.2;q25), is  
 characteristic of alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS) and present in the majority of cases. The  
 ASPSCR1 PDGFB  Dual Color, Dual Fusion Translocation Probe is a mixture of the ASPSCR1 
probe 
  (BAC clones RP11 -756O14, RP11-455O6 and RP11-428B22 centromeric of ASPSCR1) labeled  
 with SpectrumGreen and the TFE3 probe labeled with SpectrumOrange (BAC clones RP11 -552E4,  
 RP11 -344N17 and RP11- 753G22 telomeric of TFE3). The expected pattern in a normal nucleus  
 hybridized with the ASPSCR1- TFE3 probe is the two orange, two green signal pattern. In a nucleus  
 harboring  the der(17)t(X;17)(p11.2;q25), the most common pattern is one orange signal, one green  
  signal, and one orange/green (yellow) fusion signals resulting from the reciprocal translocation.  
  
 This probe was labeled in the according to the method of

Note).  
 The examination of this case material and the preparation of this report were performed by the staff pathologist.  
 Note : 
Sections of the perirenal fat and psoas muscle nodules show papillary  
adenocarcinoma, consistent with type 1 papillary renal cell carcinoma.   We 
interpret these nodules as recurrent tumor from the patient' s original renal  
cell carcinoma that arose from reported seeding during the prior laparoscopic  
partial nephrectomy (pathology material from that procedure is not available for  
review). The tumor adjacent to the kidney is associated with old scarring and  
fibrosis likely related to the prior surgical procedure. There is no tumor in the renal parenchymal scar. There is focal invasion of the psoas muscle by the  
 tumor and so the local pathologic stage is considered rpT4. A small lymph node  
with metastatic papillary adenocarcinoma is seen adjacent to the psoas  mass.  
Histologic sections of the unattached mass show a lymph node with metastatic  
papillary adenocarcinoma.   Both nodes show extracapsular extension of the tumor.  
 
The dimensions of the tumor nodules in the perirenal fat are:  
      
     Posterior -superior -medial           2.5 x 2.0 x 1.3 cm.  
Psoas                     3.5 x 3.0 x 2.0 cm.  
Posterior -inferior -lateral           1.1 cm in greatest dimension.  
Posterior -interpolar -lateral           1.4 cm in greatest dimension.  
 Gross Description:  
The specimen is rec eived in a container of formalin, labeled with the patient's  
name and ""right radical nephrectomy."" It consists of a kidney and surrounding  
perinephric fat, measuring 16 x 10 x 6.5 cm.   An additional portion of adipose  
tissue accompanies the kidney, measuri ng 10.5 x 8.0 x 1.5 cm.   Prior to receipt  
in the histology suite, the external surface of the kidney was inked with black  
ink.  The posterior aspect of the kidney was previously sectioned in a coronal  
plane. A portion of a mass in the posterior -medial -superior perinephric fat was  
banked for future research.   A portion of ureter measuring 10 cm in length by  
0.3 cm in diameter is attached to the kidney.   The ureter is probe patent.  
Short segments of the renal artery and vein protrude from the specimen.   The 
renal vein is patent and free of thrombus.   The renal artery is patent and free  
of thrombus.   A globular, firm, tan, homogeneous mass traversed by fibrous  
septae is present in the perinephric fat, posterior -medial -superior to the  
kidney, measuring 2.5 x 2. 0 x 1.3 cm.   A portion of this mass was previously  
harvested for research. The surface of the mass abuts the resection margin, but  
does not appear to penetrate the resection margin.   The mass compresses, but  
does not appear to invade the renal cortex.   A portion of psoas muscle is  
present on the posterior/inferior aspect of the specimen, measuring 4.0 x 2.5 x  
0.6 cm.   The psoas overlies a globular, firm, tan homogeneous mass traversed by  
fibrous septae, measuring 3.5 x 3.0 x 2.0 cm.   The mass appears to inv ade the  
psoas muscle though it does not penetrate to the resection margin.   A third firm  
tan mass is found in the inferior -posterior -lateral pararenal fat, measuring 1.1  
cm in greatest dimension.   It abuts the surgical resection margin.   A fourth  
firm tan mass is found in the posterior -lateral -interpolar pararenal fat,  
measuring 1.4 cm in greatest dimension.   It abuts, but does not penetrate the  
renal capsule. It abuts the surgical resection margin.   Sections of the kidney  
show a scar in the interpolar regi on, measuring 2.5 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm. A few  
surgical clips are embedded in the scar.    A thin walled cyst is present in the  
inferior pole of the kidney, measuring 0.5 cm in diameter.   The unattached fat  
is sectioned.   No lesions are seen.   No adrenal gland is present.   A firm tan  
nodule with a smooth surface that is unattached to any of the other tissue  
fragments is present, measuring 1.2 x 1.1 x 0.7 cm.   The hilar fat is soaked in  
Carnoy' s fixative and then dissected for lymph nodes.    
The following sections are submitted:  
     1     renal artery, renal vein and ureter margins;  
     2     additional ureter;

Note:  
The tumor is composed of a variable morphology including areas of typical  
papillary renal cell carcinoma, and areas resembling collecting duct, carcinoma,  
medullary carcinoma, and sarcomatoid areas. 
However, TFE3 were negative. The  
majority of the H/E slides demonstrate a papillary architecture but there are  
many areas that are difficult to classify. Numerous immunohistochemical stains  
 and additional sections help support the above diagnosis but the tumor may  
better be represented as unclassified type. The translocation carcinoma is  
virtually ruled out with the negative HMB45 and Melan- A. The tumor is variable  
positive for cytokeratin 34betaE12 and CK7 in the more papillary areas with  
diffuse positivity with cytokeratin AE1/AE3. There is also a nonspecific  
perinuclear dote like staining with the p63. There does not appear to be any  
mucin.   The overall staining with posit ive CK7, PAX -2, AMACR, and focal CD10  
support a papillary renal cell carcinoma but does not totally rule out a  
collecting duct carcinoma/medullary carcinoma. The patient does not have a  
history of sickle cell trait and the morphology is not convincing of m edullary  
carcinoma. The possibility of an invasive urothelial carcinoma is unlikely  
because extensive sampling failed to demonstrate malignant TCC or CIS component.  
A TTF -1 immunostain was also negative. The above stains were performed with  
adequate contro ls. 
 
Gross Description:  
The specimen is received in formalin three parts labeled with the patient's  
name. 
Part A labeled""interaortocaval lymph nodes"" and consists of a portion of  
irregular, ragged, gray -yellow, lobulated fat, which has dimensions of 3.0 x 2.6 
x 0.8 cm. An exhaustive search of the fat to include the use of palpation and  
chemical clearing agent reveals four probable lymph nodes that range from 0.4 to  
1.4 cm in greatest dimension.    
 
The lymph nodes are entirely submitted as labeled:  
     A1      one bisected lymph node;  
     A2      three lymph nodes submitted in toto.  
 Part B labeled ""right paracaval lymph nodes"" consists of a portion of irregular,  
ragged, gray -yellow lobulated fat, which has dimensions of 8.0 x 4.0 x 1.5 cm.  
An exhaustive search of the fat to include the use of palpation and a chemical  
clearing agent reveals eleven probable lymph nodes that range from 0.4 to 2.4 cm in greatest dimension.    
 The lymph nodes are entirely submitted as labeled:  
     B1 -2     ten lymph nodes submitted in toto;  
     B3 -4     one bisected lymph node.  
 Part C labeled ""right kidney.""  
Specimen components and dimensions:   The specimen consists of a right kidney  
received with a moderate amount of attached perinephric fat. The specimen has  
dimensions of 15.6 x 7.4 x 6.6 cm. The renal parenchyma has dimensions of 10.4 x  
6.2 x 5.4 cm. An adrenal gland is not present. There is an attached segment of  
ureter, which has a length of 7.9 cm and a diameter of approximately 0.5 cm  
throughout. The vessels are identified and ligated close to the kidney. Some tissue has been submitted fresh to the   
Size, appearance, and location of tumor:   The central kidney is remarkable for a  
gray-white, indurated, fibrous mass with lobulated edges, which has dimensions  
 of 6.5 x 6.2 x 5.0 cm.  
Renal capsule/renal sinus:   At the hilum, this mass extends to the capsule. It  
is possible there are some foci where the mass traverses   the capsule and  
superficially invades the hilar fat. The renal sinus fat is grossly invaded.  The 
mass extends through the capsule, into the perinephric fat and to within 1 mm of  
the posterior inked soft tissue edge.  
Renal vein:   The renal vein is grossly invaded and extends to within 0.3 cm of  
the renal vein margin.  
Lymph nodes (size, number, &  location):   An exhaustive search of the hilar fat  
to include the use of palpation and a chemical clearing agent reveals no grossly  
identifiable lymph nodes.  
Other findings:   The renal parenchyma is red- brown with a well defined  
corticomedullary border and a cortical thickness of approximately 0.6 cm  
throughout. The urothelium is gray -white, smooth and glistening with some of the 
pelvis and calyces markedly compressed by this mass. It is unclear as to whether  
the mass arises from the pelvic urothelium or the surrounding parenchyma.

Gross Description:  
Received in a single formalin filled container labeled with the patient's name and additionally labeled ""left 
kidney."" The specimen consists  
of the product of a radical nephrectomy with a marked amount of perinephric fat  
with overall dimensions of 30 x 25 x 12 cm. A portion of this tissue was  
procured with the tissue bank. The renal parenchyma has approximate dimensions  
of 11 x 5 x 6 cm. The specimen is remarkable for a tan -brown nodular, well  
circumscribed mass projecting off the lower pole of the kidney. This mass  has 
dimensions of 4.5 x 4.5 x 3 cm. This mass is grossly confined to the renal  
parenchyma. This mass is greater than 4 cm from the nearest soft tissue edge.  
This tumor is greater than 2 cm from the renal sinus. This lesion grossly does  
not involve any major vessels. The kidney is also remarkable for at least ten  
additional lesions. These lesions range in size from 0.1 to 0.9 cm in greatest  
dimension. These lesions are all present in the cortex involving lower, mid and  
upper poles. The lesions are all yello w-brown and relatively well circumscribed.  
 All of these lesions are confined to the renal parenchyma and do not involve the  
sinus fat, perinephric fat or large vessels.  
 
The tissue is submitted as follows:  
     1     vascular and ureteral margins;  
     2-3      sections of largest tumor to capsule;  
     4-5      additional sections of largest tumor to include parenchyma;

The examination of this case material and the preparation of this report were
performed by the staff pathologist. Note:
A section taken from the renal vein at the resection margin shows the tumor
thrombus. The thrombus is adherent to the vein wall at this point and this is
considered to represent a positive surgical margin.
Gross Description:
Received is a single formalin filled container labeled with the patient's name
and additionally labeled ""left radical nephrectomy and caval
thrombus with hilar and retroperitoneal lymph nodes.""
Specimen components and dimensions: The specimen consists of the product of a
left radical nephrectomy with left kidney, left renal pelvis and a part of the
left renal vein. There is an abundant amount of perinephric fat attached that
contains the left adrenal gland. The specimen has been previously opened to
reveal the tumor. The specimen aggregately measures 25 x 19 x 7 cm in greatest
dimension. The renal parenchyma measures 11.5 x 9 x 5.4 cm in greatest
dimension. The ureter is attached and measures 12.2 cm in length and 0.3 cm in
diameter. The adrenal gland measures 8 x 4.5 x 1.4 cm in greatest dimension and
weighs 20.3 g.
Size, appearance, and location of tumor: The tumor is pink-tan to brown in
color with hemorrhagic areas .Ithas a variegated surface and almost entirely
replaces the renal parenchyma. It measures 11 x 6.5 x 4.5 cm in greatest
dimension. The tumor involves the renal sinus, the renal sinus fat and the renal
pelvis grossly and extends into the renal vein with a protruding thrombus
measuring 6.5 cm in length beyond the renal vein margin.
Renal capsule/renal sinus: The renal sinus is completely replaced by the tumor
mass. The tumor approaches the renal capsule, however no invasion is grossly
identified. The renal capsule strips with ease.
Renal vein: The renal vein is occluded by the tumor mass , thrombus. The tumor
thrombus extends beyond the renal vein margin by 7 cm.
Lymph nodes (size, number, & location): The perihilar fat has been dissected
for lymph nodes with at least eight lymph nodes identified grossly. The rest of
the fat is placed in a clearing agent.

The tumor is predominantly papillary in architecture with cells that mainly have
an abundant cytoplasm that ranges from completely eosinophilic to clear.
Although ,the morphologic features in general are in favor of papillary renal
cell carcinoma type I, the cytological features of ""clear cells"" are concerning
for clear cell papillary renal cell carcinoma. Immunohistochemical studies
showed that the tumor cells are positive for cytokeratin 7, racemase, carbonic
anhydrase and vimentin and are negative for TFE3 and SDHB .Controls stained
appropriately .The immunohistochemical profile and morphologic features are
consistent with the diagnosis of renal papillary carcinoma type I. Dr .has reviewed the case and
concurs with the diagnosis.

The examination of this case material and the preparation of this report were
performed by the staff pathologist.
Gross Description:
The specimen is received in formalin labeled with the patient name and additionally labeled, ""right kidney""
and consists of a kidney received
with abundant perinephric fibroadipose tissue. The kidney has dimension of 11.5
x 7 x 5 cm. The attached ureter has a length of 5 cm and diameter of 0.4 cm. The
specimen is received partially inked and partially incised. Sectioning through
the specimen reveals a tan-brown, lobulated, fairly well-delineated mass in the
mid portion of the kidney that has dimensions of 4.8 x 3.7 x 3.5 cm. This mass
involves the renal sinus fat, focally abuts the wall at the renal vein and focally extends to the renal capsule. The mass does not appear to extend beyond
the renal capsule. The mass has a hemorrhagic, degenerative cut surface. A
portion of the mass has been submitted to the Tissue Bank. Adjacent to
the mass is a cortical cyst that is 0.8 cm in greatest dimension that contains
tan-brown fluid. The cyst lining is predominately smooth. There is a tan-white,
well-delineated nodule that is 1.2 cm from the mass that has dimensions of 0.3 x
0.2 x 0.2 cm. The remaining, uninvolved renal parenchyma is pink-tan to
red-brown with a fairly well-delineated corticomedullary junction. The thickness
of the cortex is up to 1.2 cm. The collecting system is lined by pink-tan,
granular mucosa. The capsule strips with some difficulty revealing a red-brown
to pink-tan, nodular surface.
The hilar fat is removed and has a weight of 15 g. Sectioning reveals no
definitive lymph nodes.
Representative sections are submitted as follows:
1hilar margins en face;
2,3 mass to inked external surface;
4mass to capsule;
5mass to renal sinus fat;
6mass to renal sinus fat and wall of renal vein;

- No malignancy identified
Comment:
The tumor is a high grade pleomorphic sarcoma involving the
upper pole of the
kidney. While the tumor appears mostly confined to the kidney,
the tumor focally
invades through the renal capsule to involve perinephric fat,
and is very close
(within 1 mm) to the Gerota' s fascia/perinephric fat margin.
The tumor also
abuts the adrenal gland, and involves the medulla of the adrenal
gland through
direct extension. The superior medial aspect of the tumor was
partially
disrupted, and tumor focally extends to ink in the area of
disruption.
The differential diagnosis for this high grade sarcoma includes
dedifferentiated
liposarcoma and pleomorphic leiomyosarcoma. The tumor is
positive for desmin,
CD34, CD10, and vimentin, results which are non-specific and may
be seen in
either tumor type. There are focal abnormal cells within the
fatty tissue and
fibrous bands adjacent to the sarcoma (slides A17 and A19),

Referral testing for MDM2 gene amplification testing is being
requested and the
results will be reported in an addendum. MDM2 is amplified in
well-differentiated liposarcomas and some dedifferentiated
liposarcomas, and may
be helpful in determining if the sarcoma has an adipocytic
origin.
The case was discussed with Dr. onDrs. and
have reviewed the case and agree with the diagnosis of high
grade pleomorphic sarcoma.
Clinical History:
-year-old with a left renal mass.
Gross Description:
Received are two appropriately labeled containers. Specimen A:
Specimen fixation: Formalin
Type of specimen: Nephrectomy
Side of specimen: Left
Size and weight of specimen: 1,720 grams, 29 x 19 x 10 cm
overall with
a 15 x 9 x 9 cm kidney, 8 cm of attached ureter and abundant
attached
perinephric fat.
Orientation: The external surface is inked blue and there is a 6
cm full thickness defect exuding tumor tissue along the superior
medial aspect
of the specimen. The edges of this defect are marked with yellow
ink for
identification purposes.
Presence/absence of adrenal gland: Adrenal gland is present (5.7
x 2.0 x 0.5
cm)
Tumor site: The tumor is present in the superior pole and
extends
medially and superiorly.
Tumor description: The tumor is a fleshy gray/tan friable mass
lining a dominant cyst. The edges of the cyst are focally fleshy
and more solid
appearing. The tumor has a markedly mucinous component.
Tumor size: 14 x 11 x 10 cm
Presence /absence of multicentricity: Absent
Confinement/non-confinement to the kidney: Indeterminate due to
the
disrupted nature of the superior medial aspect. The tumor
appears partially
encapsulated and well-demarcated from the perinephric fat and
adjacent renal
parenchyma of the inferior pole.
Extent of invasion: Perirenal adipose tissue: Tumor grossly does not involve
Gerota' s fascia: Tumor grossly does not involve.
Renal vein: Tumor grossly does not involve.
Ureter: Tumor grossly does not involve.
Renal Sinus: Tumor grossly does not involve.
Pelvicaliceal: Tumor grossly does not involve.
Adrenal: Tumor grossly involves the medulla of the
adrenal. The adrenal cortex is a thin rim of orange parenchyma
and
unremarkable. Tumor grossly abuts the adrenal gland.
Other organs: N/A
Surgical margins:
Perirenal adipose tissue: Within <0.1 cm of the blue inked
surgical
margin.
Renal vein: Negative
Renal artery: Focally encased at the hilum but negative.
Ureter: Negative
Description of kidney away from tumor: Gray/tan with a cortical
thickness of
0.8 cm.

Addendum for specimen A:
Addendum Comment
Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for MDM2 gene
amplification was
performed at on the tumor tissue (slide A13).
The FISH
results show an MDM2 amplification with an MDM2/SE12 ratio of
2.71. Per their
protocol, MDM2/SE12 ratios greater than 2.0 are considered
amplified. While
FISH for MDM2 gene amplification is intended to differentiate
well-differentiated liposarcomas/atypical lipomatous tumors from
lipomas, gene
amplification in this tumor suggests that this tumor has
lipocytic
differentiation."," Site: Left kidney (based on the description of the surgical procedure)

Laterality: Left

Histology: MDM2 gene amplified tumor with lipocytic differentiation (as indicated by the FISH results)

Stage: Not provided

Grade: Not provided

Behavior: Malignant, as it is a tumor with mucinous component and adrenal gland involvement. Additionally, it is partially encapsulated but invades the medulla of the adrenal gland.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GROSS DESCRIPTION
A.Received in formalin labeled ""left kidney"" is a specimen consisting of
a left kidney surrounded by an envelope of fibroadipose tissue measuring
20.5 x 9.6 x 7.0 cm and weighing 740 grams. The kidney measures 13.5 x 6.8
x 5.0 cm. The kidney demonstrates an 8.5 x 6.5 x 6.5 cm tan soft and
friable mass in the.upper and mid poles of the kidney. Extensive necrosis
is identified. Focal hemorrhage is seen. The mass grossly involves the
renal sinus fat. The overlying renal pelvis is unremarkable. The mass
bulges the renal capsule however does not extend into the surrounding
fibroadipose tissue. It is adjacent to the inked soft tissue line of
resection. The tumor is sharply demarcated from the renal parenchyma which
appears tan-white and pale. Satellite nodules of tumor are not present.
Sectioning of the renal veins, particularly those draining the area of the
mass does show the intravascular presence of neoplasm. The mass grossly
involves the renal vein margin. An adrenal gland i s present measuring 5.8 x
2.6 x 1.0 cm and is not involved by tumor. The adrenal cortex is
yellow-orange and unremarkable. A 5 cm segment of ureter is present and is
essentially unremarkable. Lymph nodes are not seen .Representative
sections are submitted as follows: Al ureter margin; A2 artery margin; A3
renal vein margin with mass; A4 - AS mass with renal sinus and renal
pelvis; A6 - A7 mass with soft tissue line of resection; A8 - A10 mass; All
uninvolved kidney; A12 adrenal.
B.Received in formalin labeled ""retroaortic vein"" is a segment of
vascular tissue measuring 3.5 cm in length and 0.9 cm in diameter. The
lumen is occluded by tan soft and friable tissue. The tissue extends to
Page 2of 3 41PNIMMUMIMMv
within 0.5 cm of one margin and is at the opposite margin. Focal
hemorrhage and necrosis is identified. The tissue is firmly adhered to the
interior vascular walls. Representative sections are submitted as follows:
B1 involved margin; B2 opposite margin; B3 representative section.
C.Received in formalin labeled ""wallmargin"" are three segments of
tan-gray vascular wailaggregating to 1.6 x 1.4 x 0.5 cm. The wall appears
unremarkable .The specimen is totally submitted in formalin in C1.
D.Received in formalin labeled ""thrombus"" are multiple fragments of
tan-brown soft and friable tissue aggregating to 5 x 5 x 2.6 cm. A segment
of vascular tissue is identified measuring 4.3 cm in length and 2.8 cm in
diameter. The lumen is occluded by tan soft and friable tissue. The
tissue demonstrates focal hemorrhage and necrosis. Representative sections
are submitted in formalin in D1 - D3.
E.Received in formalin labeled ""paracaval lymph nodes"" are multiple
fragments of yellow-brown fibroadipose tissue aggregating to 4.3 x 3.8 x
1.7 cm. Sectioning reveals multiple ovoid tan firm nodules resembling
lymph nodes ranging in size from 0.4 to 1.7 cm. The nodules are submitted
as follows: El four nodules; E2 three nodules; E3 two nodules.

COMMENT
This tumor focally has clear cell changes. By immunohistochemistry, these
clear cells are negative for cytokeratin 7, similar to conventional clear
cell RCC, while the rest of the papillary RCC is positive for this marker.
The significance of finding a small component of clear cell RCC in an
otherwise papillary RCC is unknown.

renal sinus , and is not present at the soft tissue margin of the specimen.
The closest soft tissue margin is approximately 2 cm from the tumor.
Satellite nodules of tumor are not present in the renal tissue. Dissection
of the renal veins does not show intravascular presence of neoplasm. The
renal parenchyma is pale ,with blurred corticomedullary demarcations.
There is one large cyst present in the superior pole and several much
smaller cysts scattered throughout the renal parenchyma. The cysts are
lined by a smooth wall and are filled with clear fluid. The largest cyst
measures 2.0 cm in largest diameter and the smaller cysts range in size
from 0.2 to 0.5 cm in diameter. A partially fragmented adrenal gland is
visible on the surface of the specimen measuring 5.5 x 1.2 x 1.0 cm and
weighing 5.6 grams. The adrenal is without nodules but is somewhat
hemorrhagic . It does not appear involved by the mass ,and the closest
portion of mass is approximately 7 cm distant. A 5.0 cm segment of ureter
is present and is essentially unremarkable. Lymph nodes are not present.
Representative sections are submitted as follows: Al frozen section no
charge; A2 vascular margins and ureter margin; A3 representative sections
of adrenal; A4 & AS tumor nearest soft tissue margin ;A6 tumor nearest
renal sinus; A7 tumor nearest renal pelvis; A8 tumor and adjacent kidney;
A9 tumor; Al 0 representative section normal kidney and representative

2.5 x 2 x 2 cm. The mass grossly appears to be pushing the
capsule.Adjacent to the mass is a 2.5 cm cystic structure that
is. linewith a tan, glistening and grossly unremarkable tissue
with no excrescences.The mass measures to the UP junction of
the specimen 3.8 cm. The remainder of the cut surface reveals
several additional cortical cystic structures ranging in size
from 0.11 cm down to 0.2 cm. Further sectioning the kidney, on
the opp site pole of the massthe cut surface reveals a smooth
0.5 cmodule measuring to the capsule and fatty tissue 0.8 cm.
The remainder of the cut surface is grossly unremarkable. No
adrenal gland was identified in the specimen. Representative

1) The specimen is received fresh, labeled ""Right kidney and 
part of right adrenal"". It consists of nephrectomy specimen 
including kidney, attached perinephric fatty tissue and portion 
of adrenal, measuring 16.5 x 11.8 x 6.6 cm overall and weighing 
770 grams. The attached portion of adrenal measure s 5 x 0.8 x 
0.5 cm. Also attached to the kidney is a segment of ureter , 
measuring 7.5 cm in length by 0.4 cm in diameter . Present at the 
middle portion slightly towards to the upper pole and on the 
lateral aspect is a bosselated , slightly lobulated tumor mass, 
measuring 10.9 x 9.9 x 5.4 cm. On cut surface , the mass shows 
purple-pink-tan lobulated, soft periphery with foci of 
hemorr hagic necrosis and a central fibrosis . The mass which

involves renal cortex and medulla, is grossly impinging on the 
pelvis . The renal capsule grossly is not involved by tumor. 
Examination of the hilar vessels reveal the vascular lumen to be 
filled by tumor thrombus. The ureteral mucosa grossly is pink­
tan and smooth. The uninvolved renal parenchyma is purple -white 
without addition al lesion. Within the hilar area and perinephric 
fatty tissue, no lymph nodes are identified . Sectioni ng of 
adrenal shows yellow-golden granular nodule, 1.0 x 0.8 x 0.5 em.

3. ""Histology"": renal cell carcinoma, chromophobe type. As stated in the report, the tumor was identified as a renal cell carcinoma with a chromophobe pattern of growth.
4. ""Stage"": T2 N0 M0. The tumor invaded the renal pelvis (T2), but there is no evidence of lymph node or distant metastasis, as stated in the report.
5. ""Grade"": not provided. The report does not mention any details about the differentiation level of the tumor cells.
6. ""Behavior"": malignant.

radical nephrectomy spec men composed of kidney and perirenal fat measuring 30.0 x 12.0 x 10.0 em and weighing 2252 gm. 
After bivalving the specimen a kidney measuring 21.0 x 11.0 x 8.8 em reveals at the upper pole a 13.0 x 12.0 x 10.0 em partially 
necrotic yellow-Ian cenlraly scarred tumor. The tumor appears to be well-encapsulated but pushes into the perirenal fat. Gross 
no evidence of capsule breakthroug h Is noted. Tumor appears to also deform and abut the calyceal pelvic system with no 
breakthrough. Serial sectioning of the tumor reveals a hemorrhagic multiple variegated yellow-tan and red tumor with a central 
area of scarring. Section:ng through the hilar fat reveals multiple lymph nodes. A 14.3 x 0.5 em attached ureter is identified 
which probe patent and negative for lesions. The ureteral margin is shaved and submitted together wilh the vacular margins 
which appear also grossly negative. Sectioning through the perirenal fat reveals a 3.8 )( 2.8 )( 1.2 cm adrenal gland which abuts 
the superior surface of the tumor. The tumor appears not to invade the adrenal gland. Gross photographs are taken and TPS is 
taken.

"," 1. ""Site"": Right kidney. Justified as the report clearly mentions a right kidney mass and the surgical pathology confirms the removal of the right kidney.
2. ""Laterality"": Not applicable for this report as it's about a single kidney, not a pair of organs.
3. ""Histology"": Renal cell carcinoma, chromophobe type. Justified by the pathology report which describes a ""markedly necrotic pink tan tumor"" with a ""septated cystic appearance"" and ""focal hemorrhagic calcified areas"", consistent with a chromophobe renal cell carcinoma.
4. ""Stage"": Not provided in the details given. The TNM stage would require additional information such as the size of the tumor, involvement of regional lymph nodes, and distant metastasis.
5. ""Grade"": Not provided in the details given. The grade typically refers to how abnormal the cancer cells look under a microscope and is often represented by a grade from 1 to 4.

1), The specimen is received fresh, labeled ""Righi kidney, Perihilar node en bloc, and right adrenal"" and consists of a total 
nephrectomy specimen w""th attached perinephric fat , renal vessels, ureter, adrenal gland and perihilar nodes weighing 1098 9 post 
fixation. The kidney measures 16.3 x 12.5 x 7.9 em. The attached ureter measures 9.4 em in length and 0.3 em in diameter. 
The adrenal gland measures 5.3 x 1.4 x 1.1 em. The ureter and vessel margins are identified, and appear pink tan-pink and 
grossly uninvolved by tumor. In the area of the hilum, few loosely attached possible lymph nodes are identified ranging in size 
from 0.4 10 1.4 em in greatest dimension. The capsular surface of the kidney is pink-tan and smooth, and appears grossly 
uninterrupted. The specmen is bisected to reveal a well-<:ircumsctibed pseudoencapsulated red-tan focally hemorrhagic soft 
tumor mass measuring 9.5 x B.9 x 7.B em, occupying the superior and mid pole of the kidney. The mass extends to but does not 
appear to grossly involve the renal pelvis. On cut section, roughly at the center of the tumor mass, an ill-defined paler white tan 
finely granular and slightly indurated area is identified measuring 5.5 x 2.5 em in greatest dimensio n with ill-defined areas of focal 
hemorrhage also noted. The remainder of the mass is soft tan and focally hemorrhag ic with liquefactive necrotic appearing areas 
noted. A thin rim of focaDy hemorrhagic pink· tan a firm possible renal parenchyma is identified partially surrounding the tumor. 
Sections of theperi-nephrt fatty tissue reveal an unremarkable cut surface. The ureter is opened to reveal pink-tan corrugated 
mucosa with no discrete abnormalities grossly noted. The inferior renal sinus is grossly unremal1table On cut section, the adrenal 
gland is grossly unremarkable . At the inferior pole of the kidney, the cortical medullary junction is well delineated with a cortex 
measuring up to 1 em. Further sectioning reveals a 0.8 em smooth walled cyst at the inferior pole. The remaining renal 
parenchyma is pink brown and unremarkable . Representative sections of the specimen are submitted for for permanent 
section, and photographs have been taken.

Gross Description: 
1). The specimen is received fresh, labeled ""right radical nephrectomy"" and consists of a kidney with attached ureter, renal 
vessels and perinephric fal weighing 771 9 in total. The kidney measures 12 x 7 x 6 em. The attached ureter measures 8.5 em in 
length and 0.2 em in diameter. The attached renal vein measures 0.2 em in length and 0.5 em in diameter. The renal vessels 
and ureter margins are grossly unremarkable. An adrenal gland is not identified. The kidney is inked black and bivalved to reveal 
a 11 x 9 x 7 cm necrotic, lobulated yellow and hemorrhagic mass in the lower pole extending to the mid kidney and renal pelvis. 
The mass entirely replaces the lower portion of the kidney. The mass grossly extends to the renal capsule but does not penetrate 
through it. The mass appears to extend into the perihilar fat. Sections through the remainder of the kidney reveal a pink·brown 
parenchyma, with a well·defined cortico·medullary junction. The cortex measures 0.2 cm and the calyces appear normal. No 
lymph nodes are identified in the perinephric fat. Representative sections are submitted for TPS and for permanent sections.

matches the above description. The adipose tissue and hilar region is inked in black. The ureter is identified and 
measures 6 cm in length and up to 0.4 cm in diameter. Upon sectioning, it appears that the tumor has invaded 
the hilum and the perirenal, perihilar fat. Large vessels and ureter appear grossly free of tumor. In the anterior 
aspect of the kidney, there is an area of adhesion between the capsule and the tumor, suspicious for invasion of 
perirenal fat. Very small amounts of adrenal tissue measuring 2 x 0.3 cm is identified in the upper pole.

GROSS DESCRIPTION: The specimen is received is a single container labeled with.the patient's name, 
medical record number, and ""right kidney and Gerota's fascia"". The specimen consists of a nephrectomy 
weighing 215.1 grams and measuring 12 x 10 x 4 cm in dimension. No palpable mass is present. The surgical 
margin is inked in black and bivalved via the antehilar surface to reveal a kidney-colored nodule measuring 2.1 
x 1.5 cm at the corticomedullary junction. 'The tumor is greater than 2 cm from the closest surgical margin and 
is well circumscribed. A 1 x 1 cm piece of nodule and a 1 x 1 cm piece of normal-appearing parenchyma is 
procured for UOB. Photographs have been taken of the case. The procurement was performed by
 In Surgical Pathology, the specimen is received in a formalin-filled container. The 
specimen has been previously bivalved and half of the tumor has been shelled out. The remainder of the 
tumor is located at the corticomedullary junction: Cut sectioning of the tumor demonstrates a browr~ish, normal- 
appearing kidney parenchyma surrounding the nodular tan-brown tumor mass. Deep to the tumor within the 
cortex is a clear fluid-filled cortical cyst. On half of the kidney which was previously procured, the tumor 
appears to infiltrate into the normal-appearing kidney parenchyma with pushing borders in a very thin white 
caps~~le surrounding the tumor from the normal kidney. The tumor does not appear to involve the hilum and is 
0.3 cm from the hilar edge of the kidney, and 0.4 cm from the perinephric fat. The vascular and ureteral 
margins are grossly free of tumor. Sectioning through the remainder of the kidney demonstrates brown-tan, 
unremarkable kidney parenchyma with no additional nodules are mass is seen. There is no perinephric fat 
surrounding the capsule of the kidney deep to 'the tumor nodule. Sectioning through the hilar fat demonstrates 
no lymph node candidates. Analysis of the renal artery demonstrates an area of atherosclerosis which is 
approximately 60% occluded. There are no additional nodules or masses seen in the perinephric fat.

Received at Surgical Pathology is a formalin -filled container labeled
with the patient 's name ,medical record number, date of birth, and
further designated as:
1. ""Portion left adrenal gland "".The specimen consists of an
adrenal gland segment measuring 4 x I x 1 cm. There is no
palpable nodule within the specimen. The specimen Is serially
sectioned and submitted entirely in 5 white cassettes labeled as
iA 1E.
2. ""Left kidney"" .The specimen consists of an intact kidney with
attached perinephric fat measuring 16 x 9 x 6 cm and weighing 343
grams collectively .The isolated kidney measures 14.8 x 8.4 x 5.5
cm and weighs 305 grams. The perirenal fat capsule is Inked with
black .Extending from the renal pelvis are 2 ureters .The upper
ureter is 5 cm in length and 0 .4 cm in diameter .The lower ureter
is 8 cm In length and 0 .5 cm in diameter .Renal vein is 0.5 cm in
length and 0.6 cm in diameter and the upper renal artery branch is
1.8 cm In length and 0.5 cm in diameter, the lower one is 1.0 cm
In length and 0 .4 cm in diameter .The perirenal fat layer is
stripped ,revealing the intact renal. capsule ,which is Inked blue.
Tumor does not extend to the ureters ,arteries, and vein and is
not present at the resection margin .The kidney is bisected,
revealing an 8 x 7 x 4 cm circumscribed solid pink mass without
hemorrhage and necrosis in the upper pole of the left kidney. It
is 1.0 cm from the renal hilum .The mass is confined by the renal
capsule and does not Invade the perinephric fat. The uninvolved
renal parenchyma Is tan -brown with a well-defined cortical
medullary junction and orderly cortical striations and medullary
raise.The pelvis and calyx appear smooth. There are no lymph
nodes or stones Identified .Gross photographs are taken. In the
upper pole, there is a 0.5 -cm erythematic area, presumably the
core biopsy site. Representative sections are submitted as
follows:
A-D - relationship between tumor and the renal capsule
E-G - relationship between tumor and the pelvis
