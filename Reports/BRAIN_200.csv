SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 
1. Right insular tumor: astrocytoma with mitotic activity. see 
comment. 
2. Right insular tumor: astrocytoma with mitotic activity. see 
comment. 
Comment:  TCGA-CS-4942 
The tumor in specimens #1 and #2 contains fibrillary astrocytoma 
composed of moderately pleomorphic fibrillary astrocytes. Rare but 
multiple mitoses are present in both specimens #1 and #2. Two mitotic 
f; ·1res are identified in specimen #1 (slide 18) and two mitotic 
tol:1ures are identified in specimen #2 (slide 28). The proliferation 
index as determined by Ki67 (MI8-1) staining is greater than 5% in 
small foci of specimen #2 (slide 2A). The identification of rare 
mitoses and a focally elevated proliferation index suggest that this 
astrocytic tumor is an astrocytoma (WHO grade II) in the process of 
transformation to a higher grade tumor or that these tumor biopsies are 
from a higher grade tumor. Clinical correlation recommended.

TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT promoter have been shown to
benefit
from therapy with alkylating agents .Assessment of MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite
treatment of
DNA followed by real-time PCR amplification of methylated and unmethylated DNA
sequences. The
analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by serial dilution of methylated positive control DNA into
unmethylated DNA, and was assessed to be 1 % of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated
DNA. Factors
such as the presence of >50% non-neoplastic cells in the sample, or extensive tissue necrosis, may
preclude the
detection of methylated MGMT promoter sequences.
FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a stand alone diagnostic
test. This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the
as required
by CLIA ' 88 regulations .Ithas not been cleared or approved for specific uses by the U. S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA). The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
IMMUNOHI STOCHEMISTRY: The GFAP demonstrates a glial fibrillary background.
About 25% of the neoplastic cells over express the p53 protein. With the
MIB-1, there is a proliferation index of about 14% in the more active areas.
These immuno features support the diagnosis of high histological grade
astrocytoma.

Microscopy:
Histological sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin showed fragments of
neocortex with diffuse infiltration by low-grade glial neoplasm ,mainly located in the
white matter, which consists of distinct phenotype cells, which present interspersed
among themselves.
The predominant cell pattern is represented by rounded cell nuclei with delicate and
granular chromatin ,with inconspicuous nucleoli .The cytoplasm is scarce, with
imprecise limits. It can be observed in some areas ,the presence of perinuclear halos.
These cells infiltrate the adjacent cortex ,committing up to layer I ,with frequent neuronal
sattelitosis.
The other cell component ,with lesser quantity of cells is represented by irregular and
sometimes elongated nuclei ,with dense chromatin and eosinophilic cytoplasm with
imprecise limits.
The tumor shows areas with increased cellularity ,inwhich the neuropil displays
rarefaction and eventual microcysts .Mitotic figures are rare .Itwas not observed
vessels with microvascular proliferation and / or necrotic foci.
PER-OPERATIVE
Smears show ,insent fragments ,diffuse low-grade glial neoplasm ,consisting of
elongated nuclei cells with mild dyskaryosis in a rich fibrillar plot .It is note also some
round nuclei cells .There are some eosinophilic and amorphous structures ,suggesting
Rosenthal fibers ,but not conclusive.
Conclusion :Low-grade glioma ,in this material.
Diagnosis:
Resection product of brain lesion in the left temporal region:
-Oligoastrocitoma ,grade IIWHO (ICD-O 9382/3).
NOTE:
-The oligodendroglial component is predominant in this material.
Award of 1 p/1 9q deletion analysis: The hybridizations were performed on 5 micrometers thick sections of formalin-fixed
and paraffin-embedded neoplastic tissue (FFPE) in the most representative tumor area
with Ip36/1g25 and 19g13/19p13 probe. 100 to 200 were evaluated in each
slide cores.
In this case: The ratio of signals from 1p/1q probes was 0 ,58. The ratio of signals from
19q/19p probes was 0,62. Conclusion: Diffuse oligoastrocitoma grade IIWHO with co-
deletion of 1p/19q.

Anaplastic astrocytOifia. MIB--l proliferation index: 15%. 
See commp.nt. 
COMMENT 
Specimen A is small fragments of a glial neoplastic proliferation with 
nuclear 
anaplasia and mitotic figures sprinkled throughout the tumor. 
Specimen B is 
large fragments of brain infiltrated and effaced by a similar glial 
proliferation with an astrocyte phenotype, marked nuclear anaplasia, 
and brisk 
mitotic activity. 
The MIB-l proliferation index is about 15%. There is focal (cortical) 
microvascular calcification, but microvascular cellular proliferation 
and 
necrosis are inconspicuous. 
The morphological findings are interpreted as an anaplastic glioma,  predominantly astrocytoma, with perhaps a minor oligodendroglial 
component 
(part A).

'.THOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS: 
_'ain, right cerebral tumor, excision: Gliosarcoma with ependymal 
differentiation (comment). 
COMMENT He has a 
uid level and 
The Ki-67 labeling index is up to approximately 75% within the nodules. p53 
staining is negative. 
The MGMT promoter methylation assay is negative (see below). There is evidence 
of Ip deletion (see below). 
Three cases of gliosarcoma thought to arise in an ependymoma (2 after 
treatment) have been published. Since osteoid and cartilage can occur in 
posterior fossa ependymomas, it is possible that this tumor may show some 
biological overlap with anaplastic ependymoma.

Interpretation 
Findings are suggestive of allelic loss on chromosome arm lp. 
There is no evidence of allelic loss on chromosome arm 19q . 
• formative loci are: D1S552, D1S468, D1S1612, D19S412, PLA2G4C, D19S606,

Results-Comments 
Testing performed on tumor paraffin block  (31) and peripheral blood 
for germline comparison. 
TEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA 
(baseline)/ Tumor DNA pairs using 3 markers at both 1p and 19q. The 3 markers 
on 1p are D1S548, 0181592, and D1S552 (with D1S468, D181612, and D1S496 as 
backup markers) and the 3 markers on 19q are D19S219, D19S412, and PLA2G4C 
(with D19S606 and D19S1182 as backup). All markers are rnicrosatellites (2 or 4 
nt repeats) except PLA2G4C which is a minisatellite (26 nt repeat) 
polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score, 
amplicon size, .and ease of interpretation. The backup markers are used if .the 
first line markers at that chromosome arm are uninformative or otherwise 
ambiguous in their interpretation. LOR at all informative loci on each 
chromosomal arm represents the typical finding in oligodendrogliomas with Ip 
and 19q deletion.

TECHNICAL SENSITIVITY: The presence of >15% non-neoplastic cells in the sample 
may preclude the detection of allelic loss.

 PRINCIPLE: Among the major subtypes of gliomas, oligodendrogliomas are 
istinguished by their remarkable sensitivity to chemotherapy, with 
approximately 70% of anaplastic (malignant) oligodendrogliomas responding 
dramatically t azine, lornustine, and vincristine 
(termed PCV) ( Unfortunately, no clinical or 
pathologic feature allows accurate prediction of chemotherapeutic response. 
Oligodendrogliomas are also associated with a longer average patient survival 
as compared to astrocytic tumors. However, the histologic distinction between 
oligodendroglioma and astrocytoma is often highly subjective, and there has 
been significant interobserver variation.

statistically significant and currently the best predictor of chemosensitivity 
combined loss involving chromosome arms Ip and 19q predicts both 
chemotherapeutic response and longer survival in patients with oligodendrogliomas

2. Negative for co -deletion of chromosomal arms 1 p and 19q
3. Positive for mutant IDHI -RI 32H protein by immunostain g 124 /13
See comment.
Comment
The portions of cerebrum are diffusely infiltrated and focally effaced by a glial neoplastic proliferation. In
part A, the
non-enhancing tumor is diffusely infiltrative, and sparsely to moderately cellular. In part B, the tumor tends
to be more
solid, with hypercellular areas .The infiltrating cells have oval to elongated and spindle-shaped nuclei. The
immunostain for the mutant IDH1-R132H protein is diffusely positive. There are foci with brisk mitotic
activity and the
Ki-671 MIB-1 proliferation index is up to approximately 13% in the most active areas . Foci of
microvascular
proliferation are also identified, highlighted by the CD34 immunostain and in negative relief by the GFAP
immunostain. There is no tumor necrosis seen in these sections.
Overall, this high histological grade diffuse glioma is most consistent with glioblastoma, WHO grade 4.

H and E slide was examined and tumor DNA was enriched by microdissection
TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT promoter have been shown to
benefit from therapy with alkylating agents .Assessment of MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfate
treatment of
DNA followed by real-time PCR amplification of methylated and unmethylated DNA
sequences. The
analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by serial dilution of methylated positive control DNA into
unmethylated DNA, and was assessed to be 1% of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated
DNA. Factors
such as the presence of >50 % non- neoplastic cells in the sample, or extensive tissue necrosis, may
preclude the
detection of methylated MGMT promoter sequences.

Date Ordered: IIIIIIIIIIIII Date Reported: 
Interpretation 
NEGATIVE -No evidence of EGFRvIII mutation is detected 
Results-Comments 
TEST DESCRIPTION: Testing performed on RNA extracted from tissue block 
H slide was examined and no microdissection was 
needed. 
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an attractive molecular 
target 
in glioblastoma because it is amplified/ overexpressed/ and/or mutated 
in·up 
to ""40%"" to 50% of patients. Epidermal growth factor receptor variant 
III 
(EGFRvIII) is an oncogenic, constitutively active mutant form of EGFR 
that is 
commonly expressed in glioblastoma. Cell culture and in vivo models of 
glioblastoma have demonstrated EGFRvIII as defining prognostically 
distinct 
sub~roups of ·""glioblastomas. Additionally I the presence of EGFRvIII has 
been 
shown to sensitize tumors to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors when the 
tumor 
suppressor protein PTEN is intact. RNA is extracted from formalin 
fixed, 
paraffin embedded tissue samples and reverse transcribed to cDNA. The 
cDNA is 
then amplified using standard PCR technique for DNA templates. PCR 
products 
are detected by gel electrophoresis. The limit of detection of this 
assay has 
been determined to be approximately 5 mutant cells in 100 normal 
cells.

TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT

Assessment of 
MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite treatment of DNA 
followed 
by real-time PCR amplification (MethyLight) of methylated and

Factors such as the presence of >50% non-neoplastic cells in the

show a high-grade glioma demonstrating mitotic activity, microvascular 
proliferation and geographic necrosis. Many cells have round nuclei 
very much 
resembling an oligodendroglioma. Other cells aie more astrocyte- or 
gemistocytic astrocyte-like in appearance. Some cells are intermediate 
between 
mini-gemistocytes and classic gemistocytes. Hermelin slides are also 
examined 
and show some mucin pools. The tumor is diffusely p53 positive and the 
Ki-67 
labeling index is up to approximately 30%. Positive and negative

Loss of Heterozygosity 1p, 19q Assay (LOH) 
Date Ordered:  Date Reported: 
 Interpretation 
POSITIVE: Allelic loss on chromosome arm 19q is detected. 
No deletion of chromosome arm lp seen. 
Informative loci are: D1S548, D1S1592, D1S552, D19S219, and PLA2G4C 
Results-Comments 
Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block. 
DNA extracted from a corresponding blood specimen was used as normal 
reference 
control. 
H slide was examined and no microdissection was 
needed. 
TEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA 
(baseline)/ Tumor DNA pairs using 3 markers at both 1p and 19q. The 3 
markers 
on 1p are D1S548, D1S1592, and D1S552 (with D1S468, D1S1612, and 
D1S496 as 
backup markers) and the 3 markers on 19q are D19S219, D19S412, and 
PLA2G4C 
(with D19S606 and D19S1182 as backup) . All markers are microsatellites 
(2 or 4 
nt repeats) except PLA2G4C which is a minisatellite (26 nt repeat) 
polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score, 
amplicon size, and ease of interpretation. The backup markers are used 
if the 
first line markers at that chromosome arm are uninformative or 
otherwise 
ambiguous in their interpretation. LOH at all informative loci on each 
chromosomal arm represents the typical finding in oligodendrogliomas 
\iith 1p 
and 19q deletion.

to 40% to 50% of patients. Epidermal growth factor receptor variant 
III 
(EGFRviii) is an oncogenic, constitutively active mutant form of EGFR 
that is 
commonly expressed in glioblastoma. Cell culture and in vivo models of 
glioblastoma have demonstrated EGFRviii as defining prognostically 
distinct 
subgroups of glioblastomas. Additionally, the presence of EGFRviii has 
been 
shown to sensitize tumors to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors when the 
tumor 
suppressor protein PTEN is intact. RNA is extracted from formalin 
fixed, 
paraffin embedded tissue samples and reverse transcribed to eDNA. The 
eDNA is 
then amplified using standard PCR technique for DNA templates. PCR 
products 
are detected by gel electrophoresis. The limit of detection of this 
assay has 
been determined to be approximately 5 mutant cells in 100 normal 
cells.

The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an attractive molecular 
target 
in glioblastoma because it is amplified, overexpressed, and/or mutated 
in up 
to 40% to 50% of patients. Epidermal growth factor receptor variant 
III 
(EGFRvIII) is an oncogenic, constitutively active mutant form of EGFR 
that is 
commonly expressed in glioblastoma. Cell culture and in vivo models of 
glioblastoma have demonstrated EGFRvIII as defining prognostically 
distinct 
subgroups of glioblastomas. Additionally, the presence of EGFRvIII has 
been 
shown to sensitize tumors to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors when the 
tumor 
suppressor protein PTEN is intact. RNA is extracted from formalin 
fixed, 
paraffin embedded tissue samples and reverse transcribed to cDNA. The 
cDNA is 
then amplified using standard peR technique for DNA templates. peR

Results-Comments 
Testing performed on DNA extracted from manually micro dissected 
paraffin

TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT 
promoter 
have been shown to benefit from therapy with alkylating agents. 
Assessment of 
MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite treatment of DNA 
foll011ed 
by real-time PCR amplification (MethyLight) of methylated and 
unmethylated DNA 
sequences. The analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by 
serial 
dilution of methylated positive control DNA into unmethylated DNA, and 
was 
assessed to be 1% of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated 
DNA. 
Factors such as the presence of >50% non-neoplastic cells in the 
sample, or 
extensive tissue necrosis, may preclude the detection of methylated 
MGMT 
promoter sequences.

icroscopic  
 
Permanent section of frozen section demonstrates mildly hypercellular white matter.  The hypercellularity appears due to cells with mildly atypical angular nuclei with out apparent processes.  No mitotic figures are seen.  There is no 
microvascular proliferation or necrosis  
  Addendum  
 Sections demonstrate a modestly cellular glial neoplasm, a dense glial fibrillary stroma.  The tumor cells tend to be modestly clustered and sometimes oriented around vessels but well formed pseudorosettes are not seen.  There is no myxoid or microcystic change and no calcifications are present.  Nuclei are consistently round with modest atypia.  No mitotic figures are seen.  
 The neoplastic cells are diffusely immunoreactive for GFAP as is the fibrillary 
background.  There is no punctate cytoplasmic standing for EMA, strong evidence against ependymal or subependymal lineage.  Neurofilament stain demonstrates a gradation from normally filamentous at the periphery to only rare neurofilament posit ive axons centrally.  Nevertheless, this pattern does suggest 
an infiltrative process.  MIB -1 demonstrates only a very rare positive cell with an 
estimated labeling index of less than 0.1%.  Overall, this immunophenotype confirms the histologic impression of a very low grade but diffusely infiltrating 
astrocytic neoplasm

 Microscopic  
 Sections demonstrate a glial neoplasm that diffusely infiltrates both gray and white matter.  In the gray matter, there is prominent perineuronal satellitosis as well as subpial surface spread. Tumor cells have round nuclei with few apparent cytoplasmic processes.  Many demonstrate perinuclear halos.  There is little cytologic atypia.  No mitotic figures are seen.  There is no microvascular proliferation or necrosis.  
.  Addendum discussion : 
 Numerous MIB -1 reactive cells are present throughout the specimen.  A labeling index of 21% is 
calculated.  This is indicative of a markedly proliferative glial neoplasm.  Despite this, no mitotic figures are identified on the  stain and only a rare mitotic figure was indentified on the immunohistochemistry.  Consequently, the tumor must be classified as low grade/grade II. Nevertheless, the very high MIB -1 labeling index suggests more aggressive behavior.  Close 
clinical follow -up is indicated . 
 Final Addendum Diagnosis:  
 Oligodendroglioma, low grade, WHO grade II  
"," 1. ""Site"": The site is the brain, as the report specifically states that the sample is a glial neoplasm, which is a type of brain tumor.
2. ""Laterality"": Not provided, the report does not mention if the tumor is located in the left or right side of the brain.

COMMENT The specimens contain portions of a neoplastic proliferation of small glial 
cells, with nuclear anaplasia, mitotic figures, a very high proliferation 
index, microvascular cellular proliferation and necrosis, and zones of tumor 
necrosis with pseudopalisading. There are zones of hemorrhage, with prominent 
thrombosis of vessels. 
The phenotype of this high histological grade glioma (WHO grade IV) is 
predominantly astrocytic. These small cell glioblastomas are difficult to tell apart from malignant oligodendrogliomas. Determining the LOH status of 
this patient may better characterize the neoplasm.

MIB-1 proliferation index :Up to 6%.
See Microscopy Description and Comment.
Comment
The sections contain portions of cerebrum that are focally slight to moderately infiltrated by a glial
neoplastic
proliferation that has an oligodendroglial phenotype. There is one proliferation center where there is
mitotic activity
and a MIB-1 proliferation index of 6%; the proliferation index elsewhere is up to about 2%. There is not
endothelial
cell proliferation, microvascular cellular proliferation or tumor necrosis.
The neoplasm overall is a low histological grade oligodendroglioma (WHO 2). There is a proliferation
center in which
there is a moderately heightened mitotic and cycling activity. As an isolated finding the meaning of these
proliferation
centers is uncertain. They are not enough for upgrading the neoplasm; but may portend enhanced
biological activity,
and may perhaps be precursors of transformation.
The morphological features of this tumor may be correlated with clinical, imaging, and operative findings
for their
interpretation and patient's follow up.

Loss of Heterozygosity 1 p, 19q Assay (LOH) Date Ordered : Date Reported:
Interpretation
POSITIVE: Allelic loss on chromosome arm 1 p and chromosome arm 19q is detected.
Informative loci are :D1 S548 ,D1 S1592 ,D1 S552 ,D19S1182
Results -Comments
Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block DNA extracted from a
corresponding
blood specimen was used as a normal reference control.
Only one of 5 loci on chromosome 19q is informative .Based on LOH at DI 9S1182 , LOH of 1 p and
morphology of
oligodendroglioma ,findings are consistent with deletion of 19q as well. Clinical and morphologic
correlation is
recommended.
TEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA (baseline )/ Tumor DNA
pairs using 3
markers at both 1 p and 19q. The 3 markers on 1 p are D1 S548, D1 S1592 ,and D1 S552 (with D1 S468,
D1 S1612, and
D1S496 as backup markers )and the 3 markers on 19q are D19S219 ,D19S412 , and PLA2G4C (with
D19S606 and
D19SI 182 as backup). All markers are microsatellites (2 or 4 nt repeats )except PLA2G4C which is a
minisatellite (26
nt repeat )polymorphism .The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score, amplicon size, and
ease of
interpretation .The backup markers are used if the first line markers at that chromosome arm are
uninformative or
otherwise ambiguous in their interpretation .LOH at all informative loci on each chromosomal arm
represents the
typical finding in oligodendrogliomas with 1 p and 19q deletion.
FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a stand -alone diagnostic

TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT promoter have been shown to
benefit
from therapy with alkylating agents .Assessment of MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite
treatment of DNA followed by real-time PCR amplification of methylated and unmethylated DNA
sequences. The
analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by serial dilution of methylated positive control DNA into
unmethylated DNA, and was assessed to be 11 %of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated
DNA. Factors
such as the presence of >50 %non-neoplastic cells in the sample ,or extensive tissue necrosis, may
preclude the
detection of methylated MGMT promoter sequences.

Addendum Discussion:  
Only a rare MIB -1 positive cell is present, consistent with the low grade histologic 
features. The case is reviewed with who in addition to the astrocytic proliferation, notes disorganiza tion of neurons with some atpyia, as well as neurons and 
white matter, consistent with a background of cortical dysplasia.  
 
Addendum Diagnosis:  
Well- differentiated Astrocytoma, grade II in background of cortical dysplasia.  
 
Microscopic Description:  
Secti ons demonstrate a mildly to moderately hypercellular glial neoplasm that diffusely 
infiltrates white matter as well as gray matter. In the latter, focal perineuronal satellitosis is seen. The tumor predominantly resemble s gemistocytes, although some 
fibrillary astrocytes are seen. Although the nuclei tend to be round to oval, perinuclear halos or other definite indications of oligodendroglioma differentiation are not seen. Atypia is mild to moderate. No mitoses are in seen in 50 high power fields or on lower power scanning.

Comment: The histological profile and Ki-67 labelling index are consistent
with a low grade (WHO grade II) glial neoplasm. Though in many areas the
cells assume an oligodendroglial profile, in other areas more pleomorphic
elements with astrocytic appearance are present. More sections as well as
assays for Ip/19q deletions are pending and an addendum will be issued

The resultant FISH section/slide is scanned by a trained licensed
medical technologist and analyzed using a FDA-approved, validated
semi-automated scanning imaging workstation and accompanying imaginglocus of interest.
Number of Observers:
Test Interpreted By:
Comments analysis software .The resultant FISH section/slide is then
presented to the interpreting Pathologist, who will reviews the FISH
results from and compares them to the results manually observed
under Fluorescence Microscope. Therefore the ratio is enumerated
by computer-aided counting as well as manual counting.
Interpretation of Test
The ratio for probe set 1 is derived by dividing the total number of
1p36 signals by the total number of 1g25 signals in at least 20
interphase nuclei with
nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic glial cells. Cells with no
signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. The ratio for
probe set 2 is derived by dividing the total number of 19q13 signals by
the total number of 19p13 signals in at least 2 sets of 20 interphase
nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic glial cells at two
different areas of the sample. Cells with no signals or with signals of
only one color are disregarded. References ranges for our laboratory for
allelic loss versus no allelic loss were established by evaluating both
probe sets in a series of 40 normal cases from 10 different organs. For
both probe set 1 and 2 a ratio of less than 0.80 taken from at least 2 sets
of 20 interphase nuclei at 2 different areas with nonoverlapping nuclei is
consistent with allelic loss.

index: 12%. See Microscopy Description and Comment. 
COMMENT The sections contain portions of an astrocytic neoplastic proliferation that 
infiltrates and extensively effaces the cerebrum. The neoplasm is 
small-celled, and has nuclear anaplastic features, mitotic figures, 
microvascular proliferation with vascular necrosis and thrombosis, and small 
zones of tumor necrosis. The neurons contained within the neoplasm are 
interpreted as non-neoplastic native neurons, and a neuronal component is 
considered unlikely.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY: The GFAP demonstrates glial fibrillogenesis by the 
neoplastic cells. There are non-atypical neuronal elements (positive with 
synaptophysin, chromogranin, and NeuN) focally, in what appears to be cerebral 
cortex. With the MIB-1 there is a proliferation index of about 12% throughout 
the tumor. SPECIAL STAIN: There is no reticulin deposition within the neoplasm. 
The findings are consistent with a high histological grade astrocytic 
neoplasm. The neuronal cells do not appear neoplastic, and are interpreted as 
trapped native neurons.

Clinical History
•year-old man experienced a recent onset seizure and has a left facial droop. On imaging there is
a mass in
the medial and superior temporal lobe that extends into the insula, with mass effect and uncal herniation.
Operative Diagnoses
Benign brain neoplasm.
Operation / Specimen
A: Brain, right temporal lobe, excision biopsy
B: Brain, temporal lobe, excision biopsy
Pathologic Diagnosis
A and B. Brain ,right temporal ,excisional biopsies:
1.Oligodendroglioma, diffusely infiltrating.
2.MIB-1 proliferation index: 3%.
See Microscopy Description and Comment.
Comment
The sections contain portions of cerebral cortex and adjacent white matter that are diffusely and
moderately infiltrated
by a glial neoplastic proliferation made of rather uniform round nuclei, with some perineuronal satellitosis.
The MIB-1
proliferation index is somewhere between 1.5% and 3%. There is not mitotic activity, microvascular
proliferation, or
necrosis.
In this limited sample the neoplasm has a phenotype consistent with an oligodendroglial origin, and is
devoid of
anaplastic features (WHO II).

Loss of Heterozygosity 1 p, 19q Assay (LOH)
Date Ordered: Date Reported:
Surgical Pathology
Page 2 of 4
Interpretation
POSITIVE: Allelic loss on chromosome arm 19q is detected.
Allelic loss on chromosome l p is not detected.
Informative loci are: D1S548, D1 S1592, D1 S552, D19S219, D19S412, and PLA2G4C
Results -Comments
Testing was performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block (B1). H&E stained slide
was examined
and marked by a pathologist for subsequent tumor dissection. Peripheral blood DNA was used for
germline comparison,
TEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA (baseline )/Tumor DNA
pairs using 3
markers at both 1 p and 19q. The 3 markers on l p are D15548 ,D151592, and D15552 (with D15468,
D1S1612, and
D1S496 as backup markers) and the 3 markers on 19q are D19S219 ,D19S412 ,and PLA2G4C (with
D19S606 and
D19S1182 as backup ).Allmarkers are microsatellites (2 or 4 nt repeats )except PLA2G4C which is a
minisatellite (26
nt repeat )polymorphism .The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score ,amplicon size, and
ease of
interpretation .The backup markers are used if the first line markers at that chromosome arm are
uninformative or
otherwise ambiguous in their interpretation .LOH at all informative loci on each chromosomal arm
represents the
typical finding in oligodendrogliomas with 1 p and 19q deletion.

Interpretation
NEGATIVE: No evidence of methylated MGMT promoter is detected.
Results -Comments
Testing was performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block (B1). H&E stained slide
was examined
and marked by a pathologist for subsequent tumor dissection.
TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT promoter have been shown to
benefit
from therapy with alkylating agents .Assessment of MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite
treatment of
DNA followed by real-time PCR amplification of methylated and unmethylated DNA
sequences-The
analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by serial dilution of methylated positive control DNA into
unmethylated DNA, and was assessed to be 1% of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated
DNA. Factors
such as the presence of >50% non-neoplastic cells in the sample, or extensive tissue necrosis, may
preclude the
detection of methylated MGMT promoter sequences.

IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY: The GFAP demonstrates a gliofibrillary background throughout the
specimen, and
numerous reactive astrocytes. About one fourth of neoplastic nuclei over express strongly the p53
protein. With the
MIB-1 the proliferation index of the total number of cells is about 1.5%, perhaps about 3% in the
neoplasm assuming
that one half of nuclei are native non-neoplastic cells.

COMMENT 
In the three specimens there is a glial neoplastic proliferation with 
at. 
overall oligodendroglial phenotype with small proliferation centers, 
but also 
vlith a prominent astrocytic component. Mitotic figures are found with 
difficulty, and the MIB-l proliferation index is low at about 2% in 
the more 
active areas. There is no microvascular proliferation or necrosis. 
In 
specimen C there are some proliferation micro centers, some mitoses, 
and a feYl 
hyalinized vessels. 
The neoplasm is interpreted as a mixed oligoastrocytoma with low 
proliferation 
index WHO II/III. The focal proliferating activity may portend an 
aggressive 
behavior. In the specimens examined there are no cellular anaplastic 
features.  The findings in the biopsy may be correlated Nith clinical, imagingl

TEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA 
(baseline)/ Tumor DNA pairs using 3 markers at both Ip and 19q. The 3 
markers 
on Ip are D1S548, D1S1592, and D1S552 (with D1S468, D1S1612, and 
D1S496 as

PLA2G4C 
(with D19S606 and D19S1182 as backup). All markers are microsatellites 
(2 or 4 
nt repeats) except PLA2G4C which is a minisatellite (26 nt repeat) 
polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score, 
amplicon size, and ease of interpretation. The backup markers are used

INTERPRETATION AND DIAGNOSIS:
1-5) BRAIN TUMOR :ANAPLASTIC ASTROCYTOMA, WHO GRADE III, SEE COMMENT.
COMMENT :While some of the lesion is grade II, tissue in 1A has the
cellularity, nuclear atypia, and mitotic activity of a grade III
lesion .The MIB --1 rate is approximately 5%. While there are some
oligodendroglioma features ,i.e. round uniform nuclei and
perivascular haloes ,the tumor, overall .,has features of astrocytoma.
Molecular studies found changes consistent with loss of
heterozygosity on 19q ,but not on lp. As such, the lp/19q codeletion
associated with oligodendroglioma was not present. Isolated loss of
19q is not uncommon in astrocytomas.

Results-Comments IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY: The GFAP demonstrates sparse gliofibrillogenesis by the 
neoplastic cells. Only about 2% of neoplastic cells over express the p53 
protein. The NFP is non reactive. There is a MIB1 proliferation index of 
about 12% in the more active areas. \ 
\  Interpretation The immuno findings described below support the glioblastoma diagnosis. 
Results-Comments IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY: 0he neuronal markers (chromogranin and synaptophysin) 
demonstrate a neuropil background focally at the infiltrative edge of the 
tumor, and some entrapped neurons within the neoplasm. These neurons are 
interpreted as nOI,.~.neopla.stic. The CD34 ''depicts a rich capillary-type

Pathologic Diagnosis
Brain ,right temporal ,excision: Mixed oligoastrocytoma ,anaplastic (WHO grade 111).
See Microscopy Description and Comment.
Comment
The sections contain large portions of brain extensively infiltrated and effaced by a very cellular glial
neoplastic
proliferation. The neoplastic cells have a mixed oligo astrocytic phenotype, there is focally brisk mitotic
activity, and
the MIB-1 proliferation index is about 75% in the more active areas .There is also focal endothelial
hyperplasia and
some microvascular proliferation. There are focal areas of necrosis and hemorrhage with some pigment,
most likely
associated wit previous surgical procedure.
The findings are interpreted as those of an anaplastic oligoastrocytoma.

PCR for EGFR variant III mutation
Date Ordered : Date Reported:
Interpretation
Surgical Pathology
Page 2 of 4
NEGATIVE - No evidence of EGFRvIll mutation is detected
Results -Comments
TEST DESCRIPTION: Testing performed on RNA extracted from paraffin tissue block (Al)
H and E slide was examined and no microdissection was needed.
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an attractive molecular target in glioblastoma because it
is amplified,
overexpressed, and/or mutated in up to 40% to 50% of patients. Epidermal growth factor receptor variant
III
(EGFRvIII) is an oncogenic, constitutively active mutant form of EGFR that is commonly expressed in
glioblastoma. Cell culture and in vivo models of glioblastoma have demonstrated EGFRvIII as defining prognostically
distinct
subgroups of glioblastomas .Additionally ,the presence of EGFRvIII has been shown to sensitize tumors
to EGFR
tyrosine kinase inhibitors when the tumor suppressor protein PTEN is intact. RNA is extracted from
formalin fixed,
paraffin embedded tissue samples and reverse transcribed to cDNA. The cDNA is then amplified using
standard PCR
technique for DNA templates. PCR products are detected by gel electrophoresis. The limit of detection of
this assay
has been determined to be approximately 5 mutant cells in 100 normal cells.
FDA Comment :The above data are not to be construed as the results from a stand alone diagnostic test.
This test
was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the
as required
by CLIA '88 regulations. It has not been cleared or approved for specific uses by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA). The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These

Loss of Heterozygosity 1 p, 19q Assay (LOH)
Date Ordered : Date Reported:
Interpretation
NEGATIVE: Allelic loss on chromosome arm 1 p and chromosome arm 19q is NOT detected.
Informative loci are: D1S1612, D1S496, D19S219, D19S412, and PLA2G4C
Results -Comments
Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block (Al). DNA extracted from a
corresponding
blood specimen was used as a normal reference control.
H and E slide was examined and no microdissection was needed.
TEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA (baseline)/ Tumor DNA
pairs using 3
markers at both 1 p and 19q. The 3 markers on 1 p are D1 S548, D1 S1592, and D1 S552 (with D1 S468,
D1 S1612, and
D1S496 as backup markers) and the 3 markers on 19q are D19S219, D19S412, and PLA2G4C (with
D19S606 and
D19S1182 as backup). All markers are microsatellites (2 or 4 nt repeats) except PLA2G4C which is a
minisatellite (26
nt repeat) polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score, amplicon size, and
ease of
interpretation. The backup markers are used if the first line markers at that chromosome arm are
uninformative or
otherwise ambiguous in their interpretation. LOH at all informative loci on each chromosomal arm
represents the
typical finding in oligodendrogliomas with 1 p and 19q deletion.

DNA followed by real-time PCR amplification of methylated and unmethylated DNA
sequences. The
analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by serial dilution of methylated positive control DNA into
unmethylated DNA, and was assessed to be 1% of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated
DNA. Factors
such as the presence of >50% non-neoplastic cells in the sample, or extensive tissue necrosis, may
preclude the
detection of methylated MGMT promoter sequences.

Addendum Diagnosis
Review of the slides confirms the diagnosis of a high-grade mixed oligodendroglial and astrocytic glioma.
A regional
area of increased cellular atypia and cellular density associated with focal microvascular proliferation is
noted. Focal
necrosis is also present. Considering these features, the differential diagnosis includes a high-grade
oligoastrocytoma
in transition to glioblastoma with oligodendroglial component, WHO grade IV. Clinical correlation is
recommended.

IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY: The GFAP demonstrates an overall sparse gliofibrillary back ground. The
CD34
depicts a monotonous capillary-type microvascular network, with a few areas that have endothelial
hyperplasia, and a
couple of areas with few vessels with microvascular cellular proliferation. Many cells weakly over express
the p53
protein, and only a small minority strongly over expresses the protein. With the MIB-1 there is very high
proliferation
index that reaches 75% in the more active areas.

INTERPRETATION 
 
1p intact: A majority of nuclei showed similar numbers of 1p36 and 1q25 signals. There is no evidence of allelic loss on the short arm of chromosome 1 (1p).  19q intact: A majority of nuclei showed similar numbers of 19q13 and 19p13 signals. THere is no evidence of allelic loss of 19q.  Allelic loss at one locus does not necessarily predict the presence of alterations at other loci on the same chromosome, i.e. FISH may not detect partial allelic loss. FISH may not detect allelic losses if there is loss of one allele and replication on the allele.  
Comment:  
Several days after unstained slides from block A2 were received, additional unstained slides from 
block B1 were received. This was discussed with Dr. Mark Cohen on 2011. The unstained slides from 
block B1 will not be stained and will be returned.  
 Allelic loss on chromosome 1p has been shown to correlate with with chemoresponsiveness and long progression-free surival in some gliomas. This correlation is stronger when there is concomitant allelic loss on 19q. An association of chemoresponsiveness and/or long progression-free survivl with allelic loss on 19q in the absence of loss on 1p has not been established. In patients with 1p/19q loss,
 
Method:   
The integrity of the short arm of chromosome 1 (1p) and long arm of chromosome 19 (19q) was 
evaluated with interphase florescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using locus-specific probes target (1p36, 19q13) and reference probes (1q25,19p13) (Abbott Meloecular/Vysis, des Plaines, IL). The analysis was performed on areas of glial neoplasm and only atypical nuclei with two or more reference probe signals were counted. Reported quantitavtive data represents an average of 40 nuclei. Loss is defined as a ratio of less than or eugual to 0.7./ Aneusomy is defined as a mean of greater that or equal to 3.0 for the reference probe signals (1q25, 19p13).

Reviewer !nitiajsDISgt JALIFIFD I. Deep to cyst wall: White matter with cyst wall lined by moderately cellular, viable tumor.
Comment :This astrocytoma diffusely infiltrates white and gray matter. In some areas, especially the cyst
wall, the cells are as^ocjated with prominent microcystic change. Tumor cells have moderately
pleomorphic astrocytic nuclei, some naked and others with gemistocytic cytoplasm; other areas have a
more round, monotonous pattern suggestive of an oligodendroglioma component. Immunostain for p53 is
diffusely positive, however, arguing against an oligodendroglioma. Perineuronal satellitosis is seen. No
evidence of an underlying grade 1 tumor is seen (i.e. no EGBs, Rosethal fibers or noninfiltrative areas).
No mitoses are present. Though the cellularity and pleomorphism are in some areas pronounced, no
mitoses, vascular endothelial proliferation or necrosis are present. Immunostain for MIB-1 (slide C3)
shows a nuclear labeling rate of up to 6% (rates of greater than 3% are considered likely to represent
anaplastic change by Burger et al., Surgical Pathology of the Nervous System and its Coverings, 4th ed.).
Thus the tumor is WHO grade 2, but is likely to represent early anaplastic change .Molecular testing for
MGMT, 1 p 19q are in progress.

Test Performed
MGMT Methylation Assay
Specimen Type
Paraffin Block
Result
Gene Methylation DETECTED.
Methylation of the MGMT (O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyitransferase) gene was detected using methylation specific PCR technologies.
Methylation Score: 5.67
unmethylated <2.00
methylated >=2.00
Background
MGMT (0(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase) is a DNA repair enzyme that is involved in the repair of damage caused by a variety of
DNA crosslinking compounds, including alkylating agents .Increased methylation of the MGMT gene promoter region causes diminished or
silenced expression of the gene ,making cells more sensitive to DNA damage .This relationship has been shown for glioblastomas and
alkylating agents such as Temodar(R)(temozoiomide).
Approximately 40% to 45% of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tumors exhibit MGMT gene methylation .Retrospective studies have shown that
detection of MGMT promoter methylation in tumor samples is associated with an increased likelihood of a favorable response to temozolomide.
Methodology
DNA is Isolated from formalin-fixed, paraffin -embedded (FFPE )specimen .Molecular analysis of the MGMT gene is performed by methylation-
specific PCR and detected on ABI7900 .The MGMT and beta Actin copy numbers will be used to calculate the ratio of MGMT/beta-Actin x1000.
Molecular-based testing Is highly accurate ,but as in any laboratory test, rare diagnostic errors may occur.
Results of this test are for investigational Purposes Only. The performance characteristic of this assay have been determined by The
result should not be used as a diagnostic procedure without confirmation of the diagnosis by another medically established diagnostic product
or procedure.

Justification: The tissue samples received are labeled with the patient's name and terms related to brain cyst walls and deep brain tissue.

Laterality: Not provided
Justification: The report does not mention any laterality information regarding the tissue samples.

Histology: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)
Justification: The MGMT methylation assay was performed on a paraffin block of glioblastoma, which is a type of brain tumor known as GBM.

Stage: Not applicable
Justification: Staging is not typically applied to brain tumors like GBM. Instead, they are graded based on their characteristics and malignancy.

Grade: High-grade glioma (presumed)
Justification: The presence of MGMT gene methylation in the tissue sample suggests a high-grade glioma, such as GBM, which is a highly malignant brain tumor.

Behavior: Malignant
Justification: GBM is a highly aggressive and malignant type of brain cancer with poor prognosis.",,,,

Diagnosis:
Left temporal brain tumor
Anaplastic astrocytoma, grade 3
P53: focally positive
IDH1: Negative
MIB-1 LI: 13.3%
Discussion:940113,J65
Zy""""` I!e
The neoplastic cells are negative for IDH1 with a minority expressing p53. MIB-1
reactivity areas are seen within the tumor but in the most proliferative areas a labeling
index of 13.3% is calculated, consistent with a high grade astrocytoma.
Microscopic Description:
Sections demonstrate a diffusely infiltrative astrocytic neoplasm. Atypia ranges from
mild to moderate. There is mild to moderate hypercellularity. The tumor cells resemble
fibrillary astrocytes. Some areas are suggestive, but not definitive, for perinuclear halos.
A careful examination only reveals a rare mitotic figure. There is no microvascular
proliferation or necrosis.xz V .t 3

OF _ HAS BEE:N CHANG['D. 
BRAIN, RIGHT TEMPORAL LOBE, BIOPSY: SMALL CELL GLIOMA (TO BE FURTHER 
CLASSIFIED; SEE MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION): 
REVISED PATHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS: 
BRAIN, RIGHT TEMPORAL LOBE, BIOPSY: ASTROCYTOMA, ANAPLASTIC, 
DIFFUSELY INFILTRATING. 
Operation/Specimen: Brain, right temporal lobe. 
Clinical History and Pre-Op Dx: Patient with several month history of 
visual disturbances and headaches who has a CT scan lesion involving 
the right temporal lobe and extending across the midline to the left 
hemisphere. The differential diagnosis is between lymphoma and a 
glioma. 
,u>'~""~rIVE CONSULTATION: Astrocytoma, anaplastic 
GROSS PATHOLOGY: Specimen received in a container labeled with the 
patient's name and MRN. A portion of this specimen is used for the 
intraoperative consultation and for fixation in glutaraldehyde for 
eventual electron microscopy. The total amount of tissue removed 
equals 
approximately 5.0 9 and all remaining fragments are submitted in six 
tissue cassettes. 
MICROSCOPIC: Fragments of cerebral cortex and underlying white matter 
showing multiple, focal and diffuse infiltrates by small neoplastic 
cells that in general lack differentiation. In many areas the cells 
surrund individual neurons and in small sites they show some degree of 
cytoplasmic differentiation which appears similar to that of an 
astrocyte. There are mUltiple perivascular nests of neoplastic cells. 
Areas of coagUlation necrosis or atypical mitosis are not readily 
identified, however the general impression is that this pattern of 
tissue infiltrate may represent distant extension of a rather 
aggressive type of undifferentiated neoplasm. 
In summary, the impression formed at the time of the intraoperative 
consultation that this represents a small cell glioma with very 
anaplastic features is sustained by the evidence available at this  time. In an attempt to further identify the genetic derivation of 
these cells additional sections will be cut and reacted with various 
antisera as follows: GFAP, LCA, EMA, CK-6, Synaptophysin and MIB-1. 
In addition one of the samples taken for electron microscopy will be 
evaluated. 
An addendum will be issued when all of these are completed. 
COMMENT: Additional sections were cut from several blocks and reacted 
with the following antisera: LCA, EMA, CK-6, and Synaptophysin; these 
are negative in all the neoplastic cells. These results are 
interpreted as confirming the initial impression that the derivation 
of 
these cells is not from lymphocytes, neuronal elements, or epithelial 
cells. GFAP is expressed by approximately 20% of the neoplastic 
cells. 
MIB-1: This protein is expressed by diverse percentages of cells in 
various locations; however! the mean percentage of cells expressing 
this protein is estimated to be about 10%. 
Sections evaluated with the electron microscope confirm the impression 
that the cytoplasmic features as well as the nuclei of most neoplastic 
cells are compatible with those characteristic of a neoplastic 
astrocyte. 
A letter from Dr. 
in agreement with 
involuntary delay in the issuance of this final report represents a 
combination of simultaneous events including my absence from the 
department for over two weeks, and the fact that the slides were is 
mailed 
to Dr. IIIIIIIfor consultation before dictating the addendum, and his 
reply was not opportunely delivered to the pathologist on call during 
my absence . ....

Gross Description
A single specimen is received in formalin labeled with the patient's name,medical
record number and ""#1 left temporal tumor"". The specimen consists of three,
unoriented tan-white to graytissue fragments, grossly consistent with brain tissue
measuring 3.0 x 2.5 x 1.0 cm. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal no
focal lesions. Submitted entirely in cassettes 1A-1B.
Microscopic Examination
Sections show foci of increased cellularity within gray and white matter. The foci
have infiltrative borders and are composed of cells with irregularly shaped nuclei
and moderate amounts of eosinophilic cytoplasm. Frequent pleomorphic,
hyperchromatic, and occasional multinucleated cells are present.No significant
mitotic figures, necrosis or vascular proliferation with hyperplasia is identified.
immunohistochemical stains are performed with appropriately reactive positive and
negative controls and show the neoplastic cells to be positive for GFAP and
negative for synaptophysin and NeuN.

RESULTS 
 
 Chromosome 1p: Intact, aneusomic  Chromosome 19q: Intact, eusomic   
Quantitative FISH results 
 
1p36:3.3 1q25:3.2 1p36/1q25 ratio: 1.0  19q13:2.0 19q13: 2.5 19q13/19p13 ratio: 0.8  
INTERPRETATION 
  
 
1p intact: A majority of nuclei showed similar numbers of 1p36 and 1q25 signals. There is no evidence of allelic loss on the short arm of chromosome 1 (1p).  19q intact: A majority of nuclei showed similar numbers of 19q13 and 19p13 signals. There is no evidence of allelic loss of 19q.  Allelic loss at one locus does not necessarily predict the presence of alterations at other loci on the same chromosome, i.e. FISH may not detect partial allelic loss. FISH may not detect allelic losses if there is loss of one allele and replication on the allele.  
Comment:  
Allelic loss on chromosome 1p has been shown to correlate with with chemoresponsiveness and long 
progression-free survival in some gliomas. This correlation is stronger when there is concomitant 
allelic loss on 19q. An association of chemoresponsiveness and/or long progression-free survival with allelic loss on 19q in the absence of loss on 1p has not been established. In patients with 1p/19q loss,
 
Method:   
The integrity of the short arm of chromosome 1 (1p) and long arm of chromosome 19 (19q) was 
evaluated with interphase florescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using locus-specific probes target (1p36, 19q13) and reference probes (1q25,19p13) (Abbott Melecular/Vysis, des Plaines, IL). The analysis was performed on areas of glial neoplasm and only atypical nuclei with two or more reference probe signals were counted. Reported quantitative data represents an average of 40 nuclei. Loss is defined as a ratio of less than or equal to 0.7./ Aneusomy is defined as a mean of greater that or equal to 3.0 for the reference probe signals (1q25, 19p13).

MIB-l LABELING INDEX < 1.0%.
SEE MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION AND COMMENT.
----------------------------------------------------------------Operation/Specimen: Brain.
Clinical History and Pre-Op Dx:year old woman with diagnosis 6
months ago of oligodendroglioma. For extensive resection.
GROSS PATHOLOGY: -
A. ""left tumor"", received fresh, one fragment, 0.8 cm. across.
Semifirm, pinkish-gray. In total #1.
INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION: Brain, left: glioma, low grade,
consistent with oligodendroglioma.
B. ""left tumor"", one fragment, 0.7 cm. across. Soft, pinkish-gray. In
total #2.
INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION: Brain, left: glioma, low grade,
consistent with oligodendroglioma.
MICROSCOPIC: A. and B. Portions of a moderately cellular neoplastic
glial proliferation, in which the cells display uniform round nuclei.
There is moderate nuclear pleomorphism and nuclear hyperchromasia. The
background is finely fibrillary, and the vascular network consists of
capillary-type vessels. Gliofibrillary oligodendrocytes and
minigemistocytes are rarely observed. There are no mitotic figures,
and areas of necrosis or microvascular cellular proliferation are not
observed.
SPECIAL STAINS: Immunoperoxidase methods for GFAP, synaptophysin, and
MIB-1 are performed on block #2.
With the GFAP the tumor cells are not immunoreactive. No tumor cells
immunoreact with synaptophysin. With the MIB-l a labeling index of
less than 1% is determined.
COMMENT: The neoplasm is a low grade glioma with uniform round
neoplastic nuclei, absent features of anaplasia, and a low MIB-l
labeling index of less than 1%. The nuclear pleomorphism is moderate
and consistent with a Smith's grade B.

Microscopic Description:  
Sections demonstrate a moderately hypercellular glial neoplasm. There is extensive 
infiltration through both gray and white matter. In the gray matter, perineuronal satellitosis is s triking. In the unfrozen material, most of the tumor cells are seem to have 
perinuclear halos. They have round nuclei with moderate atypia. No mitotic figures are seen. There is no microvascular proliferation or necrosis.  
 
Addendum Discussion:  
The calculated MIB -1 labeling index ranges up to 5.0% in the most proliferative regions 
of tumor. A MIB-1 labeling index of 5.0% is considered borderline by some studies for grade II and grade II oligodendrogliomas. The low grade features exhibited by this oligodendroglioma are more consistent with a grade II tumor; however, in light of the borderline MIB-1 index, this neoplasm should be closely followed for anaplastic progression and/or recurrence.

 Addendum Diagnosis : Right frontal brain tumor, including inferior medial frontal lobe 
region: Oligodendroglioma with focal anaplastic progression (grade III).  
- MIB-1 labeling index: 8.2%  
 Microscopic Description : Sectio ns of the right frontal tumor demonstrate a diffusely 
moderately hypercellular neoplasm composed of mildly to moderately atypical 
oligodendrocytes. No microvascular proliferation or necrosis is seen. The tumor diffusely 
infiltrates both the gray and white matter. There is a generally consistent cellularity. However, slide 4B demonstrates nodular foci with both greater cellularity and atypia. In one of these regions 6 mitoses are seen in 10 high power fields. Overall, this pattern is consistent with early anaplastic progression of an underlying low grade oligodendroglioma. Sections of the inferior medial frontal lobe tumor also demonstrate a diffuse, moderately cellular oligodendroglioma. Here, again, there are nodular foci with greater cellularity. However, only 1 mitosis is identified in 30 high power fields in this region.

Comment
Permanent sections confirm the frozen section diagnosis and show a gemistocytic astrocytoma.
Intermingled with
nodules of medium large gemistocytes are ares of tightly packed ,higher -grade pleomorphic astrocytoma
nuclei with .
indistinct cytoplasm .Mitotic figures are easily identified .Vascular proliferation and necrosis are not seen.
The tissue fragments are relatively small, therefore a higher -grade lesion ,e.g. glioblastoma ,WHO grade
IV, cannot
be completely ruled out due to sampling phenomena .Clinical correlation is recommended.
The patient's tumor bank slide was also reviewed. Results of ancillary studies will be reported

Interpretation
NEGATIVE - No evidence of EGFRvIII mutation is detected
Results -Comments TEST DESCRIPTION :Testing performed on RNA extracted from paraffin tissue block
T(A2)
he epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an attractive molecular target in glioblastoma because it
is amplified,
overexpressed, and/or mutated in up to 40% to 50% of patients .Epidermal growth factor receptor variant
III
(EGFRvIII )is an oncogenic ,constitutively active mutant form of EGFR that is commonly expressed in
glioblastoma.
Cell culture and in vivo models of glioblastoma have demonstrated EGFRvIII as defining prognostically
distinct
subgroups of glioblastomas .Additionally ,the presence of EGFRvIII has been shown to sensitize tumors
to EGFR
tyrosine kinase inhibitors when the tumor suppressor protein PTEN is intact .RNA is extracted from
formalin fixed,
paraffin embedded tissue samples and reverse transcribed to cDNA. The cDNA is then amplified using
standard PCR
technique for DNA templates .PCR products are detected by gel electrophoresis. The limit of detection of
this assay
has been determined to be approximately 5 mutant cells in 100 normal cells.
FDA Comment :The above data are not to be construed as the results from a stand alone diagnostic test.
This test

TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT promoter have been shown to
benefit
from therapy with alkylating agents. Assessment of MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfate
treatment of
DNA followed by real-time PCR amplification of methylated and unmethylated DNA
sequences. The
analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by serial dilution of methylated positive control DNA into
unmethylated DNA, and was assessed to be 1 % of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated
DNA. Factors

such as the presence of >50% non -neoplastic cells in the sample ,or extensive tissue necrosis, may
preclude the
detection of methylated MGMT promoter sequences.

IDHI/IDH2 Mutation Detection Assay
Date Ordered : Date Reported:
Interpretation
NEGATIVE - There is no evidence of IDH1 point mutation, as indicated by the absence of any nucleotide
changes in
codon 132 of the IDHI gene compared to the electropherogram of the reference normal sample (wild
type).
Results -Comments
TEST DESCRIPTION: IDH1/2 Mutation Analysis
Test performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block (A2)
H and E slide was examined and no microdissection was needed.
Mutation of IDH1 occurs early in glioma progression with somatic mutations of the R132 residue of IDH1
identified in
majority (>70%) of grades II and III astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas, as well as in secondary GBMs
that
developed from these lower grade lesions. Mutation analysis of closely related IDH2 revealed mutations
of IDH2
residue R172, with most mutations occurring in tumors lacking IDH1 mutations. Tumors with IDH1 or
IDH2 mutations
have distinctive genetic and clinical characteristics, and patients with such tumors have a better outcome
than those
with wild type IDH genes.
Mutations in IDH1/2 are detected by DNA sequencing procedures. The limit of detection of standard
bidirectional
sequencing is approximately 20-25%. In order to increase assay sensitivity tumor enrichment must be
performed by
manual microdissection when tumor cells in the block constitute less than 50% of nucleated cells.
FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a stand alone diagnostic

0peration/Specimen: A: Brain,right frontal lesion, biopsy 
; Brain, right frontal lesion, biopsy 
PATHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS: 
Brain, right frontal, excisional biopsies: 
1. Malignant glioma, pleomorphic, superficial (WHO III). 
2. MIB-l proliferation index: 35%. 
See Microscopy Description and Comment. 
COMMENT 
The neoplasm is a malignant proliferation of spindle/epithelioid cells that 
have prominent pleomorphism, focally brisk mitotic activity, and a high MIB-l 
proliferation index of about 35% throughout. The tumor is superficial, is 
growing focally in the leptomeningeal space, and has a prominent reticulin 
network. The tumor heavily infiltrates the brain, at its margins has 
astrocytic differentiation, and contains numerous eosinophilic granular 
bodies. Xanthomatous cells are found occasionally. 
Overall, the histological features are more consistent with an anaplastic 
pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (PXA) , in spite of the paucity of GFAP 
expression, a feature that has been observed in some PXAs, particularly when 
transformed into anaplastic tumors. The possibility of this tumor being a 
gliosarcorna has been considered; however the absence of a clear sarcomatous 
pattern, microvascular cellular proliferation, and tumor necrosis does not 
support that diagnosis at this point. 
The features in the biopsy may be correlated with clinical, imaging, and 
~oerative findings for their final interpretation and patient's follow up.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION 
IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY: The GFAP demonstrates paucity of fibrillary processes 
in the bulk of the neoplasm, where there are only small islands of 
gliofibrillogenesis; focally, where the tumor is infiltrative there is also 
gliofibrillogenesis by the neoplastic cells; these areas are also positive 
with S100, synaptophysin, MAP2, and NFP. Many cells throughout the tumor are 
positive with KPI. SMA, HHF35, and CD34 depict leptomeningeal vessel, and a 
microvasculature devoid of microvascular cellular proliferation. The neoplasm

COM M ENT: This glioblastoma multiforme is composed of extremely pleomorphic, bizarre cells, which are 
often multinucleated. The cytoplasm is primarily densely eosinophilic, consistent with a gemistocytic 
phenotype. A high percentage of the cells stain strongly for GFAP. Focally, the tumor can be seen 
infiltrating adjacent cortex. Mitoses, including abnormal mitotic figures, are easily identified. Microvascular 
proliferation is seen and focal necrosis is present. These features are diagnostic for glioblastoma 
multiforme by the criteria. It is also a glioblastoma multiforme by the  criteria, and it is a grade 
4 astrocytoma by the  criteria.

Received in formalin, a portion of irregular brain that weighs 24.0 g and measures 4.5 X
3.5 X 2.0 cm. Is lined by smooth, delicate and translucent leptomeninges, under which it
ispossible to recognize two broad gyri. To cuts, there is loss of distinction between
cortex and subcortical white matter due to irregular lesion, ill-defined, localized
predominantly in the white matter, composed of brown tissue, something firm, with
multiple small cavities, sometimes blackened, giving a spongy.
Microscopy:
Histological sections stained with H & E show infiltrative glial neoplasm, moderately
cellular, affecting the cortex and white matter, and composed of a mixed population of
glial cells. Most of these have round nuclei, dispersed chromatin and occasional
perinuclear halos and is located in the middle of areas with loose fibrillar matrix, forming
microcysts. Occasionally, we can observe some cells with eosinophilic and dense
cytoplasm, with eccentric nuclei (""minigemistocysts""). Another type of cell is
characterized by possessing more elongated nuclei with irregular outlines and dense
chromatin arranged in a dense fibrillar matrix. It is not observed mitotic figures,
microvascular proliferation or necrosis areas. It was performed immunohistochemistry
that revealed strong positivity in neoplasia for anti-GFAP and focal positivity for S100
protein .A semi -quantitative assessment of proliferation index with MIB -1antibody was
positive in less than 1 % of neoplastic nuclei.
Diagnosis:
Excision product of lesion on left frontal lobe: - Oligoastrocitoma, grade II - WHO
classification 2007.

predominantly gemistocytic. 
ADDENDUM REPORT: 
IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY: Immunoperoxidase methods for GFAP, CD34, p53 and 
MIB-l were performed on sections from block 4. There is 
gliofibrillogenesis by the neoplastic cells. Only about 3% of the 
neoplastic cells over express the p53 protein. With the MIB-l, a 
proliferation index of about 20% is determinted in the more active 
areas. The diagnosis remains as above.

IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY: The GFAP depicts sparse gliofibrilogenesis by the 
neoplastic cells. The synaptophysin and NFP demonstrate a tenuous positive 
background, indicating the infiltrative character of the neoplasm. The Neu N 
demonstrates few small neurons entrapped by the neoplasm. More than 50% of 
the neoplastic cells over express the p53 protein, and about 28% of the cells 
are in the mitotic as 'cted by the MIB-l.

serially sectioned and submitted in toto in cassettes 13A"" and

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: Sections show an abnormal population of pleomorphic, poorly differentiated cells arranged in broad sheets and fascicles within the brain parenchyma. The malignant cells are characterized by 
pleomorphic, anaplastic nuclei with dense, hyperchromatic chromatin 
and occasionally discernable nucleoli and variable amounts of eosinophilic, often spindled, cytoplasm. Many bizarre forms are present which appear as giant, multinucleated cells. In cytologic preparations, scattered cells show poorly-formed cells processes. 
Numerous abnormal mitotic figures are present. Although broad areas of necrosis are seen, significant endothelial changes are not identified. Many malignant cells display eosinophilic proteinaceous cyto~lasmic globules. Brown pigment deposition is also present. Spec~al stains are performed which show the following: 
Pruss ian blue iron stain 
Fontana-Masson melanin stain 
GFAP

MALIGNANT NEOPLASM.

COMMENT: 
Most areas of this malignant tumor show no evidence of differentiation in immunoperoxidase stains. Melanocytic differentiation is seen in one of three melanoma stains (HMB-45). 
Rare focal positive staining is also seen for GFAP,neurofilament 
and desmin. These findings, taken together with the somewhat glial appearance of this tumor, suggest that this may be a primitive neuroectodermal tumor or glioblastoma with divergent differentiation. A malignant melanoma, either primary or metastatic, can not be ruled out.

2. MIS-1 proliferation index :\R\ 4%.
See Comment.
COMMENT
In both specimens ,a moderately cellular glial neoplasm diffusely infiltrates
the cerebral cortex and white matter. The neoplastic cells are naked, mostly
round,but also elongated (mainly in the white matter ),with slight
pleomorphism .Focally ,there are hypercellular areas (""proliferation
centers""), perinuclear halos ,and one zone of microcystic change. Mitotic
figures are found with difficulty ,and the MIB-1 proliferation index is at
about 4% in the more active areas .There is no microvascular cellular
proliferation or necrosis.
The neoplasm is a mixed oligoastrocytoma ,predominantly oligodendrocytic.
There are no overt features of anaplasia (microvascular proliferation or
necrosis ).There are ,however ,proliferation centers and a few mitoses that
probably portend an aggressive behavior ,i. e. an ""intermediate"" mixed glioma,

Sections demonstrate a variably cellular glioma that diffusely infiltrates both the gray and white matter.
The majority of the tumor cells demonstrate prominent perinuclear halos. ""They consistently have round
to oval nuclei. Atypia is moderate. Cellularity is accentuated in a multinodular pattern. Neither
microvascular proliferation nor necrosis are identified .A few scattered mitotic figures are seen, but
these are insufficient by themselves to warrant classification as anaplastic.
Scattered MIB-1 reactive cells are present throughout the tumor. However ,even in the most
proliferative regions ,a labeling index of only 2.2% is calculated .Combined with the other histologic
features ,this does not warrant classification as anaplastic /grade Ill. Nevertheless, the cluster of
hypercellularity and degree of atypia is somewhat worrisome and close follow up is indicated.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION 
IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY: The GFAP demonstrates a gliofibrillary 
background with 
abundant gemistocytes. More than 45% of the tumor cells over express 
the p53

COMMENT 
The specimens are fragments of cerebrum that are infiltrated and extensively 
effaced by a glial neoplastic proliferation that has proclivity for the white 
matter. The neoplastic cells are small, elongated naked nuclei. There is 
brisk mitotic activity with a very high proliferation index of about 60%. 
There is prominent microvascular cellular proliferation and zones of tumor 
necrosis, some with pseudopalisading. Within the tumor and adjacent brain tissue there is recent hemorrhage. 
The morphology and immunophenotype are characteristic of a glioblastoma that 
has undergone recent bleeding.

~OSITIVE -EGFRvIII mutation is detected 
Results-Comments 
TEST DESCRIPTION: Testing performed on RNA extracted from tumor paraffin block 
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an attractive molecular target 
in glioblastoma because it is amplified, overexpressed, and/or mutated in up 
to 40% to 50% of patients. Epidermal growth factor receptor variant III 
(EGFRvIII) is an oncogenic, constitutively active mutant form of EGFR that is 
commonly expressed in glioblastoma. Cell culture and in vivo models of 
glioblastoma have demonstrated EGFRvIII as defining prognostically distinct 
subgroups of glioblastomas. Additionally, the presence of EGFRvIII has been 
shown to sensitize tumors to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors when the tumor 
suppressor protein PTEN is intact. RNA is extracted from formalin fixed, 
paraffin embedded tissue samples and reverse transcribed to cDNA. The cDNA is 
then amplified using standard PCR technique for DNA templates. PCR products 
are detected by gel electrophoresis. The limit of detection of this assay has 
been determined to be approximately 5 mutant cells in 100 normal cells.

 Microscopic  Discussion:  
 Sections demonstrate a mildly to moderat ely hypercellular diffuse glioma 
involving both the gray and white matter.  In contrast to the usual diffuse glial tumor, gray ma tter involvement predominates. Tumor  cells have enlarged round 
to oval nuclei and most have perinuclear halos.  Atypia is mild to moderate.  The gray matter shows secondary structures including striking perineuronal satellitosis as well as subpial condensation and foca perivascular accumulat ion.  
No mitotic figures are identified.   
 Addendum Discussion : 
 Scattered MIB -1 reactive cells are present throughout the specimen.  Because of 
the unusual growth pattern with numerous admixed neurons, a precise labeling 
index cannot be determined.  However, it appears that greater than 5% of the 
tumor nuclei are positive.  Whereas this does not by itself warrant classification of anaplastic grade 3, it is worrisome and does merit close follow -up.

Comment: 
The proliferation index of this tumor is minimally increased compared 
to that expected for the upper limit of a grade II astrocytoma. 
Typically such tumors have a proliferation index between 0 and 3%. The 
presence of a single mitosis is insufficient to grade this tumor as an 
anaplastic astrocytoma (grade III of IV). Nevertheless , the somewhat 
slightly increased proliferation index should prompt close clinical 
follow-up. 
This diagnostic report has been personally interpreted by the signatory

The tumor consists of a mildly pleomorphic and infiltrative 
proliferation of astrocytic cells. There is no endothelial 
proliferation and no necrosis. Very rare mitoses (1 definite) are

Comment
Permanent sections confirm the frozen section diagnosis. Sections of A. and B. show a mostly astrocytic
appearing
glial neoplasm. C. and D. are larger specimens and display mostly oligodendroglial features with mostly
round nuclear
morphology, ropy myelin, delicate vessels and microcyst formation. Rare mitotic figures are noted in
specimen D.
Microvascular proliferation and/or necrosis is not identified. The Ki-67 labeling index is up to
approximately 5%. The
IDH1 R132H mutation antibody is negative. Controls show appropriate immunoreactivity.
The very focal mitotic activity seen in specimen D. may reflect that the lesion could be in transition to a
higher grade.
Clinical correlation is recommended.

Findings suggestive of partial deletion of chromosome arm 19q on locus D19S606
(D19S412, D19S1182 - no evidence of loss of heterozygosity).
NEGATIVE: Allelic loss on chromosome arm 1 p is NOT detected.
Informative loci are: D1 S548, D1 S592, D1 S552, D1 S1612, D19S412, D19S606, and D19S1182
Results -Comments
Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block DNA extracted from a
corresponding blood specimen was used as a normal reference control.
H and E slide was examined and tumor DNA was enriched by microdissection
TEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA (baseline)/ Tumor DNA
pairs using 3
markers at both 1 p and 19q. The 3 markers on 1 p are D1 S548, D1 S1592, and D1 S552 (with D1 S468,
D1 S1612, and
D1 S496 as backup markers) and the 3 markers on 19q are D19S219, D19S412, and PLA2G4C (with
D19S606 and
D19S1182 as backup). All markers are microsatellites (2 or 4 nt repeats) except PLA2G4C which is a
minisatellite (26
nt repeat) polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score, amplicon size, and
ease of
interpretation. The backup markers are used if the first line markers at that chromosome arm are
uninformative or
otherwise ambiguous in their interpretation. LOH at all informative loci on each chromosomal arm
represents the
typical finding in oligodendrogliomas with 1 p and 19q deletion.

1. Permanent section of the frozen section specimen demonstrates only poorly cellular dense fibrous connective tissue. No neoplasm identified  
2, 10, 13.  Permanent section of the frozen section specimen demonstrates a mildly hypercellular glial neoplasm that diffusely  infiltrates the parenchyma which is predominantly  
white matter.  There is edema as well.  Atypia is mild to moderate.  No mitotic figures are seen.  There is no microvascular proliferation or necrosis.  No mitotic figures are identified.  
3,7. Permanent section of the frozen section specimen and unfrozen material again demonstrate a modestly hypercellular glial neoplasm that is more diffusely infiltrative than cellular.  The features are otherwise as described in specimen 2.  No mitotic figures are identified.  
4, 8  Permanent section of the frozen section specimen and unfrozen material demonstrate  a 
mildly hypercellular, apparently low grade glioma that diffusely infiltrates the gray and white matter.  The features are as previously described, but this specimen is more cellular than 
either specimen 2 or 3.  No mitotic figures are identified.  
5, 9.  permanent section of the frozen section specimen and unfrozen material confirm the presence of a cellular and infiltrating apparently low grade glioma.  In addition, a nodular area with numerous  foci of dystrophic calcifications are seen.  No mitotic figures are 
identified.  
6.  Sections demonstrate variably thickened and poorly cellular dense irregular fibrous connective tissue.  The tissue demonstrates multifocal reactive changes including edema, macrophage infiltrates, chronic inflammation and microcalcificatins.  Focally, the fibrous tissue is adherent to gliotic brain parenchyma which also demonstrates old hemorrhage.  N o 
neoplasm is seen.  No mitotic figures are identified.  
11.  Permanent section of the frozen section specimen demonstrates a modestly hypercellular glial neoplasm that diffusely infiltrates the white matter.  Although qualifying as cellular tumor, this specimen as cellular tumor, this specimen is less cellular than any of the previous specimens.  
12.  Permanent section of the frozen section specimen demonstrates a modestly hypercellular glial neoplasm that diffusely infiltrates gray and white matter.  A larg e band of 
dystrophic calcification is also seen.  The specimen is less cellular than most of the previous biopsies, but more than specimen 11.  
 Addendum discussion : 
MIB-1 reactivity varies greatly within the tumor.  In the less cellular areas only a few MI B-1 
reactive cells are present with a labeling index of <1% to about 3%.  However, in some of the moderately cellular areas there are patchy areas of high MIB -1 reactivity.  In these areas the 
labeling of 12.5% s calculated. Based on the overall findings, the MIB -1 labeling suggest 
anaplastic progression in the background of a low grade glioma.

COMMENT 
Parts A and B are portions of cerebrum diffusely and heavily infiltrated by a 
glial neoplastic proliferation. The neoplastic cells are naked pleomorphic 
nuclei that have nuclear anaplasia, frequent mitoses, and a very high 
proliferation index of about 65%. There is foCally prominent microvascular 
cellular proliferation and necrosis, and areas of tumor necrosis. Focally, 
also, there is suggestion of an oligodendroglial component. 
The morphological features are those of a glioblastoma multiforrne, with 
perhaps an oligodendroglial component.

Results-Comments 
TEST DF.~r~TPTTn~. To~r~_ng performed on RNA extracted from paraffin tissue 
block' 
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an attractive molecular target 
in glioblastoma because it is amplified, overexpressed, and/or mutated in up 
to 40% to 50% of patients. Epidermal growth factor receptor variant III 
(EGFRvIII) is an oncogenic, constitutively active mutant form of EGFR that is 
commonly expressed in glioblastoma. Cell culture and in vivo models of 
glioblastoma have demonstrated EGFRvIII as defining prognostically distinct 
subgroups'of glioblastomas. Additionally, the presence of EGFRvIII has been 
shown to sensitize tumors to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors when the tumor 
suppressor protein PTEN is intact. RNA is extracted from formalin fixed, 
paraffin embedded tissue samples and reverse transcribed to cDNA. The cDNA is 
then amplified using standard PCR technique for DNA templates. PCR products 
are detected by gel electrophoresis. The limit of detection of this assay has 
been determined to be approximately 5 mutant cells in 100 normal cells.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION 
IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY: The neoplasm has a heavy GFAP-positive 
gliofibrillary background. Over 95% of the neoplastic cells strongly over 
express the p53'protein. With the MIB-l about 65% of the cells throughout the 
tumor are cycling. The CD163 depicts perivascular microglia only in the areas 
of vlell preserved tumor tissue, and abundant phagocytic cells in the areas of 
tumor necrosis. The CD34 highlights the microvasculature with frequent 
microvascular cellular proliferation. The neuronal markers synaptophysin and 
NeuN demonstrate the diffusely infiltrative character of the neoplasm.

Cerebral cortex segment weighing 36 grams and measuring 5.2 x 4 .5 x 3.5 cm. One of
itssides is coated by lightly congested menige .The other side shows up bloody,
brownish ,with hemorrhagic areas.
Microscopy:
The histological sections showed neuroepithelial and multinodular malignant neoplasm,
composed of rounded and monomorphic nuclei cells ,with granular chromatin and with
mild hyperchromasia .The cytoplasm is scanty, observing ,sometimes ,clear perinuclear
halos .We also observed some large and eosinophilic cytoplasm cells with
minigemistocistic pattern (GFOC). The tumor is infiltrating ,undermining the white matter
and adjacent neocortex ,which are seen outbreaks of neuronal sattelitosis .Are seen
some secondary Scherer structures and extent of the neoplasm to the adjacent
subarachnoid and the Virchow Robin spaces. Are also seen foci of necrosis and
dystrophic calcification .The mitotic figures are easily found .Calls attention the
presence of dystrophic calcification in the media of some arteries of medium caliber.
Diagnosis:
Biopsy product of the left temporal lesion: anaplastic oligodendroglioma, WHO grade II
(9451/3).
Award of 1 p/1 9q deletion analysis:
The hybridizations were performed on 5 micrometers thick sections of formalin-fixed
and paraffin-embedded neoplastic tissue (FFPE) in the most representative tumor area
with 1p36/1q25 and 19q13/19p13 probe. 100 to 200 were evaluated in each

Addendum Discussion:
The neoplastic cells are diffuselyimmunoreactive for p53, suggesting a astrocytic origin.
Numerous MIB-1 reactive cells are present with a labeling index estimated at 20%.
Although a minor population suggesting oligodendroglioma differentiation was seen, this strong
diffused p53 positivity argues against this and suggests that the apparent gerinuclear halos were
simply cells with poor differentiation in a few processes.
Addendum Diagnosis:
Anaplastic Astrocytoma (WHO grade III)
Microscopic Description:
1, 2 sections demonstrate a markedly hypercellular glial neoplasm that diffusely infiltrates both
gray and white matter .The majority of the tumor cells have an oligodendroglioma phenotype with
perinuclear halos and fine branching vasculature. However ,a significant minority of an
astrocytoma phenotype is also seen. Atypica is moderate to focally marked. Numerous mitotic
figures are seen .Neither microvascular proliferation nor necrosis are present.
3. Sections demonstrate a similar diffuse glial neoplasm .However ,here most areas show a less
cellular and infiltrating tumor.

 female presents today for craniotomy 
for resection of left tempora rain tumor. History of headaches, left 
eye blurriness. MRI showed abnormality in left temporal area. 
GROSS DESCRIPTION: Received the following specimens in the Department of 
Pathology, labeled with the patient's name and hospital #: . 
A .. Tumor 
B. Tumor #2 
The specimen is received fresh and consists of a 6.5 x 4.0 x 1.5 ern 
rectangular piece·of cerebral cortex and underlying subcortical white 
matter. The deep surfaces are cauterized and focally hemorrhagic. The 
meningeal surface has a prominent surface vasculature with the usual 
gyral and focused pattern. Sectioning reveals the majority of the 
specimen to have a clear demarcation between apparent cortex and adjacent 
white matter layers, however, along one deep edge the gray matter is 
obscured by an ill-defined firm white lesion measuring 2.2 x 1.5 x 1.0 em 
in greatest dimension. A representative section of the lesion is 
submitted for frozen section. Frozen section diagnosis is, ""Infiltrating 
glioma with focal ~ areas; final diagnosis deferred to permanent 
sections,l1 per _ The frozen tissue is submitted for permanent 
processing in cassette FSA1. Additional representative sections of the 
lesion are submitted in cassettes A2-A6. A representative section of 
uninvolved cortex is submitted in cassette A7. 
The specimen is· received without fixative and consists of a 2.5 x 1.8 x 
0.4 cm rectangular piece of cortical brain tissue. Sectioning reveals 
the demarcation between the gray and adjacent white matter layers to be 
smudged and ill-defined. No discrete lesion is grossly identified. A 
representative portion of the tissue is submitted for frozen section. 
Frozen section diagnosis is, ""Infiltrating glioma/II per  . The 
frozen tissue is submitted for permanent processing in cassette. FSB1. 
The remaining tissue is entirely submitted in cassettes B2-B4.  
DIAGNOSIS: 
A. II Tumor It : 
Anaplastic mixed ~lioma (oligoastrocytoma) (WHO Grade 
III) (see comment) 
B. ""Tumor #2"": 
Anaplastic mixed glioma (oligoastrocytoma) (see 
comment) 
COMMENT: This infiltrating glioma extensively infiltrates gray and white 
matter. The predominant pattern is that of a diffuse anaplastic 
astrocytoma with moderate nuclear and cellular pleomorphism and 
significant mitotic activity·(S mitoses per ten high power fields in some 
 areas). However/ areas· having a ve~y uniform and distinctly 
oligodendrogliomatous histologic appearance are also present, although 
these are in the minority. The Ki67 labeling index is about 10-15% 
overall. These findings support the diagnosis. The tumor is negative 
for' PTEN and EGFRvIII. The pattern of GFAP immunoreactivity suggests 
positive staining of both neoplastic and reactive elements. 
The status of chromosomes 1p and 19q will be determined by 
fluorescence in situ hybridization and reported as an addendum to this 
report. ""I/· or my qualified designee I have per~ormed the gross examination

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:
Microscopic examination shows brain infiltrated by a glial neoplasm
characterized by cellular pleomorphism ,and microvascular changes. A ki-67
immunostain yields a proliferation rate of 10% .No necrosis is seen.
Tumor is noted to be growing in Virchow-Robin spaces along blood vessels, as
well as in the subarachnoid region. Occasional satellitosis is noted,
suggestive of an oligodendrocytic component, however the majority of the
histology is more compatible with a diagnosis of astrocytoma. Additionally, a
GFAP immunostain decorates large reactive astrocytes.
IMMUNOHISTBCHEMICAL FINDINGS:
xi-67 immunostaining reveals a proliferation rate of 10%. GFAP highlights
large reactive astrocytes. HAM-56 fails to detect significant macrophages.

PATHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS: 
A. and B. Brain, left frontal tumor, excision: Glioblastoma (WHO Grade IV) 
(see comment). 
COMMENT Sections show a densely cellular tumor demonstrating vascular proliferation 
and necrosis. The tumor cells are diffusely positive for GFAP and p53. The 
Ki-67 labeling index is variable, but is focally up to 60% in several areas. 
Results of MGMT promoter methylation and EGFRvIII mutation assays will be 
reported below in procedure addenda. 
PROCEDURES/ADDENDA 
PCR for EGFR 
Date Ordered: 
Interpretation Date Reported: 
POSITIVE -EGFRvIII mutation is detected 
Results-Comments  TEST DESCRIPTION: Testing performed on RNA extracted from tumor paraffin 
block 
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an attractive molecular 
target 
in glioblastoma because it is amplified, overexpressed, and/or mutated in up 
to 40% to 50% of patients. Epidermal growth factor receptor variant III 
(EGFRvIII) is an oncogenic, constitutively active mutant form of EGFR that 
is 
commonly expressed in glioblastoma. Cell culture and in vivo models of 
glioblastoma have demonstrated EGFRvIII as defining prognostically distinct 
subgroups of glioblastomas. Additionally, the presence of EGFRvIII has been 
shown to sensitize tUmors to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors when the tumor 
suppressor protein PTEN is intact. RNA is extracted from formalin fixed{ 
paraffin embedded tissue samples and reverse transcribed to cDNA. The cDNA 
is 
then amplified using standard peR technique for DNA templates. peR products 
are detected by gel electrophoresis. The limit of detection of this assay 
has 
been determined to be approximately 5 mutant cells in 100 normal cells. 
FDA Comment: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a 
stand alone diagnostic test. This its performance

required by eLlA ' • regulations. or approved for

determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These results 
are 
provided for informational purposes only, and should be interpreted only in 
the context of established procedures and/or diagnostic criteria. 
Interpretation 
NEGATIVE: No evidence of methylated MGMT promoter is detected. 
Results-Comments 
Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block. 
TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT promoter 
have been shown to benefit from therapy with alkylating agents. Assessment 
of 
MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite treatment of DNA 
follov16d 
by real-time peR amplification (MethyLight) of methylated and unmethylated 
DNA 
sequences.  The analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by serial dilution of 
methylated positive control DNA into unmethylated DNA, and was assessed to 
be 
1% of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated DNA. Factors such as 
the presence of >50% non-neoplastic cells in the sample, or extensive tissue 
necrosis, may preclude the detection of methylated MGMT promoter sequences.

COMMENT 
Sections show a mitotically active tumor composed of strongly GFAP and 
S100 
positive areas with cells resembling neoplastic astrocytes and other 
more 
epithelioid cells resembling meningioma. Microvascular proliferation 
is 
present hOl-lever I is not a dominant feature of the tumor vasculature. A 
distinct area shows more spindle shaped cells which are mostly GFAP 
and S100 
negative and CD34 and reticulin positive. Vimentin is diffusely 
positive. EMA 
shows scattered weak positivity. Pan-keratin is negative. The Ki-67 
labeling 
index is up to approximately 30%. Positive and negative controls show 
appropriate immunoreactivity. 
This is an unusual tumor. Considering the present histological 
findings and 
clinical findings revie\-ved at our recent 
the lesion 
appears to be more consistent with gliosarcoma. A recent study found 
that  gliosarcomas resembling meningiomas (surgically and macroscopically) 
may be 
associated with prolonged patient survival compared to classical

NOTE: Tumor cells are predominantly small, with intermingled mini-gemistocytic type cells, with
round to oval bland nuclei and perinuclear halos. Although there is no microvascular
proliferation or necrosis, some areas show increased mitotic activity up to 6-7 mitoses per high-
power field, consistent with anaplastic oligodendroglioma. Tumor cells are strongly positive for
IDH1 and only rare nuclei are positive for p53 (block B4). Overall Ki-67 labeling index is less

demonstrate a glial, infiltrative tumor of mar^ed hypercellularity.The nuclei
contain moderate pleomorphism and hyperchromasia and scatteredmitoses are seen.
Many of the nuclei display round profiles, but many others are angular in contour.
There is no microvascular proliferation or necrosis identified in the neoplasm.
immunohistochemistry for glial fibrillary acidic protein is diffusely positive in
the tumor.MIB-1 is positive in approximately 20% of nuclei. IDH-i is diffusely
positive in the tumor, therefore, the tumor is likely to be mutated for IDH-1.
Both p53 and PTEN ixnmunostains are diffusely positive. All controls are
appropriate.

MGMT METHYLATION ASSAY : GENE METHYLATION DETECTED.

MGMT Methylation Assay:
Result: Gene Methylation DETECTED.
Methylation Score: 9.46
--REFERENCE VALUE--
unmethylated <2.00
methylated >=2.00
Background:
MGMT (0(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase] is a DNA repair enzyme that is
involved in the repair of damage caused by a variety of DNA crosslinking compounds,
including alkylating agents. Increased methylation of the MGMT gene promotor
region causes diminished or silenced expression of the gene, making cells•more
sensitive to DNA damage. This relationship has been shown for glioblastomas and
alkylating agents such as temozolomide. Approximately 40-50% of glioblastomas
exhibit MGMT gene methylation. Retrospective studies have shown that detection of
MGMT promotor methylation in tumor samples is associated with an increased
likelihood of a favorable response to temozolomide.
Methodology':
DNA is isolated from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens.
Molecular analysis of the MGMT gene is performed by methylation-specific PCR and
detected on AB17900. The MGMT and beta-Actin copy numbers are used to calculate
the ratio of MGMT/beta-Actin x1000. Molecular-based testing is highly accurate,
but as in any laboratory test, rare diagnostic errors may occur. Results of this
test are for Investigational Purposes Only. The performance characteristics of
this assay have been determined by .The result should not be used as a
diagnostic procedure without confirmation of the diagnosis by another medically
established diagnostic product or procedure.

RESULTS
Ratio of 0.89 Cell count of lp/lq: 142
Ratio of 0.70 Cell count of 19q/19p: 131
Interpretation of Results: A) lp no loss ;B)19q loss
Interpretation of findings:
A) (negative) The majority of tumors cells displayed 2 to 3 control
chromosome 1q25 signals and 2 to 3 chromosome 1p36 signals
(locus of interest), and the ratio of 1p36/1q25 Ratio was >0.8. The
results are consistent with no loss of the 1p36 locus of interest.
B) (positive) The majority of tumors cells displayed 2 control
chromosome 19p13 signals and 1 chromosome 19q13 signals (locus of
interest). The ratio of 19q13/19p13 is <0.8 .The results are
consistent with the loss of 1p36 locus of interest.

Comments
The resultant FISH section /slide is scanned by a trained licensed
medicaltechnologist and analyzed using a FDA -approved ,validated
semi-automated scanning imaging workstation and accompanying imaging
analysis software ' The resultant FISH section /slide is then
presented to the interpreting Pathologist, who will reviews the FISH
results from and compares them to the results manually observed
under an Olympus Fluorescence Microscope .Therefore the ratio is enumerated
by computer -aided counting as well as manual counting.
Interpretation of Test
The ratio for probe set 1 is derived by dividing the total number of
LSI 1p36 signals by the total number of LSI 1q25 signals in at least 20
interphase nuclei with
nonover-lapping--nut-le-i-irr the n^oglastic gl#a^^erls: ^e Y^wi Yr n^ stgrxals -
or with signals of only one color are disregarded. The ratio for probe set
2 is derived by dividing the total number of LSI 19813 signals by the total Page 3
number of LSI 19p13 signals in at least 2 sets of 20 interphase nuclei with
nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic glial cells at two different areas
of the sample. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are
disregarded. References ranges for our laboratory for allelic loss versus
no allelic loss were established by evaluating both probe sets in a series
of 40 normal cases from 10 different organs .For both probe set 1 and 2 a
ratio of less than 0.80 taken from at least 2 sets of 20 interphase nuclei
at 2 different areas with nonoverlapping nuclei is consistent with allelic
loss. FISH and H&&E stained slides have been reviewed by the
interpreting pathologist.

ddendum Discussion: 
The calculated MIB -1 Labeling Index overall appears low with focal regions increased at 
4.9%. Overall, the histologic features of this tumor are consistent with a low grade 
oligodendroglioma; however, the MIB- 1 Labe ling index is borderline for a low grade 
oligodendroglioma (<5%; WHO,  Close followup for recurrence and/or anaplastic progression may be warranted.   
Brain Tumor, Biopsy and Resection: 
 
Oligodendroglioma (Who grade II) 
MIB -1 Labeling Index = 4.9%  
  
Microscopic Description:  
 
1,2 Sections of gray and white matter demonstrate a diffusely infiltrating glioma. The tumor is mildly to moderately hypercellular. It is composed of cells with round to somewhat irregular nuclei and scant processes. Most have per nicuclear halos. Only a rare 
mitotic figure is seen. No microvascular proliferation or necrosis is present.

Comment
Permanent sections confirm the frozen section diagnosis. Sections show a glioma with mostly
oligodendroglial
features. Some most angulated cells are also noted suggesting a lesser astrocytic component. Mitotic
activity is noted
in specimen B. Vascular proliferation and/or necrosis is not seen .The Ki-67 labeling index is up to
approximately 8%.
Controls show appropriate reactivity.
Although the lesion meets criteria for a grade II oligodendroglioma, the focal mitotic activity may suggest
that it is in
transition to a grade III lesion. Clinical correlation is recommended.
Controls show appropriate reactivity.

MGMT Promoter Methylation

Interpretation
POSITIVE: Methylated MGMT promoter is detected.
Surgical Pathology
Page 2 of 4
Results -Comments
Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block
H and E slide was examined and no microdissection was needed.
TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT promoter have been shown to
benefit
from therapy with alkylating agents. Assessment of MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite
treatment of
DNA followed by real-time PCR amplification of methylated and unmethylated DNA
sequences. The
analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by serial dilution of methylated positive control DNA into unmethylated DNA, and was assessed to be 1% of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated
DNA. Factors
such as the presence of >50% non-neoplastic cells in the sample ,or extensive tissue necrosis, may
preclude the
detection of methylated MGMT promoter sequences.
FDA COMMENT :The above data are not to be construed as the results from a stand alone diagnostic
test. This test
was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the
as required
by CLIA '88 regulations. It has not been cleared or approved for specific uses by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA). The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These
results are
provided for informational purposes only, and should be interpreted only in the context of established
procedures

Loss of Heterozygosity 1p, 19q Assay (LOH)
Date Ordered: Date Reported:
Interpretation
NEGATIVE: Allelic loss on chromosome arm 1 p and chromosome arm 19q is NOT detected.
Informative loci are: D1 S1592, D1 S552, D1 S1612, D19S219, D19S412 and PLA2G4C
Results-Comments
Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block DNA extracted from a
corresponding blood specimen was used as a normal reference control.
H and E slide was examined and no microdissection was needed.
TEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA (baseline)/ Tumor DNA
pairs using 3
markers at both 1 p and 19q. The 3 markers on 1 p are D1 S548, D1 S1592, and D1 S552 (with D1 S468,
Dl 51612, and
D1 S496 as backup markers) and the 3 markers on 19q are D19S219, DI 95412, and PLA2G4C (with
D19S606 and
DI 9S1 182 as backup). All markers are microsatellites (2 or 4 nt repeats) except PLA2G4C which is a
minisatellite (26
nt repeat) polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score, amplicon size, and
ease of
interpretation. The backup markers are used if the first line markers at that chromosome arm are
uninformative or
otherwise ambiguous in their interpretation. LOH at all informative loci on each chromosomal arm
represents the
typical finding in oligodendrogliomas with I p and 1 9q deletion.

CLINICAL HISTORY:
Not provided. MRI: A large region of masslike heterogeneous T2 hyperintensity
centered within the right frontal lobe, extending into the genu and anterior
body of the corpus callosum. The region of T2 hyperintensity measures
approximately 9.3 x 7.3 cm, greatest orthogonal axial dimensions, not
significantly changed from prior. Multiple small central Ti hypointense foci,
without signal on FLAIR images, likely represent small areas of cystic
change/necrosis. No significant enhancement is present in this region. No
distant foci of abnormal parenchymal signal are present. Mass effect continues
to result inapproximately 1.2 cm of right-to-left midline shift, unchanged. No
abnormal extra-axial fluid collections. Basal cisterns are patent. The right
frontal horn is completely effaced, with partial effacement of the right
lateral ventricle body.

Result:
MGMT PROMOTER METHYLATION IDENTIFIED (METHYLATION INDEX = 13.28; SEE NOTE).
Note:
The specimen is considered negative for MGMT promoter methylation when
Methylation Index (MI) is less than 4. MI between 4 and 16 is considered as
low level methylation and should be interpreted with caution since the
significance of low level methylation in gliomas is not well understood. MI
greater than 16 is considered as methylated.
Background:
MGMT (O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase) is a DNA repair enzyme
that is involved in the repair of damage caused by a variety of DNA
crosslinking compounds, including alkylating agents. Increased
methylation of the MGMT gene promoter region causes diminished or
silenced expression of the gene, making cells more sensitive to DNA
damage. This relationship has been shown for glioblastomas and
alkylating agents such as Temodar(R)(temozolomide).
Approximately 40% to 45% of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tumors
exbi hi t MGMT gene methyl ati on - ^c hnrrn } t
detection of MGMT promoter methylation in tumor samples is associated
with an increased likelihood of a favorable response to temozolomide.
Methodology:
DNA is isolated from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
specimen. Molecular analysis of the MGMT gene is performed by
methylation-specific PCR. Molecular-based testing is highly accurate but
as in any laboratory test, rare diagnostic errors may occur.
Results of this test are for Investigational Purposes Only. The
performance characteristic of this assay have been determined by
The result should not be used as a diagnostic procedure
without confirmation of the diagnosis by another medically
established diagnostic product or procedure.

GENERAL: A 5.5 x 4 x 1.5 cm. aggregate of gray-tan soft brain
tissue admixed with sanguinous clot. No discrete
nodules are identified.
SECTION: 1-5 - submitted in toto.
COMMENT: The bulk of the specimen is brain parenchyma with
rarefaction, prominent glial reactive changes, extensive areas of
coagulation necrosis, and widespread vasculopathy.In addition, there
are a couple of small zones in which cellularity and nuclear atypia are
prominent and suggestive of neoplasm. However, a reactive change with
post-radiation atypia may not be completely excluded.
SPECIAL STAIN REPORT: Immunoperoxidase methods for GFAP and MIB-1 were
performed on sections from blocks 3 and 4.
The GFAP demonstrates that the great majority of astrocytes, although
atypical, have a reactive phenotype. There is mitotic activity that by
its distribution is most likely in lymphocytic/phagocytic cells.
Although isolated tumor cells cannot be ruled out, the process overall
does not appear neoplastic.

Results-Comments 
Test performed on tumor paraffin block  and peripheral blood for

TEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA 
(baseline)/ Tumor DNA pairs using 3 markers at both 1p and 19q. The 3 markers 
on 1p are D1S548, D1S1592, and D1S552 (with 018468, D1S1612, and D1S496 as 
backup markers) and the 3 markers on 19q are D19S219, D19S412, and PLA2G4C 
(with D19S606 and D19S1182 as backup). All markers are microsatellites (2 or 4 
nt repeats) except PLA2G4C which is a minisatellite (26 nt repeat) 
polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score, 
arnplicon size, and ease of interpretation. The backup markers are used if the 
first line markers at that chromosome arm are uninformative or otherwise 
ambiguous in their interpretation. LOR at all informative loci on each 
chromosomal arm represents the typical finding in oligodendrogliomas with 1p 
and 19q deletion.

Received in formalin ,multiple whitish -brown ,soft and irregular tissue fragments,
measuring together 6 .2 x 3.0 x 1.5 cm and weighing 13.0g.
Microscopy:
Histological sections stained with H & E demonstrate partial brain parenchymal
infiltration by glial neoplasm composed of two cell populations of oligodendroglial and
astrocytic phenotype .The oligodendroglial component is represented by round nuclei
cells, delicate chromatin and inconspicuous nucleoli ,with scant cytoplasm. Such cells
infiltrate the adjacent neocortex ,in the form of isolated cells, forming small aggregates
around neurons (Neuronal satellitosis ).In some areas ,there is vacuolation of neuropil,
with formation of microcysts ,inbasophil -rich and mucinous matrix .The astrocytic
component ,less obvious ,is represented by cells of irregular nuclei ,dense chromatin
and eosinophilic cytoplasm ,with imprecise limits, infiltrating predominantly white
substance ,which shows areas with refractive neuropil and occasional reactive
astrocytes .Mitotic figures are rare in this material .Itwas not observed vessels with
microvessel proliferation or areas of necrosis .It is evident ,also, some fragments of
neocortex free of involvement by neoplasia.

nucleoli. In a few areas the cells more closely resemble neoplastic 
astrocytes. Other areas show mucinous pools or distinct microcystic 
architecture. The infiltrating tumor cells show prominent perineuronal 
satellitosis and perivascular spread. Some areas of the tumor show background 
ropy myelin. Many of these features are characteristic of oligodendroglial 
tumors. Occasional tumor cells are GFAP positive. GFAP positive reactive 
astrocytes are present. The tumor cells are CD20 and CD3 negative. NeuN 
highlights cortical neurons and perhaps a few tumor cell nuclei. Alcian blue is noncontributory. 
The tumor shows demonstrates moderate p53 staining and the Ki-67 labeling 
index is approximately 35%. 
This tumor shows distinct oligodendroglial and to a lesser extent astrocytic 
features, including astrocytic gemistocytes. The latter observation is 
complicated by the presence of numerous reactive astrocytes and some 
oligodendroglial mini-gemistocytes. 
The differential diagnosis includes anaplastic oligodendroglioma or anaplastic 
oligoastrocytoma (WHO Grade III) and glioblastoma wit 
component (WHO Grade IV). The patient's corresponding _t. • •• -,... _ 
slides were also reviewed. Clinical correlation is necessary. 
MGMT promoter methylation and EGFRvIII assays are pending and the results, 
which will be reported in procedure addenda, may help guide appropriate 
t~ 'py. 
Ipl9q LOH testing is recommended.

gray soft material. 
XI-X3 -representative of each piece. 
 
MICROSCOPIC: A,B. Portions of a glial neoplastic proliferation. The 
neoplastic cells have anaplastic elongated nuclei disposed in a heavy 
fibrillary background. There are occasional mitotic figures. There is 
capillary-type microvasculature with interanastomosing vessels, and 
focally there is microvascular cellular proliferation. There is no 
necrosis. 
SPECIAL STAINS: Immunoperoxidase methods for GFAP and MIB-1 were 
performed on sections from blocks #2 and x3. 
The GFAP demonstrates the glial fibrillary background of the 
tumor. With the MIB-1 labelling indices of 12% and 16% were 
determined 
in the more active areas. 
 COMMENT: The lesion is a glial neoplasm with heavy glial 
fibrillogenesis. The tumor cells have nuclear anaplastic features, 
mitotic figures are occasionally observed, and microvascular cellular 
proliferation is present focally. Necrosis is absent. The neoplasm 
is 
a high histological grade glioma (WHO grade IV/IV), however devoid of 
necrosis. The interanastomosing pattern of the microvasculature 
suggests an oligodendroglial component. 
ADDENDUM REPORT 
B. 
Tissue not previously submitted from this specimen is now submitted in 
total, #x4-x9. 
Microscopically, this tissue corresponds to brain diffusely and 
extensively infiltrated by a neoplastic proliferation similar to that 
one described above. In here, microvascular calcification and a 
microvascular network of vessels is more prominent. In a couple of 
microscopic areas there is tumor necrosis associated with 
microvascular 
cellular proliferation. 
The presence of microscopic zones of necrosis would justify the 
designation of this tumor as glioblastoma multiforme. Again, an 
oligodendroglial component is probable in this tumor. "," 1. ""Site"": Brain. Justified as the report specifically mentions the brain as the site.
2. ""Laterality"": Left. Justified as the report mentions ""Left temporal lobe"" as the location of the tumor.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION One aspect 
with 
gray-white 
IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY: In part A, the GFAP demonstrates heavy 
gliofibrillogenesis by the neoplastic cells, including some ganglion-like 
cells. In part B, the GFAP depicts extensive spindle cell areas that are 
negative and intermingled with GFAP-positive strands. Only a small minority 
(about 5%) of cells over expresses the p53 protein. The CD163 marks a large 
number of cells, presumably phagocytic. With the MIB-1 there is a 
proliferation index of about 18% in the more active areas. 
SPECIAL STAIN: The Snook's reticulum demonstrates heavy reticulin deposition 
in the spindle, GFAP-negative areas. 
The stains results are consistent with a high histological grade glial 
neoplasm that has a sarcomatoid component.

GROSS PATHOLOGY: Received fresh, two fragments, 1.1 cm. across, in
aggregate. Soft, focally hemorrhagic and glistening. In total #1 and
2.
INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION: Brain, right temporal: Glioma, high
histological grade.
AskB.
SPECIMEN: Right temporal tumor - permanent.
FIXATIVE: Saline.
GENERAL: A 2.0 x 1.8 x 0.2 cm. aggregate of numerous, fragmented
tan-red soft tissue fragments and scanty blood clot.
SECTIONS: Xl,X2 - all submitted.
MICROSCOPIC: A. Portions of cerebrum effaced by a neoplastic
proliferation of glial cells. The neoplasm is very cellular and made
up of round or ovoid neoplastic nuclei with anaplastic features. The
background is fibrillary and has prominent microvascular cellular
proliferation. Mitotic figures are very frequent. There is individual
cell necrosis and areas of geographic tumor necrosis. At the periphery
of the tumor, neoplastic cells have perinuclear halos suggestive of an
oligodendroglial nature.
B. Portions of brain with a neoplasm similar to that one described for
part A. However, in this specimen there are zones of clearly
identifiable anaplastic oligodendroglioma, and extensive areas of
necrosis.
SPECIAL STAINS: Immunoperoxidase methods for GFAP and MIB-1 were
performed on block #2. The GFAP demonstrates a moderately fibrillary
background, and highlights the prominent microvascular cellular
proliferation. With the MIB-1 a labelling index of 37% is determined.
COMMENT: In this material there is a high histological grade glioma
that in less anaplastic areas has an oligodendroglial phenotype . The
neoplasm has prominent nuclear anaplasia, mitotic activity,
microvascular cellular proliferation, and areas of tumor necrosis,

CLINICAL HISTORY: 
Left parietal neoplasm 191.3. MRI Findings: Post gadolinium thin section 
imaging was obtained through the brain with fiducial markers in place for the 
purposes of preoperative localization. A peripherally enhancing mass in the 
left parietal region, with a broad contact against the dura is again seen, 
which is not significantly changed compared with prior outside MRI. There is 
mass effect results in effacement of the atrium and occipital horn of the left 
lateral ventricle, as Hell as partial effacement of the left ambient / 
quadrigeminal plate cistern by the posterior medial temporal lobe. This also 
remains unchanged. L01;'l Tl signal in the left parietal lobe is not 
significantly changed in distribution given differences in technique.

COMMENT 
The specimen is portions of cerebrum that are extensively and 
moderately to 
heavily infiltrated by a glial neoplastic proliferation. The 
neoplastic cells 
tend to have round or oval nuclei, and focally have a gemistocytic 
phenotype. 
Focally there is nuclear anaplasia and some mitotic activity, with a 
MIB-l 
proliferation index of 5% to 7% in the more active areas. There is 
neovascularization throughout the tumor. Focally, there is also 
microvascular 
cellular proliferation with karyorrhexis t and one microscopic area of 
tumor necrosis with pseudopalisading.  tumor necrosis with pseudopalisading. 
The neoplasm is a high histological grade astrocytoma, perhaps with an 
oligodendroglial component. The larger portion of the neoplasm has an 
anaplastic phenotype; however, focally it has features of a 
glioblastoma: 
microvascular cellular proliferation and tumor necrosis.

Testing was performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block 
DNA extracted from a corresponding blood specimen was used as a normal 
reference control. 
H slide was examined and no microdissection was 
needed. 
TEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA 
(baseline)/ Tumor DNA pairs using 3 markers at both 1p and 19q. The 3 
markers 
on 1p are D1S548, D1S1592, and D1S552 (with D1S468, D1S1612, and 
D18496 as 
backup markers) and the 3 markers on 19q are D19S219, D198412, and 
PLA2G4C 
(with D198606 and D1981182 as backup). All markers are microsatellites 
(2 or 4 
nt repeats) except PLA2G4C which is a minisatellite (26 nt repeat) 
polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score, 
amplicon size, and ease of interpretation. The backup markers are used 
if the 
first line markers at that chromosome arm are uninformative or 
otherwise 
ambiguous in their interpretation. LOH at all informative loci on each 
chromosomal arm represents the typical finding in oligodendrogliomas 
with 1p 
and 19q deletion.  FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results 
from a 
stand-alone diagnostic test. This test was developed and its 
performance 
characteristics determined by the laboratory as 
required by CLIA ' III regulations. It has not been cleared or approved

has 
determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These 
results are 
provided for informational purposes only, and should be interpreted 
only in 
the context of established procedures and/or diagnostic criteria. 
TECHNICAL SENSITIVITY: The presence of >15% non-neoplastic cells in

may preclude the detection of allelic loss. 
Interpretation 
NEGATIVE: No evidence of methylated MGMT promoter is detected.

needed. 
TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT 
promoter 
have been shown to benefit from therapy with alkylating agents. 
Assessment of 
MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite treatment of DNA 
followed 
by real-time PCR amplification (MethyLight) of methylated and 
unmethylated DNA 
sequences. The analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by 
serial 
dilution of methylated positive control DNA into unmethylated DNA, and 
was 
assessed to be 1% of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated 
DNA. 
Factors such as the presence of >50% non-neoplastic cells in the 
sample, or 
extensive tissue necrosis, may preclude the detection of methylated 
MGMT 
promoter sequences.  FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results
