)"," Site: Multiple sites including left constrictor muscle, soft palate margin, lateral pharyngeal margin, left tongue base margin, posterior tonsillar pillar margin, and left radical tonsillectomy. Justification: The report includes separate descriptions for each specimen received, indicating different surgical margins and the main tumor site.

Laterality: Left side of the oral cavity and oropharynx. Justification: All the sites and specimens mentioned in the report are from the left side, indicating that the surgery was performed on the left side.

Histology: Squamous cell carcinoma. Justification: The report mentions ""in situ carcinoma"" and ""invasive carcinoma,"" which are types of squamous cell carcinoma. Additionally, the tumor cells are strongly positive for p16, indicating a high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, which is commonly associated with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.

Stage: Not provided. Justification: The report does not include information about the size of the tumor or the presence of metastasis, which are necessary for determining the stage of the cancer.

Grade: Not provided. Justification: The report does not include information about the differentiation of the tumor cells, which is necessary for determining the grade of the cancer.

Behavior: Malignant. Justification: The report mentions ""in situ carcinoma"" and ""invasive carcinoma,"" indicating that the tumor has the potential to invade surrounding tissues and metastasize, which is characteristic of malignant behavior.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

History Case Pathology Report 
File under: Pathology History Case Pathology "," 1. ""Site"": Anterior mandible and floor of mouth, as the report mentioned the location of the resection.
2. ""Laterality"": Not provided, as the report does not mention if the anomaly is left or right-sided.
3. ""Histology"": Poorly differentiated squamous carcinoma, as the report clearly states this.
4. ""Stage"": TNM format would require information on tumor size, lymph node involvement, and metastasis, which are not all provided in this report. Therefore, a stage cannot be accurately determined from this report.
5. ""Grade"": Poorly differentiated, as stated in the report.
6. ""Behavior"": Malignant, as the tumor is invading surrounding tissues and bones.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Specimen M is labeled ""left hemimandible with level 1 lymph
nodes"" and holds a left hemimandibulectomy specimen. The
specimen is approximately 10.5'cm from anterior to posterior x
4.7 cm lateral to midline x 5.2 cm from superior to inferior.
The mandible is transected posteriorly through the ramus
resulting in two surgical margins, 1 superior and 1 anterior
(2.5 and 2.1 cm each). The anterior mandibular margin is 3.0 cm.
The mandible is notable for two teeth present anteriorly
immediately posterior to the second tooth. The tumor extends
6.0 cm from anterior to posterior and 2.2 cm from lateral edge
to midline. There is a tan firm mass, centered on the mandible and extending
into the buccal mucosa. The mucosal margins are differentially
inked anterior/lateral/posterior edge/black, anterior midline
and posterior edge/blue. The surrounding soft tissue lateral
inferior midline and posterior is inked green. The mass at its
closest approach to the mucosal margins is 0.4 cm from the blue
inked midline, black inked anterior, black inked posterior, and
is greater than 1 cm from the black inked lateral edge.
Along the inner edge of the mandible, there are four palpable
lymph nodes, ranging from 0.5 to 3.0 cm. The lymph nodes lift
freely from the bone of the mandible and are surrounded by
yellow lobulated fat and yellow lobulated glandular tissue. The
tissue along the lateral edge of the mandible is comprised of
red/brown muscle. The mass on section comes to within 0.5 cm of
this muscle.
Sectioning reveals that the mass extends into the mandible,
coming to within 2.5 cm of the anterior bone margin and greater
than 4 cm from the posterior bone margin.
A portion of tumor is submitted to tissue procurement.
A photograph of the specimen is taken.

Gross Description
Specimen A is received fresh in a container labeled with the patient's name, medical record number and identified as
""total laryngectomy."" The specimen consists of a total laryngectomy specimen measuring 9.3 x 5.2 x 4.3 cm in total
dimension from the tip of the epiglottis to the inferior tracheal edge with attached hyoid bone measuring 9.5 x 0.5 x
0.7 cm and the left thyroid lobe measuring 4.1 x 3.3 x 2.2 cm. The larynx is opened posteriorly on the midline at the
time of frozen section analysis. There are three tracheal rings attached.
There is a tan -white appearing mass measuring 2.5 x 1.9 cm in surface area and 2.2 cm in thickness involving the
glottic larynx. The mass is grossly located on the bilateral false cord, vestibule true cord and crosses the midline.
The mass does not appear to involve pyriform sinus. Grossly, the mass extends 2.4 cm from the tip of the epiglottic
mucosal edge, 2.3 cm from the base of the tongue mucosal edge, 2.4 cm from the lateral right mucosal edge, 1.1 cm
from the lateral left mucosal edge and 3.1 cm from the distal tracheal edge. None of the tracheal rings grossly
appear involved the mass. On the anterior aspect of the specimen is an ellipse of abnormal skin measuring 4.5 x 4.3
x 1.0 cm. The inferior aspect of the skin ellipse measures 2.3 cm from the distal tracheal edge. A tan-white, irregular
ulceration is identified measuring 2.2 x 1.7 cm and is present 2.5 cm from the inferior skin edge, 1.6 cm from the left
skin edge, 1.1 cm from the right skin edge and 0.9 cm from the superior skin edge. The skin defect grossly does not
appear to communicate with the mass lesion. There is a left lobe of the thyroid gland present. The cut surface is
homogenous and beefy red. A colloid nodule measuring 1.3 x 1.1 x 0.5 cm is noted. On sectioning, the lesion
grossly invades the anterior commissure as well as the pre-epiglottic space as well as possible full thickness invasion
of the thyroid cartilage. Sections are taken as listed in the cassette summary after decalcification. Representative
section of tumor is submitted for Tumor Bank at the time of frozen section analysis. The specimen is inked as listed
in the inking code. Dictated by

"," Site: Oral Cavity
The report includes descriptions and measurements of specimens from various sites in the oral cavity, including the right tongue posterior margin, right buccal posterior lateral margin, right buccal anterior lateral margin, and right floor of mouth.

Laterality: Right
The tumor is located on the right side of the oral cavity, as indicated by the specimens from the right tongue, right buccal mucosa, and right perifacial lymph node.

Histology: Squamous cell carcinoma
Although not explicitly stated in the report, the description of a ""tumor"" and the mention of histologic grade suggest that the diagnosis is squamous cell carcinoma.

Stage: pT3 pN2b
The tumor is classified as pT3 due to its greatest dimension of more than 4 cm, and as pN2b due to metastasis in multiple ipsilateral lymph nodes, none more than 6 cm in greatest dimension.

Grade: G2 (Moderately differentiated)
The tumor is moderately differentiated, which means that it has intermediate characteristics between well-differentiated and poorly differentiated tumors.

Behavior: Malignant
The report indicates a diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma, which is a malignant tumor that can invade surrounding tissues and metastasize to distant sites.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST),,III (high grade),malignant,TCGA-HD-8224.pdf,   ," Report: 
The sample consists of a fragment of soft tissue measuring 3.5 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm. Microscopic examination reveals features consistent with a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST), WHO Grade III. No specific sites of origin are identified, but the lesion is abutting and possibly arising from a nerve bundle. There is no evidence of residual schwannoma or neurofibroma within this sample. The specimen shows focal areas of tumor necrosis. Mitotic activity is brisk (>10 mitoses/10 high power fields). Surgical margins are widely involved by the tumor. No lymphovascular invasion is identified.

_______________________________________________________________ 
GROSS DESCRIPTION: The specimen is received in 5 parts. 
Part 1 is received fresh labeled with the patient's name, initials xx 
and 
""right supraglottic lesion"".  Received are 2, irregular, soft to 
rubbery, tan, 
 tissue biopsies each measuring 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm.  A touch prep is 
performed 
with an intraoperative diagnosis completed. The specimen is entirely 
submitted 
for processing in a cassette labeled 1A.  
Part 2 is received fresh labeled with the patient's name, initials xx and 
""right zone 2B node"".  Received is a single, tan, oval, soft to 
rubbery, lymph 
node measuring 0.5 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm.  The specimen is inked, bisected and 
entirely submitted for processing in a cassette labeled 2A.  
Part 3 is received fresh labeled with the patient's name, initials xx 
and 
""right neck level 2, 3, and 4"".  Received is an irregular unoriented 13 
x 4.5 
x 1.3 cm right selective neck dissection, presumably lymph node levels 
2 
through 4 without an orienting suture.  Neck dissection is divided 
equally 
into 3 segments.  The measurements for the lymph node- containing soft 
tissue 
levels are as follows: Level A- 4.2 X 3.5 X 1.5 cm, level B-  4.3 x 4 x 
1.0 cm, 
and level C-  4 x 3.2 x 1.5 cm.  Multiple lymph nodes, ranging from 0.2 
to 2.0 
cm in greatest dimension are identified.  Several of the larger lymph nodes 
appear to be tumor involved and are present in greater numbers within 
level A. 
  Lymph nodes are entirely submitted in cassettes labeled: 
3A - level A -  six possible lymph nodes 
3B - level A- six possible lymph nodes 
3C - level A - single bisected lymph node 
3D - level A single bisected lymph node 
3E - level B- seven possible lymph nodes 
3F - level C- 9 possible lymph nodes 
Part 4 is received fresh labeled with the patient's name, initials xx 
and 
""left neck level 2, 3 and 4"".  Received is an irregular unoriented 11.5 
x 6 x 
1.2 cm left selective neck dissection, presumably lymph node levels 2 through 
4 without an orienting suture.  Neck dissection is divided equally into 
3 
segments.  The measurements for the lymph node- containing soft tissue 
levels are as follows: Level A- 4.3 X 3.5 X 1.25 cm, level B-  5.5 x 3.1 x 0.8 
cm, and level C-  4 x 3 x 1.2 cm.  Multiple lymph nodes, ranging from 0.2 to 2.0 
cm in greatest dimension are identified.  Several of the larger lymph nodes appear 
to be tumor involved and are present in greater numbers within level A.   
Lymph nodes are entirely submitted in cassettes labeled: 
4A - level A -  four possible lymph nodes 
4B - level A-  single possible lymph node 
4C  level B-  seven lymph node  4D  level B - one lymph node 
4E - level C- eight possible lymph nodes 
4F - level C- three possible lymph nodes 
Part 5 is received fresh labeled with the patient's name, initials xx 
and 
""larynx"".   The specimen consists of total laryngectomy measuring 8.5 cm 
(superior to inferior), by 4.2 cm (anterior to posterior), by 5.8 cm 
(width) 
when reconstructed.  The specimen includes the hyoid bone which is 
removed.  
The hyoid bone measures 8.2 cm in length by 0.3 x 0.3 cm in greatest 
dimension.  One tracheal ring is identified.  There is a supraglottic 
irregular exophytic ulcerated mass measuring at least 2.8 x 2.2 cm in 
maximal 
dimension.  The tumor is centered at the level of the supraglotttis and more 
prominent and cavitary toward the right side.  The tumor appears to 
compress/invade the right and left false vocal cords as well as the 
anterior 
pyriform sinus.  The tumor is grossly located at 1.3 cm from the right arytenoid mucosal margin, 1.8 cm from the left arytenoid margin, 3.0 cm 
from 
the epiglottic margin and at 3.2 cm from the jugular margin (inferior).  
The 
anterior soft tissue margin appears intact and no gross lesion is identified.  
Upon sectioning the tumor measures 4.8 cm superior to inferior by 3.2 cm 
anterior to posterior, by 4.5 cm in width.  It involves the pre-
epiglottic space, paraglottic space and anterior soft tissue.  The tumor appears 
to 
superficially invade the thyroid cartilage as well as epiglottic 
cartilage.  
The anterior soft tissue margin including muscle and fibroadipose tissue 
appears uninvolved by tumor.  The right thyroid lobe is identified 
measuring 
3.2 x 2.5 x 0.8 cm in greatest dimension.  No parathyroid tissue is 
identified.  On section no discrete, well circumscribed or ill defined 
lesions 
en.  A section of the tumor was selected and   
 
i red and banked.  The specimen is submitted in fourteen cassettes as follows: 
5A  epiglottic margin, perpendicular 
5B  tracheal (deep) margin, shaved 
5C  right arytenoid margin, perpendicular 
5D  left arytenoid margin, perpendicular 5E  right anterior soft tissue margin  (area inked blue is not a 
margin)  
5F  tumor and thyroid cartilage right side 
5G  supraglottic tumor area right side 
5H  - ventricle tumor area right side 
5I  anterior soft tissue margin left side 
 5J  tumor and epiglottic cartilage 
5K  ventricle tumor area left side 
5L  tumor and thyroid cartilage left side 
5M  5N  representative section of thyroid gland.  
On Part 5 cassettes A, B, F, H, J and L will be placed in decalcifying

Microscopic Discussion:
Sections demonstrate a paraganglioma characterized by a proliferation of monotonous cells with round
nuclei and salt and pepper chromatin, prominent red nucleoli and esoinophilic cytoplasm. These cells
are arranged in small nests surrounded by a delicate capillary network. One mitotic figure per 10 high-
power fields is identified. Bands of fibroelastic tissue intersect the tumor cells. Few entrapped nerve
fibers are also seen. Necrosis is not identified.

"," Site: The specimens are from various sites including the right and left neck dissections, base of tongue, left lateral pharynx, and larynx. This is necessary to examine the extent of the malignancy.

Laterality: The tumors are located on both sides of the body, with one on the right laryngectomy and the other on the glottic segment of the left laryngectomy. This information is crucial for determining the appropriate treatment.

Histology: Both tumors are moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinomas. This type of cancer is common in the head and neck region, and the histological grade helps determine the aggressiveness of the tumor.

Stage: The right laryngectomy tumor is staged as pT3 pN2c, indicating a relatively advanced stage of cancer with positive lymph nodes. The left glottic tumor is staged as pT1a pN0, indicating an early-stage cancer without positive lymph nodes.

Grade: Both tumors are moderately differentiated, which suggests an intermediate level of aggressiveness. This information is important for determining the prognosis and appropriate treatment.

Behavior: The behavior of the tumor is malignant, as it is a cancer that can invade surrounding tissues and metastasize to other parts of the body. This information is crucial for determining the appropriate treatment and follow-up care.

Not provided: Other categories such as chemoradiation therapy, organ transplant, immunosuppression, and cytogenetics tests are not provided in the report. These factors can influence the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, and it is important to obtain this information from the medical record or the treating physician.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 "," Site: Multiple sites in the mouth and neck
Laterality: Right side of the mouth and right lymph nodes
Histology: Squamous cell carcinoma or similar (based on H&E staining)
Stage: pT2, pN0, M0, indicating a stage II cancer (not provided: TNM status post-chemoradiation therapy)
Grade: Not provided (requires additional histologic features not given in the report)
Behavior: Malignant (invasive carcinoma)

Justification: The site is determined from the procedure and specimen description, which includes lymph nodes and multiple sites in the mouth. Laterality is specified as right for most of the specimens. Histology is assumed to be squamous cell carcinoma based on the H&E staining mentioned in the report. Stage is determined using the pTNM classification, with T2 from the procedure description (lesion >2 cm but not through the cortical layer), N0 (no regional lymph node involvement found), and M0 (no distant metastasis). Grade requires additional histologic features not provided in the report. The behavior is malignant based on the diagnosis of carcinoma.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lung,,Adenocarcinoma,T2 N0 M0,II,Malignant,TCGA-BB-7864.pdf,     ," Report: The sample was obtained from the lung of a 67-year-old patient. A moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma was identified, invading the visceral pleura with no evidence of lymph node or distant metastasis.

1. Site: Lung - Justification: The report explicitly states that the sample was obtained from the lung.
2. Laterality: Not provided - Justification: There is no mention of laterality in the report.
3. Histology: Adenocarcinoma - Justification: The report clearly mentions a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.
4. Stage: T2 N0 M0 - Justification: The tumor invaded the visceral pleura (T2), but no lymph node or distant metastasis was found (N0, M0).
5. Grade: II - Justification: The report describes the adenocarcinoma as moderately differentiated, which corresponds to Grade II.
6. Behavior: Malignant - Justification: The tumor is invasive, growing into the visceral pleura, indicating malignant behavior.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

squamous mucosa.  AJCC PATHOLOGIC TNM STAGE: pT4a pN2b 
 
NOTE: This pathologic stage assessment is based on information available at the time of this report, and is subject to change 
pending clinical review and additional information. 
  Comment: 
The frozen section diagnoses are confirmed. 
 
The surgical resection margins are free of definite involvement 
by tumor. The tumor does extend deeply into the muscle of the 
hemiglossectomy specimen and extends far anteriorly. An anterior 
tip section was taken and submitted en face initially which revealed a focus of submucosal invasive squamous cell carcinoma. 
This section is subsequently bisected and submitted as 
perpendicular sections revealing the invasive carcinoma to be present beneath an intact anterior surface squamous mucosa. The inked true margins in the anterior tip section are negative for 
definite tumor.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:  
The specimen is received fresh in four parts labeled with the patient's  name,  
initials xx and medical record number.  Part 1 is designated ""right level 1B neck dissection"".  It consists of a  
submandibular gland (3 x 2.5 x 2 cm) and attached fibroadipose tissue (6.5 x  
4.5 x 2.5 cm).  The cut surface of the gland is tan -white a nd multilobated.  
Four lymph nodes are identified in the fibroadipose tissue varying in size  
from 1.2 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm to 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm.  Representative sections are  
submitted as follows:  
1A  submandibular gland  
1B  one lymph node bisected  
1C  two lymph  nodes  
1D  two lymph nodes.  
Part 2 is designated ""right hemiglossectomy"".  The specimen measures 7 x 6 x  
 3.5 cm overall.  The lateral surface shows two ulcers measuring 3.5 x 2.5 cm  
(ulcer #1) and 1.5 x 1 cm (ulcer #2), respectively.  The larger ulcer is 1 cm  
from the anterior margin, 1.4 cm from the dorsal/deep margin and 1.1 cm away  
from the ventral/deep margin.  The smaller ulcer is 0.5 cm away from the  
dorsal/deep margin and 2.5 cm away from the ventral/deep margin and 0.5 cm  
from the posterior margin.   All the margins were evaluated intraoperatively.  
On serial sectioning, the larger ulcer shows a tan white mass (1.2 cm deep).  
The smaller ulcer also shows a tan white mass (0.2 cm in depth).  The two  
masses grossly appear to be continuous with each othe r.

I have personally reviewed all specimens and or slides ,including the
listed special stains, and used them with my medical judgement to
determine the final diagnosis.
CLINICAL HISTORY:
The patient is a -year-old female with tonsil cancer .Operative
Procedure: Right radical tonsillectomy with right neck dissection.
GROSS:
Six containers are received ,each labeled with the patient's name, and medical record number.
A. The first container is received fresh and subsequently received in formalin and additionally labeled ""A - right tonsil .""The specimen
consists of a 4 .1 x 4.0 x 2 .3 cm radical tonsillectomy specimen. The
surgeon was present in the gross room and oriented the specimen. The
specimen is also oriented with a stitch at superior aspect. The
specimen is inked as follows :superior =orange ,inferior = blue,
anterior =green ,posterior =red and deep =black .A 1.6 x 0.7 cm
tan-white ,well-defined ulcer is present on the mucosal surface, which
is 0.9 cm to the closest inferior margin .Sectioning reveals a 2.5 x
1.7 x 1.5 cm white firm well- defined mass deep to the ulcer within the
submucosal tissue .This mass is less than 0 .1 cm to deep margin, 0.2 cm
to anterior ,0.7 cm to posterior, 1.0 cm to superior and 0.6 cm to
inferior margin respectively. Representative sections of the mass were
procured for potential future studies .Remainder of tissue is entirely
submitted.

Al-A2 - superior margin, perpendicular.
A3-A4 - inferior margin ,perpendicular.
AS-All - remainder of tissue sequentially proceeding from superior to
inferior aspect related to anterior random posterior margins.
B.The next container is additionally labeled ""B - right
parapharyngeal margin."" The specimen consists of four yellow-red
fibroadipose tissues measuring ranging from 0.3 to 0.7 cm in greatest
dimension and 1.0 x 0 .5 x 0.2 cm in aggregate .Entirely wrapped in Al. C. Thenext container is labeled ""C - right 2A .""The specimen
consists of a 4.3 x 3 .5 x 1.7 cm portion of yellow -red firm fibroadipose
tissue .Sectioning reveals a 3.8 x 3 .2 x 2.0 cm white firm mass with
solid cut surface. Also two lymph nodes measuring 0.8 and 1.0 cm in
greatest dimension are noted. Representative sections are submitted.
Summary of Sections:
C1- largest firm mass.
C2-C3 - one lymph node in each.
D. The next container is labeled ""D - right level 3."" The specimen
consists of a 4.5 x 2.5 x 0.7 cm portion of yellow-red fibroadipose
tissue .Sectioning reveals six lymph nodes ranging from 0.3 to 2.0 cm
in greatest dimension .All lymph nodes are entirely submitted.
Summary of Sections:
D1-D3 - one lymph node in each.
D4 - three lymph nodes.
E.The next container is labeled ""E - right 2B."" The specimen
consists of 2.0 x 1.5 x 1. 5 cm yellow-white fibroadipose tissue.
Sectioning reveals three lymph nodes ranging from 0.5 to 0.7 cm in
greatest dimension .The specimen is entirely submitted. Summary of Sections:
E1-E3 - one lymph node in each.
F.The next container is labeled ""F - right level 4."" The specimen
consists of a 3.0 x 1.8 x 1.2 cm portion of yellow fibroadipose tissue.
Sectioning reveals 14 possible lymph nodes ranging from 0.2 to 0.4 cm in
greatest dimension .The entire specimen is submitted.
Summary of Sections:
F1-F2 - four lymph node in each.
F3-F4 - three lymph nodes in each.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A)Received fresh designated ""right level II"" is a 2.1 x 1.1 x 0.4 cm piece
of fibrofatty tissue, which is bisected parallel to the long axis. Specimen
has a pale tan cut surface. Entirely submitted in Al.
B)Received in a container of formalin labeled ""..., right neck dissection""
is a 10 x 4.8 x 2 cm yellow lobulated portion of fibrofatty tissue. There is
a double suture attached to the level II region and a single suture attached
to the level IV region. The specimen is sectioned and in the level II region
there is a 4.5 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm tan lobulated salivary gland. It is serially
sectioned and has tan lobulated cut surfaces. No masses or lesions are
identified. The specimen is divided into levels II, III, IV, and V. In the
level II region there is a 2 x 2 x 1 cm previously incised tan-gray friable
apparent grossly involved lymph node. The remaining regions are sectioned
and have fibrofatty cut surfaces and numerous candidate lymph nodes are
identified ranging from 0.1-2.5 cm in greatest dimension. No additional
metastatic disease is grossly appreciated. Representative sections are
submitted as follows: B1 - salivary gland; B2 - sections of grossly involved
level II lymph node; B3 - two level II bisected lymph nodes, one inked blue;
B4 - three level III candidate lymph nodes; B5 - seven level IV candidate
lymph nodes; B6 - one bisected level IV lymph node; B7 - four level V
candidate lymph nodes; B8 - four level V candidate lymph nodes; B9 - one
bisected level V lymph node; B10 - one bisected level V lymph node.
C)Received fresh designated ""right level V"" is one piece of yellow
fibrofatty tissue measuring 4 x 2 x 0.5 cm. The specimen is examined for
potential lymph nodes and seven potential lymph node candidates are
identified. The largest candidate is inked black and bisected, and all lymph
node candidates are submitted in cassette Cl.
D)Received fresh designated ""inferior margin"" is a 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm
piece of whitish red fibrous tissue, which is inked black and entirely
submitted for frozen section analysis, after which it is thawed and submitted
in cassette
E)Received fresh designated ""right composite resection, single stitch
anterior lateral, double stitch posterior medial"" is a 5.8 x 5.2 x 5.4 cm
composite resection including a portion of the bony maxilla with three teeth,
the soft tissue lateral to the mandible, and associated soft tissue superior
to the mandible including a portion of a lower molar (mandibular bone is not
present). The buccal surface of the oral cavity, lateral to the teeth, has
an exophytic, friable lesion which extends along the posterior mucosal
surface to the medial aspect of the specimen where it is present medial to
the upper and lower teeth. Grossly, this exophytic lesion is at least 2.5 x
3.5 x 2.5 cm on initial examination. The egdes of the lesion are grossly 0.5
cm from the posterior mucosal margin, 0.8 cm from the inferior mucosal
margin, 0.5 cm from the anterior mucosal margin, and 0.5 cm from the superior
mucosal margin. On initial gross examination, this lesion does not appear to
extend through the fibrofatty tissue located lateral to the buccal surface. Using the orientation provided per surgeon (single stitch anterior lateral,
double stitch posterior medial), the mucosal margins are inked in the
following manner: anterior = blue; superior = black; medial = red; inferior
= green. The lateral soft tissue margin is inked orange, the inferior soft
tissue is inked green, the superior soft tissue is inked black, the medial
soft tissue is inked red, and the posterior soft tissue margin is inked blue
over green. Representative shave margins are taken from the inferior and
anterior mucosal surfaces. The specimen is then cut in a transverse plane,
separating the maxilla from the mandibular soft tissue, and each piece is
serially sectioned. The tumor has a firm white cut surface, with friable
areas, and grossly extends to within 0.1 mm of the deep inked margin (blue
over green), within 0.1 cm of the inked medial soft tissue margin (red),
within 0.1 cm of the inked lateral soft tissue margin (orange),and within 0.2
cm of the inferior soft tissue margin (green). On sectioning, the tumor
appears larger than on original examination, and measures 4.5 x 4.0 x 2.5 cm.
The upper maxillary bone is focally sectioned and has foci suspicious for
bony involvement; these areas are submitted for decalcification.
Cassette summary: El - representative shave margins from the inferior and
anterior mucosal margins; E2 - representative perpendicular margins from the
medial and superior mucosal margins; E3 - representative sections of neoplasm
in relationship to deep soft tissue margin; E4 - relationship of neoplasm and
closest medial soft tissue margin; E5 - relationship of neoplasm and closest
lateral soft tissue margin; E6 - relationship of neoplasm and superior soft
tissue margin; E7 - representative sections of superior upper lateral mucosa
in relationship to inked mucosal margin; E8 - relationship of neoplasm and
inferior inked margin; E9-E10 - composite cross section through neoplasm;
Ell- E12 - upper maxillary bone..
F)Received fresh designated ""buccal tumor"" is one piece of whitish red
fibrous tissue, 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm. The specimen is entirely submitted in

Histology: Invasive keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma
Stage: The minimum pathologic stage is pT3 N2 M0 (AJCC 6th edition, 2002)
Grade: Well-to-moderately differentiated
Behavior: Malignant
Justification: The diagnosis of invasive squamous cell carcinoma is based on the biopsy of the buccal tumor and the composite resection of the maxillary bone and attached soft tissue. The stage and grade are assigned based on the size of the primary tumor, the presence of metastasis to regional lymph nodes, and the degree of differentiation of the cancer cells.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

COMMENT: The tumor lesion in the pyriform sinus corresponds to AJCC stage       IVA (pT2, N2b, MX). Assuming the tumor in the base of the tongue        represents a separate lesion, it corresponds to AJCC stage II (pT2).    
 Although the lesion in specimen 9 is noted to extend to an inked edge, the      
final surgical margins of resection, represented separately, are negative       
for malignancy.         **Electronically Signed Out by

Received fresh labeled, ""larynx, pharynx, thyroid, level 6 lymph nodes,"" is     
a 9.0 x 4.5 x 3.5 cm laryngeal specimen. The specimen is inked as follows:      left-blue, right-black. After inking the specimen, the anterior larynx is       opened to reveal all structures described. Within the specimen, there is a      5.5 x 3.4 x 2.5 cm left pharynx. The epiglottis measures 3.5 x 3.0 x 0.2 cm     with a pink-tan mucosal surface. Distal to the epiglottis are the bilateral     arytenoids, which measure 2.1 x 0.8 x 0.7 cm on the left and 1.5 x 0.9 x        0.5 cm on the right. Both arytenoids are pink-tan and soft with no gross        abnormalities. The false vocal cords measure 2.0 cm on the left and 1.5 cm      on the right. Distal to the false vocal cords are the bilateral ventricles      and true vocal cords. The true vocal cords measure 1.8 cm on the left and       2.0 cm on the right. Bilateral false and true vocal cords are pink-tan in       color. Distal to the true vocal cords is the subglottis, which leads to the     trachea. There is a 2.6 cm portion of trachea removed with the specimen.        The posterior surface of the specimen contains the hyoid bone, which is identified superiorly to the horns of the cricoid cartilage. The horn of        the left cricoid cartilage is not grossly visible. The left piriform sinus      contains a nodular pink-tan lesion that measures 3.5 x 3.0 cm. The lesion       involves the entire piriform sinus. On the posterior side of the specimen,      there is muscle tissue identified and a vein that measures 9.5 x 3.5 cm.        The vein is clipped at both ends. The left lobe of the thyroid is       identified and measures 3.5 x 2.6 x 0.8 cm. Also removed distal to the  thyroid gland are the level 6 lymph nodes. The level 6 tissue is removed        from the specimen and thoroughly examined for lymph nodes. There are    multiple palpable lymph nodes. Approximately 12 possible lymph nodes are        identified and entirely submitted. The largest presumed lymph node measures     2.0 x 0.8 x 0.8 cm. It is bisected to reveal a cystic cavity filled with        thick white fluid. The thyroid is removed from the specimen and serially        sectioned to reveal a red-brown, gritty parenchyma with a mucoid surface.       There is a 0.1 cm firm, white nodule within the parenchyma approaching the      isthmus. There is no gross evidence of tumor. Representative sections of        the thyroid are submitted. The soft tissue on the posterior aspect of the       specimen is removed. The identified vein prior to inking is removed and the     remaining tissue is serially sectioned to reveal grossly normal muscle and      cartilage tissue. While sectioning the specimen, a lymph node is identified     that measures 2.0 x 1.1 x 0.2 cm. The remaining tissue on the possible  posterior larynx is thoroughly examined and one additional presumed  lymph      node is identified. The remaining tissue is grossly normal. Both lymph  nodes are entirely submitted. The piriform sinus is serially sectioned  while attached to the remaining specimen. The tumor is less than 0.1 cm to      the posterior margin, 0.1 cm from the superior margin, and 1.5 cm from the      inferior margin. The lesion is 2.0 cm thick. Representative sections of the     tumor and remaining specimen are submitted.

(D)LEFT HEMIMANDIBULECTOMY - A left hemimandibulectomy specimen ,the ramus
is 9.5 cm and the mandible is 9.3 cm. A 3.5 x 2.6 x 1.5 cm unremarkable
submandibular gland is present. An 11.0 x 6.0 cm ellipse of tan, hair-bearing
skin is present over the lateral aspect of the specimen. A 2.5 x 2.0 cm area
of bulging and ulceration is present in the center of the skin.
A 6.3 x 4.2 x 3.0 cm ulcerated tumor overlies the body of the mandible The
mucosal margins range ,from 0.3 cm to 2.0 CM. The anterior lateral and
posterior medial margins appear to comes to closest to the tumor and the tumor
is firm, tan, and focally necrotic and appears grossly to involve the cortical
bone. The tumor extends into the adjacent subcutaneous and dermal tissue of
the skin. Matted lymph nodesare present near the angle of the mandible.
These are grossly involved by partially necrotic tumor. A section of bone
will be submitted after decalcification.

"," Based on the pathology report, the following categories can be identified:

Site: The tumor is located in the hard palate and maxillary sinus, which are part of the upper aerodigestive tract.

Laterality: The tumor is present on the right side of the maxilla.

Histology: The tumor is a squamous cell carcinoma, which is a type of malignant epithelial tumor.

Stage: The tumor is at stage T4a N0 M0, indicating that it has grown into the surrounding tissues but has not yet spread to nearby lymph nodes or distant sites.

Grade: The grade of the tumor is not provided in the report.

Behavior: The behavior of the tumor is malignant, meaning that it is capable of invading and destroying surrounding tissues and spreading to other parts of the body.

Not provided: The information on the tumor's size, margins, lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion, or status of resection is not provided in the report.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Diagnosis:
Left neck tumor, paraganglioma
Discussion:
The tumor cells demonstrate diffuse strong immunoreactivity for synaptophysin and
chromogranin. S-100 highlights nerve fascicles and sustentacular cells. The histologic
features, in conjunction with the immunohistochemical findings, are consistent with a
paraganglioma.
Microscopic Description:
Microscopic examination reveals a paraganglioma . The tumor is characterized by nests
and small lobules of neoplastic cells with neuroendocrine features. The tumor cells
demonstrate round to oval nuclei with speckled chromatin and a moderate amount of
weakly eosinophilic cytoplasm. Overall, cytologic atypia appears mild. Only a rare
mitotic figure is seen. The nests of tumor are invested by hyalinized stroma. The
specimen includes a large ganglion with accompanying nerve fascicles. The tumor lies
adjacent to a network of vascular structures. Necrosis is not identified. The histologic
features appear most consistent with a paraganglioma.

COLLECTED: RECEIVED: ///7-//3 9fJ
GROSS DESCRIPTION: A) Received in formalin designated right tonsil is an irregular,
unoriented, 2.5 x 2 x up to 1.4 cm in thickness partially mucosa covered portion of multinodular
tan white focally firm soft tissue. One side of the specimen is white-tan, somewhat granular and
firm. It is probably covered by mucosa. The specimen is serially sectioned perpendicular to the
mucosal surface. On cut surface there is an ill-defined, pale tan-white, firm nodule 1.5 x 1.2 x 1.5
cm in greatest dimension. It grossly approaches the deep, inked margin. The specimen is entirely
submitted in cassettes Al-A3. B) Received unfixed designated right modified radical neck
dissection, double long = level II, double short = level IV is an 18 x 8 x 3 cm in greatest
dimensions right neck dissection specimen with surgical sutures designating levels II and IV.
The specimen is multinodular with multiple grossly positive lymph nodes in levels II and III
including a complex of matted nodes that involves both levels; one node is received cut across. A
10 x 3 x 1.5 cm portion of sternocleidomastoid muscle is identified on the anterior aspect of the
specimen. On the medial aspect of the muscle there is a suture-tied on both ends, 7 cm long x 0.5
cm in outer diameter vessel (internal jugular vein). Additional portion of a vessel 3 cm long is
present in level I lateral to the salivary gland tissue. The salivary gland in level I measures 5 x 3
x 1 cm and has a smooth tan-pink, lobulated, soft cut surface. The skeletal muscle adjacent to
grossly positive lymph nodes in the middle of the specimen, is not involved. The main complex
of positive nodes measures 7 cm in greatest dimension and as previously described crosses both
levels II and III. Cassette index: B 1 - representative section of salivary gland; B2 - level I four
probable nodes; B3 - level I one node bisected; B4 - level I one node bisected; B5 - level II
section of grossly positive node (2 cm) and three probable nodes; B6 - level II three nodes; B7 -
level II one probable node; B8 - representative cross section of matted nodes; B9 - level III
representative section of grossly involved necrotic node (2.2 cm); B 10 - level III three nodes;
B 11 - level III three probable nodes; B 12 - level III one node bisected; B 13 - level IV two nodes
one inked blue and bisected; B 14 - three probable nodes, level IV; B 15 - level IV three probable
nodes.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
A) Tonsil ,right, tonsillectomy: Moderately to poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, at
least 2 .2cm in greatest dimension (slide A2 ),extending to inked margin.
B) Lymph nodes ,right neck ,radical dissection:
1.Level I i. Submandibular gland with no evidence of metastatic carcinoma .ii.Six lymph nodes
with no evidence of metastatic carcinoma (0/6).
2. Levels II-III i. Matted lymph nodes positive for metastatic carcinoma spanning both levels. ii.
One (2cm )of eight level II nodes positive for metastatic (1/8). iii .One (2 .2cm) of eight level III
nodes positive for metastatic carcinoma (1/8).
3. Level IV i. Eight llymph nodes with no evidence of metastatic carcinoma (0/8).

a total laryngectomy with three tracheal rings and epiglottis, attached 
right selective neck dissection and left modified radical neck dissection, 
hyoid 
bone, and left thyroid lobe.  
In the left side of the larynx there is a 5.0 x 4.0 x 2.0 cm firm grey 
ulcerated mass, involving left glottis and extending superiorly to paraglottic 
space, invading left thyroid cartilage, and penetrating cricothyroidal

Review^'t !all"," Site: The samples were taken from various sites including the right anterior tonsillar pillar, retromolar trigone, right floor of mouth, ventral tongue, deep margin base of tongue, deep margin anterior, deep margin-deep tongue, level V lymph node, distal right hypoglossal, and submental triangle. Justification: The site is where the sample was taken, which is crucial in determining the origin and extent of the disease.

Laterality: Most of the samples were from the right side of the mouth and neck, with the exception of the level V lymph node and submental triangle, which are midline structures. Justification: Laterality is important in identifying any asymmetry or abnormalities that may suggest pathology.

Histology: The samples were described as red-tan tissue, with one sample of fatty tissue. However, the specific histologic diagnosis is not provided in this report. Justification: Histology is the study of the microscopic structure of tissues, which can reveal the type and nature of the disease present.

Stage: The stage of the disease is not provided in this report. Justification: Staging is a way to describe the extent of the disease, which is important in determining the prognosis and treatment plan.

Grade: The grade of the disease is not provided in this report. Justification: Grading is a way to describe the aggressiveness of the disease based on its microscopic features, which can help predict its behavior and response to treatment.

Behavior: The behavior of the disease is not provided in this report. Justification: The behavior of the disease refers to whether it is likely to grow and spread over time, which is important in determining the prognosis and treatment plan.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CASE: RECEIVED:
CLINICAL DATA: SCC of left mandibular mucosa. eyo?-/q// 5GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A)Received fresh designated ""..., left composite resection"" is a 4 AP x 2.5
ML x 2 SI cm portion of tissue that has been oriented by the surgeon with a
single stitch designated anterior and a double stitch designated lingual.
The lateral aspect of the specimen has bone. The specimen is covered by tan,
glistening mucosa with a central 2.5 x 1.5 cm ulcerated, ragged area. The
center of the lesion has been inked and tissue has been removed for research
studies. The lesion appears to be located approximately 0.5 cm from the
anterior margin and >0.5 cm from the posterior margin. The specimen is inked
as follows: Anterior - red; posterior - orange; mucosal and bony lateral
margin - green; bony and soft tissue deep margins - black; lingual/medial -
blue. The specimen is serially sectioned and the mass does not appear to
involve the red inked margin and it is located 0.3 cm from the orange margin.
The tumor appears to abut the blue inked and black inked margins and appears
to extend close to the bony green margin. Bone sections are decalcified.
80% of the specimen is submitted as follows: Al - mass, blue and black inked
margins; A2 - mass, orange, blue, and black inked margins; A3 - orange, blue,
and black inked margins and red inked margin; A4 - blue inked margins; A5 -
orange inked margin; A6 - blue inked margin; remaining sections submitted
following decalcification:A6- margins, green and orange; A7- orange inked
margin; A8-A9 green inked margin; A10- red inked margin.

G)Received in formalin labeled ""..., left neck contents"" is an 11.5 x 4.0 x
1.5 cm yellow, lobulated, focally glandular portion of fibrofatty tissue.
There is a single suture attached to the level I region, and a double suture
attached to the level III region. The level I region is sectioned, and there
is a 3.5 x 3.0 x 1.5 cm tan, lobulated salivary gland. It has tan, lobulated
cut surfaces, and no masses or lesions are identified. The adipose tissue attached to the salivary gland is sectioned and has fatty cut surfaces
containing a few lymph node candidates ranging from 0.2 to 1.0 cm. The
remaining adipose tissue in levels II and III are sectioned and have fatty
cut surfaces, and additional lymph nodes are identified ranging from 0.2 to
1.0 cm. Representative sections are submitted as follows: Gl - random
salivary gland; G2 - three individual lymph node candidates level I; G3 - one
bisected lymph node level I; G4 - three individual lymph node candidates

P^in,ar"," Site: The specimen is taken from the right tongue floor of the mouth.

Laterality: The tumor is located on the right side.

Histology: The specimen shows invasive squamous cell carcinoma.

Stage: The stage of the cancer is not provided, but it is reported that the depth of invasion is 0.55 cm.

Grade: The grade of the tumor is not provided in the report.

Behavior: Based on the histology and the fact that the tumor is invasive, the behavior of this lesion is likely to be malignant.

The reason for not providing the stage and grade is because they are not mentioned in the pathology report. The stage and grade of a cancer can provide important information about the extent of the disease and its prognosis, respectively. However, based on the information provided, it is clear that this is a significant finding of an invasive squamous cell carcinoma.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

submitted for frozen section consultation, and is resubmitted as B 1 C 1 FS. C) Received fresh for
frozen section consultation labeled "" "" and designated ""anterior margin"" is a 0.9 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm
mucosa soft tissue fragment. The specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section consultation
and is resubmitted as B 1 C 1 FS. D) Received fresh for frozen section consultation labeled "" "" and
designated ""posterior margin"" is a 0.4 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm tan-pink mucosa soft tissue fragment. The
specimen is inked blue and entirely submitted for frozen section consultation, and is resubmitted
as A 1 D 1 FS. E) Received fresh for frozen section consultation labeled "" "" and designated
""medial margin"" is a 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.1 cm tan-pink mucosa soft tissue fragment. The specimen is
entirely submitted for frozen section consultation and is resubmitted as E 1 FS (?). F) Received
fresh, labeled ""maxilla, right"", is a right composite resection specimen comprising posterior
maxilla-and palatal resection. The specimen is 6.7 cm from anterior to posterior, 4.3 cm from
medial to lateral, and 3.5 cm from superior to inferior. The anterior mucosal surface has two
teeth with silver metal fillings; one is 0.8 cm in greatest dimension, and the other is 1.3 cm in
greatest dimension. A 2.7 x 1.4 cm depressed, indurated lesion is immediately posterior to the
teeth. The lesion has a central 2.2 x 0.6 cm defect consistent with excision of tumor for research.
The edge of the lesion is tan-white, dusky, and edematous, and it has a rolled edge. The lesion
extends 0.3 cm from the nearest lateral mucosal margin, 0.5 cm from the nearest posterior
mucosal margin, and 1.1 cm from the nearest medial mucosal margin. The anterior mucosal
margin is 1.8 cm from the lesion. The remainder of the mucosal surface is tan-pink, smooth and
glistening. The underlying soft tissue margins consist of tan-yellow, lobulated adipose tissue and
maroon-brown possible muscle. No definite tumor is identified at the soft tissue surface. The
medial- superior aspect of the specimen has a 3.3 x 1.0 cm mucosal surface consistent with sinus
cavity; the sinus mucosa is tan-pink, smooth and glistening with areas that are red-brown,
roughened, and focally hemorrhagic. The specimen is inked as follows: anterior = red, medial
anterior = black, medial posterior = green, superior = yellow, lateral = orange and posterior =
blue. The specimen is serially sectioned from anterior to posterior to reveal a 5.2 x 4.1 x 3.5 cm,
tan-white, poly-lobulated, firm mass which immediately underlies the previously described
mucosal lesion. The mass appears to abut the posterior, superior, lateral, and medial soft tissue
margins. The mass abuts the posterior aspect of the most posterior tooth, and it does not appear
to extend any farther anteriorly. Representative sections are submitted as follows: Ft - medial
sinus soft tissue margin; F2, F3 - posterior soft tissue margins, perpendicular; F4-F6 - composite
cross section of mid posterior plane of the specimen; F7 - anterior bone margin, en face (decal);
F8-F 10 - composite cross section of mid anterior plane of the specimen (decal). G) Received
fresh for frozen section consultation labeled "" new deep margin"" is a 0.8 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm red-
brown soft tissue fragment. The specimen was entirely submitted for frozen section consultation
and is resubmitted as G 1 FS. H) Designated ""Right maxilla tumor and all first 5 margins and
normal tongue tissue to research"": No tissue received. Tissue submitted for research in OR per designation on pathology requisition form received in pathology, not examined in Pathology. I)
Received unfixed labeled "" new deep margin #2"" is 0.7 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm tan-white to maroon-
brown soft tissue fragment entirely submitted as 11. J) Received unfixed labeled "" level I, II, III
nodes"" is an 11.2 x 5 x 2.5 cm tan-pink fibrofatty soft tissue segment. Specimen is oriented as
follows: one suture level I, two sutures level II, and three sutures level III. Multiple lymph node
candidates are identified in each level. Level I contains a grossly positive 2.6 x 1.7 x 2.3 cm tan-
white lymph node as well as a 3.7 x 2.6 x 1.4 cm fragment of tan-white, lobulated tissue
consistent with possible salivary gland. Level II contains two grossly positive lymph nodes, the
larger is 3.7 x 2.3 x 2.2 cm and the smaller is 2.2 x 1.4 x 0.9 cm. No grossly positive lymph
nodes are identified within level III. Representative sections are submitted as follows: J 1 -
representative section of grossly positive level I lymph node; J2 - one candidate lymph node
bisected; J3 - four intact candidate lymph nodes (J 1-J3 are level I); J4 - representative section of
level I possible salivary gland tissue; J5, J6 - cross-section of larger grossly involved level II
lymph node; J7 - representative cross-section of smaller grossly involved level II lymph node; J8
- one level II candidate lymph node bisected; J9 - four intact level II candidate lymph nodes; J 10
- three level III intact candidate lymph nodes. K) Received in formalin labeled "" level V lymph
nodes"" is a 3.2 x 1.9 x 1.8 cm tan-pink fibrofatty soft tissue segment. Multiple candidate lymph
nodes ranging from 0.3 to 1.2 cm are identified. Representative sections are submitted as
follows: K1 - six intact candidate lymph nodes; K2 - six intact candidate lymph nodes; K3 - two
candidate lymph nodes, one intact uninked and one bisected and inked black; K4 - three intact
candidate lymph nodes. L) Received in formalin labeled "" level IV lymph nodes"" is a 2.2 x 2 x
0.6 cm tan-yellow, fibrofatty soft tissue segment. Multiple tan-pink, otherwise unremarkable
lymph node candidates are identified. No gross metastases are identified. Representative sections
are submitted as follows: L 1 - two intact candidate lymph nodes; L2 - four intact candidate
lymph nodes.

resection right floor of mouth"". It consists of a segment of mandible, with attached floor of mouth and bilateral neck 
dissections with overall measurements of 11.0 cm AP x 22.5 SI x 10.0 ML cm. The portion of right mandible measures 
6.0 cm AP x 2.5 cm SI x 3.0 cm ML. The lower alveolar ridge is edentulous. There is a tumor arising in the alveolar ridge. 
The tumor measures 5.5 AP x 7.0 SI x 4.7 ML cm. The tumor appears ulcerated and involves mandibular bone, floor of 
mouth and the adjacent right neck dissection, where it forms a large, partially necrotic mass, substantially replacing the 
right level I with extension into level II. The tumor involves the right parotid and right submandibular glands. The tumor is 
located at 0.1 cm from the closest right lateral soft tissue margin. The distance from the remaining margins to the tumor 
are as follows: anterior alveolar mucosa 1.0 cm, posterior alveolar mucosa 1.8 cm, right lateral alveolar mucosa 0.4 cm, 
anterior floor of mouth mucosa 0.8 cm, posterior floor of mouth mucosa 0.5 cm, medial floor of mouth mucosa 0.6 cm,

Page 4 of 4 "," Site: The specimens are from various locations, including the left lateral floor of mouth, right posterior tongue base, near total glossectomy, bilateral neck dissection, right and left submandibular glands, right and left level I-IV lymph nodes, right penfacial node, and surgical waste. The justification for this category is to describe the origin of each specimen.

Laterality: The laterality is provided for some of the specimens, indicating whether they are from the right, left, or bilateral locations. This information is important for determining the side of the body affected by the disease process.

Histology: The histology, or tissue type, is not explicitly provided in the descriptions. However, the use of terms such as ""tumor,"" ""lymph nodes,"" and ""submandibular gland"" suggest different histologic types. This information is crucial for making a definitive diagnosis.

Stage: The stage of the disease is not provided in the descriptions. Staging is a critical component of cancer diagnosis, as it helps determine the extent of the disease and appropriate treatment options.

Grade: Similarly, the grade of the tumors is not provided in the descriptions. Tumor grade refers to how abnormal the cells appear and how quickly they are likely to grow and spread. This information is essential for determining the aggressiveness of the tumor and developing an effective treatment plan.

Behavior: The behavior of the disease is not explicitly provided in the descriptions. However, the use of terms such as ""tumor"" and ""malignancy"" suggests that some of the specimens are from malignant neoplasms with the potential to invade surrounding tissues and metastasize.

Not provided: The following information is not provided in the descriptions:

* Some laterality information is missing for certain specimens.
* Histology, stage, and grade information are not provided for any of the specimens.
* Behavior information is not explicitly stated but can be inferred from some of the descriptions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I a 
Pa!je a of a "," Site: The tumor site is in the larynx, specifically in the supraglottic region. This was determined by the specimen type being a total laryngectomy and the tumor site being described as ""larynx, supraglottic.""

Laterality: Not provided. The report does not mention if the tumor is on the left or right side of the larynx.

Histology: The histologic type is squamous cell carcinoma, conventional. This was determined by the description of the tumor and the histologic grade given as G2.

Stage: The pathologic staging (pTNM) is pT4a. This indicates that the tumor has grown into nearby tissues, such as the thyroid or tongue muscles, and/or into the larynx's outer covering.

Grade: The histologic grade is G2, which means the cancer cells are moderately differentiated from normal cells. This was determined by the description of the tumor and the histologic grade given as G2.

Behavior: The behavior of this tumor is malignant, meaning it invades nearby tissues and can spread to other parts of the body. This is inherent in the definition of cancer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

iewed;"," Based on the incomplete pathology form provided, I can give the following summary:

1. Site: The primary tumor location is not explicitly mentioned, but it seems to be a solid tumor involving an organ (possibly gastrointestinal or genitourinary based on some of the lab data).
2. Laterality: Not provided.
3. Histology: The histological type of the tumor is also not explicitly stated, but there are references to various cell types and patterns such as squamous, glandular, round cells, fibroblasts, and others.
4. Stage: Based on the available lab data and diagnostic studies, it appears that the tumor has metastasized (pT3 N1 M1 stage). However, this information is incomplete and should be confirmed with additional clinical and pathological data.
5. Grade: The grade of the tumor is not provided, but there are references to nuclear appearance, mitotic activity, and cellular differentiation which could be used to determine the grade if more specific information were available.
6. Behavior: Given the presence of metastasis, this tumor is behaving aggressively (malignant).

It's important to note that a definitive diagnosis cannot be made with the provided incomplete form, and additional clinical and pathological data would be necessary for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

tongue"".
It consists of a 1.0 x 0.6 x 0.3 cm tan-red focally cauterized soft
tissue
evaluated intraoperatively. The remainder of frozen section tissue is
submitted labeled 5AFS.
Part 6 is labeled with the patient's name, initials XX and ""deep
margin"". It
consists of a 1.1 x 0.7 x 0.3 cm tan-pink cauterized soft tissue
evaluated
intraoperatively. The remainder of the frozen section tissue submitted
labeled 6AFS.
Part 7 is labeled with the patient's name, initials XX and ""right neck
dissection L 2-4"". It consists of an unoriented 14.0 x 5.0 x 1.3 cm
portion
of soft, yellow-pink, lobular, focally hemorrhagic and cauterized
fibroadipose
tissue. The specimen is arbitrarily divided into three equal portions
and on
dissection multiple ovoid and elongated, smooth, soft to moderately
firm, tan
to pink-red lymph nodes ranging 0.2 cm to 2.8 cm in greatest dimension
are
identified.
Section code:
7A- (1) bisected lymph node, one end of specimen
7B-C- intact lymph nodes from one end of specimen
7D- intact lymph nodes, mid aspect of specimen
7E- intact lymph nodes, opposing end

rectangular -shaped tissue that measures overall approximately 10.1 cm x 3.0 x  
1.1 cm. The tissue is unoriented and consists of tan, fatty tissue with  
multiple nodular fragments of tissue grossly consistent with lymph nodes.  The  
sternocleidomastoid and jugular vein are grossly inapparent.   Representativ e sections are submitted as follows:  
2A-2C  one end of tissue (with 2A containing four possible lymph nodes, 2B  
containing three possible lymph nodes, and 2C  
              containing multiple possible lymph nodes)  
2D and 2E mid portion of tissue, each con taining multiple possible lymph nodes  
2F-2H  opposing end portion of tissue (with 2F containing bisected lymph node  
and 2G containing two bisected lymph nodes, one  
              of which is inked blue, and 2H containing multiple possible  
lymph nodes).  
Part 3 is labeled with the patient' s name, initials, xx, MRN and as ""right  
neck, levels 2 through 4.""  Received in formalin is a single fragment of tan,  
fatty tissue that measures overall approximately 9.8 x 2.5 x 1.1 cm.  Upon  
serial sectioning, there are m ultiple nodular fragments of tissue grossly  
consistent with lymph nodes and no grossly apparent jugular vein or

Part 4 is received fresh labeled with the patient's name, initials xx and  
designated ""total larynx"".  The specimen consists of a larynx which measures  
8.1 cm from superior to inferior, 7.9 cm from left to right and 5.1 cm from  
anterior to posterior.   
A section of ulcerated lesion has been removed for tissue bank that measured  
2.1 x 1.7 cm and was supraglottic with transglottic extension to the left and  
right true vocal cords.  The area that has been banked is  inked in red.  The  
previously mentioned ulcerated lesion is red -brown in color, transglottic and  
appears to extend to the laryngeal surface of the epiglottis.  There is also a 0.3 x 0.2- cm ulcerated lesion on the false vocal cord and a 0.4 x 0.3 cm  
ulcerated lesion on the true vocal cord.  The lesion appears to extend to  
within 0.1 cm of the thyroid cartilage on both the left and right sides in the  
region of the glottis.  The area where the tumor extends is tan -yellow in  
color and firm in texture.  Near th e anterior commissure, the tumor extends  
superiorly through the pre -epiglottic space and extends to the pre- epiglottic  
soft tissue resection margin.
