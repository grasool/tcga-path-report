Parts C-F are received in formalin. \nPrimary surgery 2 of 4 \n Part A, additionally labeled \"omentum,\" consists of a section of red-tan, fibrofatty and firm tissue \nmeasuring \n13.0 x 13.0 x 2.0 cm. The specimen is studded with multiple yellow-tan to yellow-white nodules \nranging in \nsize from 0.2 cm up to 2.5 cm in greatest dimension. A 1.0 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm portion of the specimen is \ntaken for tumor banking, and representative sections are submitted in cassettes Al-A2. \nPart B, additionally labeled \"right ovary plus tube,\" consists of a partially cystic, partially solid structure \nwith no identifiable ovary and attached fallopian tube, which measures 11.0 x 9.0 x 4.0 cm and weighs \n238.2 gm. The cystic portion measures 4.0 cm in greatest dimension and has a cyst wall that ranges \nbetween 0.1 and 0.2 cm in greatest dimension, and has two exophytic papillary-like structures on the \nexternal surface, which measure 2.0 and 0.8 cm in greatest dimension, respectively. Deep to these, the \nspecimen is solid and has a fleshy, yellow-tan, irregular parenchyma. The solid portion measures 4.0 x 3.0 \nx 2.0 cm. The attached fallopian tube measures 3.5 cm in length x 0.4 cm in average diameter, is smooth, \npink-tan, and otherwise unremarkable. The external surface of the specimen is inked in black. A \nrepresentative section of the solid portion is SUbmitted as frozen section 1 with the remnant in cassette B1. \nThe remainder of the specimen is submitted as follows: \nCassette B2: Representative sections of fallopian tube. \nCassette B3: Representative sections of larger mass on exterior surface of cyst. \nCassette B4: Representative sections of smaller exophytic mass on external surface of cyst. \nCassettes B5-B6: Additional representative sections of cyst. \nCassettes B7-Bl0: Representative sections of solid portion of cyst. \nPart C, labeled \"uterus, cervix, left ovary and tube and rectosigmoid colon,\" consists of a uterus, attached \ncervix, fallopian tube and attached soft tissue tumor mass, and attached short segment of sigmoid colon. \nThe uterine specimen measures 7.5 cm from superior to inferior, 5.5 cm from cornu to cornu and 4.0 cm \nfrom anterior to posterior. The cervix measures 3.5 cm from side to side, 3.0 cm from anterior to posterior \nand approximately 2.0 cm in length. The serosal surface of the uterus is tan-brown, smooth and glistening, \nwith areas of subserosal hemorrhage scattered throughout. The cervical mucosa is tan-white, smooth and \nglistening, again with small areas of punctate mucosal and submucosal hemorrhage. The specimen probes \nto 6.5 cm and is opened along the lateral surfaces. The endocervical mucosa is pale tan and measures 1.0 \nmm in thickness. The endometrium is also pale tan, and free of polyps and masses. The endometrium \nmeasures 2.0 mm in thickness. The myometrium is serially sectioned, revealing no mural lesions. The \nmyometrium averages 1.3 cm in thickness. Two nodular masses of tissue are attached to the left surface of \nthe uterus. The serosal surfaces of both are similar, each with a very nodular contour, covered by a \ntan-brown serosa, and grossly obvious tumor nodules. Grossly, it is difficult to ascertain which of these \ntwo masses contains the ovary, however one does appear to be attached to the uterus by a tubular \nstructure, likely the fallopian tube. This portion of tissue measures 7.5 x 4.5 x 4.0 cm and the adjacent \ntubular structure measures 2.5 cm in length, with an average diameter of 1.0 cm. Serial sections through \nthe mass reveal no grossly obvious ovarian tissue, though a lumen filled with necrotic tissue is identified in \nthe previously-described tubular structure. The adjacent mass of tissue has a similar gross appearance \nand measures 5.5 x 4.5 x 3.5 cm. One portion of the specimen contains a thin-walled cyst filled with \ntranslucent fluid, measuring 3.0 cm in greatest diameter. On cut section, the specimen is composed of \nmultiple nodules of tan-white, firm tissue ranging in size between 0.5 and 2.0 cm. Adherent to the uterus \nand ovary is a segment of large bowel measuring 14.0 cm in length with an average diameter of 4.0 cm. \nThe serosal surface is diffusely caked with tumor nodules ranging in size between 0.2 and 0.5 cm, though \nwith confluence of tumor in other areas. What is thought to be the proximal margin is received stapled \nshut, with the distal margin remaining open. Upon opening, a scant, tan-brown mucoid material is \nidentified. The mucosa is pale tan, and unremarkable. Sections are submitted as follows: \nCassette C 1: Anterior cervix. \nCassette C2: Posterior cervix. \nCassette C3: Anterior endomyometrium. \nCassette C4: Posterior endomyometrium. \nCassettes C5-C6: Sections of putative ovary. \nPrimary surgery 3 of 4  Cassette C7: Putative fallopian tube. \nCassettes C8-C9: Mass adjacent to ovary. \nCassette CIO: Proximal bowel margin. \nCassette Cll: Distal bowel margin. \nCassette C12: Sections through unremarkable bowel mucosa. \nCassette C13: Representative sections of small bowel serosa. \nPart D, labeled\" rectum, staples proximal,\" consists of a single, short segment of rectum measuring 6.5 cm \nin length with an average diameter of 2.5 cm. Attached to the specimen is a large amount of very irregular \nand fragmented brown-tan, fibrous connective tissue measuring 8.5 cm in width x 4.0 x 2.5 cm. The \nsurrounding soft tissue is inked prior to opening of the staple surface at the proximal margin. The \nspecimen is opened to reveal pale tan-brown, glistening mucosa with no grossly identifiable masses or \nlesions. A section of the proximal margin is submitted in cassette D 1. A section of the distal margin is \nsubmitted in cassette D2. A random section is submitted in cassette D3. The attached fibrous connective \ntissue is serially sectioned, revealing a pericolonic mass of tan-white tumor measuring 3.0 x 2.5 x 2.0 cm. \nThe tumor mass approaches the proximal margin of resection within 1.0-2.0 mm, and the lateral margin of \nresection within 3.0 mm. A representative section is submitted in cassette D4. \nPart E, labeled \"transverse colon tumor,\" consists of an irregular and fragmentary tan-brown, polypoid \nmass measuring 3.4 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm. The specimen is serially sectioned, and representative sections are \nsubmitted in cassette E1. \nPart F, labeled \"small bowel mesentery,\" consists of a single ovoid nodule of yellow-tan, soft tissue \nmeasuring 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm. The specimen is entirely submitted in cassette F1. \nPart G, labeled \"bladder peritoneum,\" consists of an irregular and fragmentary tan-brown, polypoid mass \nmeasuring 3.4 x 1.8 x 1.0 cm.

The solid \nportion (8.5 x 6.6 x 4.0 \ncm) is soft, pink-tan with areas of apparent necrosis, and comprises approximately \n40% of the mass. The \ncystic portion of the mass is composed of multiple smooth walled cystic spaces \nwithout excresences. No \nresidual ovary is identified in the mass. The solid portion infiltrates through the distal \nportion of the \nrectum with invasion through the rectal wall, ulceration of the mucosa, and \npenetration into the lumen. \nThe proximal and distal margins of the colon/rectum are free of tumor. Tumor \napproaches to wthin 3.Scm \nfrom the distal margin (rectum) and to within 10 cm of the proximal margin \n(descending colon). The tumor \ncontains a cauterized surface near it's invasion into the rectum. The surgeon \nindicates the separate \nsegment of left ureter was present adjacent to this cauterized area. Additionally, \ntumor infiltrates into the \nposterior wall of the uterus with invasion into but not through the myometrial wall. \nThe uterine cavity \noverlying the area of tumor invasion appears grossly unremarkable. The tumor does \nnot appear to involve \nany other structures grossly. Two lymph nodes are found between the ovarian mass \nand the rectum. \nRepresentative sections of the solid component of the mass and sections of tumor  infiltrating rectum are \nsubmitted for frozen section diagnosis #1 with the frozen remnants in cassettes Al\u00ad\nA3. Additionally, \nportions of the mass as well as uninvolved endomyometrium are submitted for \nresearch. \nThe uterus additionally shows multiple nodules, sub-mucosal and sub-serosal, with \nfirm, white-tan cut \nsurfaces showing a whorled appearance. These nodules range in size from 0.7 to \n2.2cm in maximal \ndiameter and do not appear to be associated with the adnexal mass. No areas of \nhemorrhage, necrosis, or \ncystic degeneration are identified in these nodules. The ectocervix (1.0 x 1.0 cm) has \na smooth white-tan \nsurface without focal lesions. The cervical os is fish-mouthed and measures 0.7 cm in \ngreatest dimension. \nThe endocervix has glistening tan-brown mucosa and appears grossly unremarkable. \nThe endometrium is \nthin, tan-brown, and grossly appears atrophic. The right ovary is white-tan, \nmeasures 2.5 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm \nand shows no gross abnormalities. The right fallopian tube (4.5 cm length x 0.5 cm \ndiameter) appears \ngrossly unremarkable. The anatomic area of the left fallopian tube appears to consist \nentirely of infiltrating \ntumor and no residual fallopian tube is identified grossly. The separate portion of left \nureter is unoriented, \nappears intact, and shows no evidence of involvement by tumor. \nRepresentative sections are submitted as follows: \nCassettes Al-A3: Frozen section remnants. \nCassette A4: Cervix, anterior and posterior. \nCassette A5: Leiomyomata. \nCassette A6: Endomyometrium. \nCassette A7: Right ovary and right fallopian tube. \nCassette A8: Two regional lymph nodes. \nCassettes A9-A10: Cystic portion of mass. \nCassettes All-A12: Tumor near inked cyst wall. \nCassettes A13-A14: Distal colon margin, en face. \nCassettes A15-A16: Proximal colon margin, en face. \nCassettes A17-A18: Tumor infiltrating uterus. \nCassettes A19-A20: Bowel with tumor and cauterized area (inked) and cyst wall; \ninked margin in cassette \nA20. \nCassettes A21-A22: Cauterized inked margin and bowel. \nCassettes A23-A27: Representative sections of tumor under ovarian cyst. \nCassette A28: Large bowel tumor and margin (cauterized). \nCassettes A29-A30: Representative sections of large bowel tumor. \nCassette A31: Small colonic tumor. \nCassettes A32-A33: Extra colonic nodule. \nCassettes A34-A35: Representative sections of uninvolved bowel. \nCassette A36: Either end of left ureter. \nCassettes A37-39: Colon with left ovary. \nCassettes 40-42: Left ovary. \nPart B is additionally labeled \"2 -left pelvic lymph node,\" and consists of two  , \ntan-brown, irregularly shaped tissue fragments, the larger measuring 3.0 x 1.5 x 1.0 \ncm and the smaller \nmeasuring 2.0 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm. The specimen appears to consist of candidate nodes \nwith a small portion of \nPage 3 of 6 \nattached adipose tissue.

The remaining candidate nodes are submitted \nin cassette B2. \nPart C is additionally labeled \"1 -myoma,\" and consists of one unoriented, firm, \nwhite-tan, irregularly \nshaped tissue fragment measuring 4.5 x 4.0 x 2.5 cm and weighing 26.9 gm. The \nspecimen is inked blue. \nCross sectioning reveals white-tan tissue in a whorled pattern, consistent with \nleiomyoma. No areas of \nhemorrhage, necrosis or cystic degeneration are identified. Three representative \nsections are submitted in \ncassette C1. \nPart D is additionally labeled \"4 -right pelvic lymph node,\" and consists of three \nunoriented, rubbery, \ntan-brown, irregularly shaped tissue fragments, the largest measuring 2.5 x 2.0 x \n1.3 cm. The specimen \nmeasures 3.0 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm in aggregate. The largest fragment is bisected and \nsubmitted in cassette D1. \nThe two smaller fragments are submitted in cassette D2. \nPart E is additionally labeled \"6 -sigmoid donut,\" and consists of two unoriented \ndonut fragments of colon, \nthe larger measuring 2.5 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm and the smaller measuring 1.5 x 1.5 x 1.0 \ncm. Tissue is teased \naway from the staples, and sections of the larger fragment are submitted in cassette \nEl. Sections of the \nsmaller fragment ar.e submitted in cassette E1. \nPart F is additionally labeled \"5 -omentum,\" and consists of one unoriented soft, \nyellow-tan, irregularly \nshaped fragment of fatty and membranous tissue, measuring 9.0 x 4.0 x 1.0 cm. \nThe specimen is thinly \nsliced, revealing no nodules or other focal lesions. The specimen consists of \nunremarkable-appearing fatty \ntissue. Three representative sections are submitted in cassette Flo \nwere developed and their performance characteristics \nhave not been cleared or approved by the U. S. Food and \nI \nFDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These tests are used for clinical \npurposes. They should not \nbe regarded as investigational or for research. This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory \n~m\"ndrnents of \nncr/orm \n  \n \nResult of Her-2/neu test: This carcinoma is negative for Her-2/neu \noncoprotein overexpression. \nAn immunohistochemical assay was performed on block All using the CBll \nmonoclonal antibody to \nHer-2/neu oncoprotein. The staining intensity of this carcinoma was 0 on a scale of \n0-3 with focal \ncytoplasmic staining only. \nCarcinomas with staining intensity scores of a or 1 are considered negative for \noverexpression of Her-2/neu \noncoprotein. \nThose with a staining intensity score of 2 are considered borderline. We and others \nhave observed that \nmany carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 do not show gene amplification. \nAll carcinomas with \nstaining intensity scores of 2 are therefore submitted for FISH testing.

This tissue mass \nappears to comprise of some omental fat which is studded with multiple nodules of varying sizes. \nThe nodules appear to be confluent in some areas. The nodules range in size from 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm \nto 6.0 x 5.0 x 3.0 cm. These multiple nodules appear to have various consistencies. One of the large \nnodules is tan-white and firm; a section of this large firm nodule is submitted for frozen section. \nFROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS #1 \nOmentum, biopsy: tissue consistent with metastatic carcinoma of ovarian origin, with features of \nPage 2 of 4 \npapillary serous carcinoma. \nThe remainder of this frozen section specimen is subm entirely in cassette A1. \nIn addition to this large firm nodule (6.0 x 5.0 x 3.0 cm, frozen section obtained from middle of \nnodule), there are additional nodules which are slightly softer in consistency. Also present are some \nthin, fluid-filled cysts. These nodules are scattered throughout the omentum and are at the edges of \nthe resected specimen. Serial sectioning of all nodules reveal that most nodules are of the firm-white \nvariety with a few nodules being extremely soft and almost papillated on cut appearance. The thin, \nluid-filled areas when cut reveal cystic spaces filled with some clear serous fluid as well as some \npapillary regions.

A \nsmall piece of this tissue is submitted for frozen section diagnosis. \nFROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS #2 \nLeft biopsy: neoplasm, favor malignant, final diagnosis deferred. \nThe remainder of the frozen section tissue is submitted entirely in cassette B1. An additional \nrepresentative section is submitted in cassette B2. \nPart C, additionally labeled \"right ovary and tube\" consists of a large mass of soft, irregularly-shaped \nbosselated tissue measuring 7.0 x 7.0 x 3.5 cm In greatest dimension. Protruding along one edge of \nthis mass of tissue appears to be a fallopian tube which is slightly dilated in portions, especially more \ndistal. The fimbriated ends of the this fallopian tube are slightly blunted. A small, white, firm \nstructure, possibly representing an ovary is noted on the surface of this mass and measures \napproximately 2.0 x 1.0 x 0.8 cm. This mass is bisected to reveal an ovary which has been largely \nreplaced by this large soft, bosselated lesion. The remaining ovarian tissue appears to be grossly \nunremarkable. This papillary process involves the entire ovary, however, no definite ovarian source \nf origin is grossly identified.

There are multiple papillated masses on the surface. A portion of fallopian tube is identified which \nmeasures 6 cm in length and 1 cm in greatest diameter. Serial sectioning reveals that the nearly the \nentire \novarian mass consists of tan-pink, soft, friable, papillary structure. Cassette Ai contains a frozen section \nremnant. Representative sections of the mass are submitted in cassettes A2-A6. \nPart B, labeled \"right ovary\", consists of an ovary with a portion of fallopian tube weighing 83. 5 grams \nand \nmeasuring 7 x 6 x 4.8 cm. The fallopian tube measures 7 cm in length and 2 cm in greatest diameter at \nthe \nportion of hydrosalpinx. A large cyst is associated with the ovary measuring 6.5 cm in greatest diameter \nand containing clear serous flUid. The external surfaces are inked in black. The internal surface of the cyst \ncavity is smooth. A 1.3 cm nodular area beneath the cyst wall is visible in the region of the adherence of \nthe \nfimbriae to the ovary. Sections through this region reveals a mass which is contiguous with the internal \nsurface of the fallopian tube obstructing the distal orifice. This mass measures 1.7 cm in greatest \ndiameter. \nA section of this area is submitted in cassette B1. Two irregularly-shaped white fibrous-appearing areas \nare \nalso beneath the internal cyst wall; each measuring <1.5 cm in greatest diameter.

The patient undergoes exploratory laparotomy, total abdominal \nhysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy, appendectomy, tumor debulking and \nrectosigmoid resection with a primary anastomosis. \nGross Description \nThe specimen is received fresh in thirteen parts, each labeled with the patient's name and medical record \nnumber. \nPart A is additionally labeled \"omentum.\" It consists of a single fragment of omentum, measuring 22 x 18 \nx \n3 cm. The omentum is studded with multiple white-pink nodules, ranging in size from 0.2 cm to 5.0 cm. A \nrepresentative section is submitted for frozen section diagnosis as FS1, with the frozen section remnant \nsubmitted in cassette A1. An additional representative section is submitted in cassette A2. \nPart B is additionally labeled \"uterus, cervix, ovaries and tubes plus tumor.\" It consists of a single \nhysterectomy specimen weighing 800 grams and measuring 14 cmfrom fundus to cervix, 4.5 cm from \ncornu to cornu and 9.0 cm from anterior to posterior. The cervical portion of the specimen measures 3 cm \nin length and 2 cm in diameter. The uterus is distorted by multiple firm, white-tan, whorled leiomyomata \nranging in size from 0.3-5.5 cm in average diameter. No necrosis or hemorrhage is identified in any of the \nleiomyomata. The endometrium is tan-pink and measures 0.2 cm in average thickness. The myometrium \nis distorted by the multiple leiomyomata and therefore ranges in thickness from 1.0-2.7 cm in thickness. \nThe uterus is oriented by the peritoneal reflections. Within the left adnexa, there is a 2.5 x 1.5 x 1.3-cm \nfirm, white nodule which may represent ovarian tissue. There is an additional firm, white-yellow, solid \nregion measuring 2.5 x 1. 7 x 1.0 cm which may represent tumor within the adnexa. A small segment of \nfallopian tube is identified measuring approximately 3 cm in length and 0.8 cm in average diameter. There \nare additional small, white, firm nodules which apparently represent tumor studding the adnexal tissue. \nThese nodules obscure the normal anatomy and make orientation difficult. The right adnexa contains a \nfirm, white region measuring 3.0 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm which may represent ovarian tissue. A portion of fallopian \ntube measuring approximately 4 cm in length and 0.7 cm in average diameter is present. Again, multiple \nfirm, white regions, possibly representing tumor are present within the adnexa precluding exact \nidentification of the normal anatomy. A representative section of the specimen is submitted for frozen \nsection analysis as frozen section #2, with the remnant submitted in cassette B1. Within the specimen \ncontainer, there are multiple unoriented fragments of firm, white-tan tissue representing tumor measuring \n13.5 x 13 x 4 cm in aggregate.

Adherent to the serosal surface is mesenteric fat, \nmeasuring \n10.5 x 9.0 x 3.0 cm, which is studded with abundant firm, white nodules, ranging in size from 0.2 cm to \n2.5 cm. The largest of these nodules abuts the radial surface of the colon. However, it does not appear to \ninvade the muscular wall nor the mucosa. The pericolonic fat is extensively studded with tumor, and \ntherefore, an adequate lymph node dissection cannot be performed. The specimen was received with \nstaple \nlines at each colonic resection margin. One end is inked in blue and the opposite inked in black for \nmicroscopic evaluation (no orientation was provided). A representative section of tumor is taken for \nOncotech analysis.

Representative sections are submitted in cassette H1. \nPart I, additionally labeled \"appendix,\" consists of a 4 cm in length x 0.6 cm in average diameter appendix \nwith attached yellow-brown mesoappendix. The serosal surface of the appendix is brown and glistening. \nAt the tip of the appendix, a white-brown, cirrhotic lesion is present, measuring 1.8 x 1.2 x 1 cm, \ninvolving \nthe tip of the appendix. The tip of the appendix, including the transition into the white, cirrhotic lesion, is \nsubmitted in cassettes 11-12. Representative cross-sections of the appendix and mesoappendix are \nsubmitted in cassette 13. \nPart J, additionally labeled \"small bowel mesenteric,\" consists of multiple, unoriented, white-tan tissue \nfragments measuring 1 x 1 x 0.5 cm in aggregate.

Abundant mitotic figures and apoptotic cells are seen, The findings are most likely those of \na high-grade serous carcinoma, and the large cell size with eosinophilic cytoplasm suggests the \noxyphilic variant thereof. However, the differential diagnosis can include oxyphilic variants of clear \ncell carcinoma or a high-grade endometrioid adenocarCinoma. The absence of extra-ovarian tumor \ngiven the size of the primary is also rather unusual for serous carcinoma. Serous carcinoma is \nnonetheless favored as the overall growth pattern is most consistent with this diagnosis, and areas \nwith well-developed features of either clear cell or endometrioid adenocarcinoma are not seen. \nAdditional stains were necessary to properly assess this case, and these were performed and \nevaluated with the following results: \n-WTl: Positive. \n-p53: Positive, variable intensity. \n-ER: Negative. \n-PR: Focal, patchy positive, \n-CA125: Positive. \nThe expression of WTl is most consistent with an ovarian serous carcinoma, which is also supported \nby the diffuse expression of p53 and CA125, and low-level or absent expression of PR and ER \nrespectively. Although p53 staining is diffuse, the intenSity varies more than is typical of serous \ncarcinoma. Nonetheless, the diagnosis is not excluded by this pattern. In contrast, expression of \n\u2022 'ITl and diffuse p53 argues against clear cell carcinoma, and while some PAS-positive material is \n:esent, this is diastase-resistant and therefore not compatible with glycogen. At least some of the \nmaterial is mucin and stains with mucicarmine. The expression of WTl and poor expression of ER  and PR also argue against endometrioid adenocarcinoma. \nOvarian Tumor Synoptic Comment \n1. Type of tumor: Serous carcinoma. \n2.

The external surface of the ovary \nand tube is predominantly smooth, except for a vague, ill-defined, approximately 3 cm area on the \novarian surface which is slightly irregular in texture. This area is inked in blue, and the remaining \nsurface is inked in black. Although irregular, no overt papillary excrescences are seen. In addition, \nthe fallopian tube resection margin is inked in green. The fallopian tube appears unremarkable, and \nno discrete lesions are seen or palpated, and the fimbriae are lush. The ovary is sectioned to reveal \na soft, fleshy, gray-white, almost-solid interior with an irregular, up-to-6 cm apparently necrotic \ncavity in the middle. The tumor is soft and has a grossly discernible papillary appearance. There is  also a single smooth-walled, 4 cm, unilocular cyst filled with a clear, yellow-brown fluid as well as an \nadjacent 2.4 cm, unilocular, hemorrhagic cyst. This latter cyst directly underlies the blue-inked area \nand contains multiple small papillary excrescences along the wall as well as a 1.5 cm, solid area with \na consistency similar to the rest of the bulk tumor. The fallopian tube is sectioned and appears \ngrossly unremarkable.

Gross photographs are taken. The external surface of the \novary is noted to be smooth, tan-white-gray and shiny. No surface adheSions, solid tumor or \npapillary growth, or implants are noted. The tumor capsule is intact. Upon sectioning, the cut \nsurface of this nodule appears to be yellow-orange. Sectioning of the tumor reveals 70% solid \ngrowth with 30% cystic area. The cystic area is multiloculated and contains yellow serous fluid. The \nsolid portion of the ovary is yellow, lobulated, firm, with punctate areas of hemorrhage. The cystic \nrea is also noted to contain some areas of hemorrhage. The interior of the cyst is noted to contain \npapillary excrescences. A portion of the specimen is submitted for frozen section diagnosis 1, with \nthe remnant submitted in cassette A14. The attached fallopian tube and fimbriae appear grossly \n unremarkable. However, a small, white-tan nodule measuring 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm is visible on the \nsurface of the mesosalpinx. An additional nodule measuring 0.4 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm is palpable within the \nmesosalpinx.

This type of cancer is commonly associated with ovarian and fallopian tube tumors.\n\nStage: The extent of the disease suggests a late-stage presentation, as there are metastatic lesions found in various anatomical locations, including lymph nodes, soft tissues, and abdominal organs. However, a formal staging classification is not provided in this report.\n\nGrade: The grade of the tumor is consistently reported as high grade, indicating aggressive behavior and poor differentiation.\n\nBehavior: The behavior of the tumor is malignant, with metastatic lesions found in multiple anatomical locations."

The report describes gross examination of various specimens from different sites in the patient's body.\n\nLaterality: Right (right pelvic tumor, right diaphragmatic tumor, right hemidiaphragm), Left (left peritoneal tumor), Bilateral (bilateral adnexae), and not provided for most other sites. The laterality is mentioned in the site description.\n\nHistology: Not all specimens are described in terms of histology, but high-grade adenocarcinoma is mentioned in one specimen. Adenocarcinoma is a type of cancer that starts in glandular cells and can be high or low grade depending on how abnormal the cells look under a microscope.\n\nStage: Not provided in the report. Staging of cancer requires information about the size of the tumor, whether it has spread to nearby lymph nodes, and whether it has metastasized to distant organs, which is not available in this gross examination report.\n\nGrade: High grade is mentioned in one specimen. The grade of a tumor refers to how abnormal the cells look under a microscope and can help predict how likely the cancer is to grow and spread.\n\nBehavior: Not provided in the report. Behavior refers to whether the tumor is malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous). In this report, most specimens are described as tumors, which suggests that they are likely to be malignant, but confirmation of malignancy requires microscopic examination and other diagnostic tests.\n\nIn summary, the gross examination report provides information on the site, laterality, histology (in part), grade (in part), and behavior (not provided) of various specimens from different parts of the patient's body. However, more detailed information is needed to determine the stage and confirm the behavior of the tumors."

Most of the \ngrossly evident tumor in the left adnexa appeared to be paratubal, \nrather than intratubal. Although this high-grade papillary serous \ncarcinoma extensively involves the left para tubal soft tissues/ \n/ligaments, serosal surface of the left fallopian tube, focally \ninvolves the muscular wall of the left fallopian tube and is present \nwithin the lumen and focally involves the mucosa of the fimbriated \nend of the left fallopian tube, a peritoneal primary carcinoma \nrather than a primary tubal carcinoma is favored. The tumor \nexhibits features of high-grade serous carcinoma, for the most \npart, and focallY pseudotransitional features. Growth patterns \nof tumor include papillary, glandular and solid. Tumor-associated \npsammoma bodies are present in many of the involved sites. Lympho\u00ad\nvascular invasion by tumor is present in most of the involved \nsites. Foci of tumor necrosis are present. Secondary acute and \nchronic inflammatory changes, reactive stromal changes, fibrosis, \nadhesions, and secondary reactive mesothelial proliferation are \npresent in'most of the involved sites. No metastatic tumor is \nidentified in the sampled lymph nodes. The lymph nodes do sho,\"} \nreactive lymphoid proliferation, sinus histiocytosis, foci of \nfibrosis and/or calcifications. \n=============================================================c====== \nHISTORY: Pelvic mass \nHICROSCOPIC: \nSee Diagnosis.

The \ncervical portion of the uterus is about 2.0 cm long and up to 3.5 cm in diameter. The endometrial cavity is \nabout 3.0 cm long and up to 1.5 cm in width. The endometrial mucosa has a maximum thickness of 0.1 \ncm. The muscular uterine wall has a maximum thickness of about 1.5 cm. Attached to the cervix there is \na cuff of vaginal tissue lined by tan mucosa that is up to 2.0 cm in length posteriorly, and up to O.S cm in \nlength, anteriorly. The laterality of the adnexal structures Is uncertain. The larger of the two ovaries is \n4.S x 2.S x 2.4 cm. The ipsilateral fallopian tube has fimbria at one end, is about S.O cm in length and up \nto 0.5 cm in diameter. The adjacent adnexal soft tissues measure up to about 3.0 cm in width. The \nsmaller ovary is about 2.0 x 1.S x 1.2 cm. The second fimbriated fallopian tube is 4.5 cm long and ranges \nfrom about 0.3 to 0.6 cm in diameter. \nThere are multiple semi-soft to firm tan tumor nodules involving the serosal surface of the smaller ovary \nand focally invading the cortex of the smaller ovary. These tumor deposits measure up to O.S cm in \ndiameter. There are also plaque-like and nodular aggregates of semi-soft to firm tan tumor involving tile \nadnexal soft tissues, bilaterally and the serosal surfaces of both fallopian tubes. There are friable tan \ntumor deposits amounting in aggregate to about 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm involving the parauterine soft tissues. \nNo gross tumor is seen in the uterus, including the cervical portion of the uterus, or vaginal cuff. \nThe larger ovary appears to be subtotally replaced by a moslly cystic and focally solid tumor that is about \n4.S cm in maximum dimension. The cystic neoplasm in the larger ovary is multiloculated and contains \nyellow fluid. The linings are tan-white and smooth, for the most part. There is some tan-white fibrous \ntissue in the cyst wall. The smaller ovary also shows multiple tiny to small cysts, ranging from less than \n0.1 to about O.B cm in diameter. There appears to be some concentration of cysls with some intervening \nwhite fibrous tissue over an area measuring about 1.0 em in diameter in the smaller ovary. Adhesions \ninvolving the adnexal structures and focally involving the serosa of the uterus are also noted. No gross \npathologic lesions of the endometrium or myometrium are seen.

        "llm_output": " Site: Omentum and Right Breast\nThe presence of a tumor in the omentum indicates a primary site of omental cancer, while the location of the tumor in the right breast is provided in the pathology report.\n\nLaterality: Right\nThe laterality is specified as right for the breast tumor. The absence of information about the laterality of the omental tumor can be interpreted as not provided or unknown.\n\nHistology: Ductal Adenocarcinoma and Not Specified\nThe histologic classification of the invasive tumor in the breast is ductal adenocarcinoma, while the type of cancer in the omentum is not specified but can be inferred as some form of metastatic carcinoma.\n\nStage: IIIC and Stage I\nThe primary omental tumor is classified as stage IIIC (T3c/N0/M0) based on the TNM staging system, while the breast tumor is classified as stage I (T1b pNO/ MO). The overall AJCC stage for each cancer may differ due to differences in their respective stages.\n\nGrade: III and G3\nThe Page & Anderson grade of the invasive tumor in the breast is III, while the Broders' grade is G3, both indicating poorly-differentiated carcinoma. The grade of the omental tumor is not specified but can be assumed to have a similar grade based on its advanced stage.\n\nBehavior: Malignant for Both\nBoth tumors are malignant in behavior, as indicated by their classification as carcinomas and their respective stages."
