Extending from the renal pelvis is a ureter (8 x 0.5 cm) renal artery measuring 7x\n0.5 cm, and rend vein measuring 0.5 x 1 cm. The renal vein is free of gross abnormality at the margin. The specimen\nis received with a surface disruption at the inferior pole and at the lateral aspect of the kidney measuring 6 cm in\ngreatest dimension through which friable necrotic debris extrudes. The adjacent fat is marked with black ink. In the\nmid lower pole and corresponding to the capsular disruption is a well circumscribed predominantly necrotic mass\nmeasuring 15 x 10 x 9 cm. The mass lies 1 cm from the renal vein margin and grossly extends through the renal Page 2 of 2\ncapsule and perirenal fat at the capsular disruption site. The remainder of the renal cortex is tan-brown with a well\ndefined corticomedullaryjunction. The pelvis and calyces are covered by smooth glistenin mucosa .The adipose\ntissue is thinly sectioned, and no lymph nodes are found .The case is reviewed by , Representative sections\nof the specimen are submitted as follows :Al) renal vein, artery and ureter margins en face ;A2-3) capsular\ndisruption two fragments per cassette ;A4-8) capsule wall, two fragments per cassette ;A9) non- neoplastic kidney;\nAl 0) perinephritic fat.\nAt the request oM the specimen is regrossed with additional sections of the perlhilar blood vessels\nsubmitted in cassettes Al 1-A15 under the direction ot^ ^s\nMICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:\nSections of vascular and ureteral margin tissues do not show a neoplasm .Sections of the grossly described\nlesion show a necrotic papillary carcinoma with patchy hemosiderin, and areas of variably foamy cytoplasm.

Right kidney mass: In formalin labeled \"right kidney mass\" is a 15 x 7.5 x 6.5 cm kidney with abundant attached\nperinephric fat weight 1,721 grams in aggregate. There is 3.5 cm ureter extending from the renal hilum. The kidney is\nbivalved to reveal an ill defined 8.5 cm in greatest dimension variegated tan-white to red nodular tumor within the\nsuperior pole. On cut section, the tumor grossly appears to possibly extend into the perinephric fat at the superior pole.\nThe lining of the renal pelvis is grey-white and slightly bosselated. Upon sectioning it appears that the tumor elevates\nthe urothelium and It is unclear at gross dissection whether the tumor penetrates through the urothelium into the renal\npelvis. The tumor also grossly extends into the renal artery, lying 5mm from the renal artery resection margin. The\nremaining renal parenchyma is pale tan-pink with an ill defined corticomedullary junction. There is a small portion of\nadrenal gland at the most superior aspect of the specimen with an orange red out surface. The gland grossly does not\nappear to be involved by tumor. The perinephric fat is inked black. Representative sections are submitted in eight\ncassettes as labeled: A vascular and ureter margins, B tumor to include perinephric fat, C-D tumor to include renal\npelvis, E tumor to include renal artery, F tumor to include uninvolved renal parenchyma, G normal renal parenchyma, H\nadrenal gland.\n2. Peri-caval node. In formalin labeled \"peri-caval node\" are two nodular tan-pink tissues which measure 3.5 x 3 x 2.3 cm\n3.and 2.5 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm. The larger tissue Is inked blue and the smaller tissue is inked black. Sectioning of the larger\ntissue reveals a slightly friable and partially cystic tan-pink cut surface containing coagulated blood. Sectioning of the\nsmaller tissue reveals a partially cystic red-brown cut surface containing coagulated blood. Representative sections are\nsubmited in 4 cassettes as follows: A-B entire smaller tissue ,C-D larger tissue.\nGallbladder :In formalin labeled \"gallbladder\" is a 9.5 x 5 x 2.8 cm intact gallbladder. The serosa is tan-pink and dull.\nThe cystic duct is 0.3 cm in diameter and patent .The gallbladder wall averages 0.2 cm in thickness. The mucosa is\nvelvety yellow-red with diffuse yellow stippling within the body. The lumen contains tan-yellow viscous bile and a 2.5 cm\ngreen -black granu,tar cholelith.

Trimmed of fat the kidney is 133 gm, 9.3 x 5.8 x 3.8 cm. Arising from the \nrenal pelvis is a 7.8 cm in length and 0.6 em in diameter segment of ureter, a 2.2 cm in length and 1 em in \ndiameter segment of renal artery, and a 1.2 cm in length and 0.8 cm in diameter segment of renal vein. No \nlymph nodes are identified in the renal pelvis and no adrenal gland tissue is identified within the perirenal \nfat. The kidney is purple-brown with a faint lobulated appearance. On the inferior pole there is a 3.5 em in \ndiameter spherical nodule with a yellow-tan coloration. In this area the capsule is inked black. The cut \nsurface identifies a 5.5 x 3.5 x 3.5 cm mottled yellow-tan tumor mass with focal areas of hemorrhagic \nnecrosis and white fibrous areas up to 1.2 cm in maximum diameter. In addition, there are cystic structures \nfrom 0.1 to 1 cm in diameter. Grossly, the tumor mass extends to the renal capsule but does not penetrate \nthe capsule. In addition, the tumor extends into the vein ofthe renal pelvis. The remaining renal \nparenchyma is red-brown. The surface of the cortex exhibits broad-based scars up to 1.6 cm in diameter. \nIn addition, there are renal retention cysts from 0.2 to 0.8 cm. The renal cortex averages 0.5 cm in \nthickness and the medulla averages 1.2 cm. No other masses or indurated areas are grossly identified. \nSummary of sections: 1 -surgical margins of the ureter, renal artery and renal vein, 2-4 -tumor mass and \nrenal capsule, 5-6 -tumor mass and renal pelvis, 7 -representative section of renal parenchyma with scar, \n8 -representative section of renal parenchyma with renal retention cysts, 9-11 tumor within segmental \nbranches of renal vein. \nMicroscopic Description \nMicroscopic examination has been performed on all slides.

It consists of a nephrectomy specimen\nwhich together with perinephric fat weighs 446 grams. It measures 17.5 cm from superior to inferior, 9 cm\nfrom medial to lateral, and 4.5 cm from anterior to posterior. Along the medial-superior edge of the\nperinephric fat there is a intact appearing 6.5 x 3.5 x 1 cm portion of adrenal gland. Along the anterior\nsurface of the kidney there Is a thin delicate membranous tissue consistent with Gerota 's fascia\napproximately measuring 10 x 5 cm. The central-lateral surface of the nephrectomy specimen is torn and\ndisrupted exposing the cortical surface of the kidney which Is bulging .Serial sections of the adrenal gland\nreveal no gross evidence of tumor involvement. At the hilum of the kidney the renal artery and renal vein\nare identified. The vessels are opened and there is no gross evidence of intraluminal tumor. Extending\nfrom the hilum of the kidney is a small caliber portion of ureter which is 6.5 cm in length and 0.3 cm In\ndiameter. The ureter is opened to the renal pelvis to reveal the urothelium Is tan-white and smooth and\nunremarkable. Sectioning through the central-lateral surface of the kidney reveals a well circumscribed\ngolden yellow and thinly capsulated appearing neoplasm which overall measures 3.3 x 3.2 x 2.8 cm. This\nneoplasm abuts the cortical surface of the kidney but grossly does not appear to extend through the renal\ncapsule Into the small amount of adherent perirenal adipose tissue .The neoplasm Is 3.5 cm from the\nhilum and hilar vascuiature. There is some cautery and cavitation of the renal parenchyma just along the\nsuperior edge of the tumor suggestive of surgical manipulation .There is some hemorrhage extending\ninto the hilar fat. The kidney away from the neoplasm has a normal reddish brown appearance and the\ncortical medullary junction appears distinct. The cortical thickness is 0.7 cm. Close sectioning of the\nremainder of the kidney reveals no additional masses. The perinephric adipose tissue is dissected but no\nlymph nodes are identified grossly. Also in the specimen container is an additional 7.5 cm aggregate of\nlobulated fatty tissue which is serially sectioned and palpably unremarkable. Representative sections of\nthe tumor are obtained for research purposes. Following fixation the sections are submitted as\nsummarized below: Section summary: Al) surgical margin, renal artery, renal vein and ureter, A2)\nadrenal gland, A3) additional sections of ureter and ureteral pelvic junction, A4) Gerota's fascia, A5-A7)\nsections of central-lateral tumor and cortical surface of kidney, A7-A8) sections of tumor and immediately\nadjacent renal tissue.

It consists of a \nnephrectomy specimen with adherent long segment of ureter which weighs   The nephrectomy \nspecimen measures 14 cm from superior to inferior, 7.5 cm from medial to lateral, and 5 cm from anterior \nto posterior. There is no grossly identifiable adrenal gland tissue. Along the anterior surface of the kidney \nis a 8 x 5.5 cm area of thin delicate adherent tissue suggestive of Gerota's fascia. At the hilum the renal \nartery and renal vein are identified. The vessels are opened and show no gross evidence of intraluminal \ntumor. Extending from the hilum of the kidney is a 26 cm segment of ureter which proximally and \ncentrally has a diameter of 0.5 cm, up to 0.6 cm at the distal end. A yellow plastic stent is present in the \nlumen of the ureter. The ureter is opened and the urothelium is tan and smooth. At the pelvis friable \ntumor is present in the renal pelvis arising from the central calix. The kidney is bivalved to reveal a finely \ngranular tan-white neoplasm occupying the superior pole calix and extending into the middle pole calix. \nThis neoplasm overall measures 3.7 x 3.2 x 3.2 cm. It is approximately 1 cm from Gerota's fascia and 1.5 \ncm from the renal hilar vascular margin. It involves the upper pole and central pole calices. The inferior \npole calix appears uninvolved. The renal parenchyma is otherwise reddish brown and cortical thickness is \n0.6 cm. There are no obvious lymph nodes in the perinephric adipose tissue. Representative sections are \nsubmitted.

It consists of a nephrectomy specimen\nwhich together perinephric fat weighs 627 grams. It measures 20 cm from superior to inferior, 10 cm from\nmedial to lateral, and 9 cm from anterior to. posterior. Along the anterior surface there is lobulated fatty\ntissue and there is a bulging fluctuant mass at the inferior pole of the kidney. At the hilum the renal artery\nand renal vein are identified. The vessels are opened and show no gross evidence of intraluminal tumor.\nExtending from the hilum of the kidney there is an 8 cm segment of ureter which appears somewhat\nattenuated. The ureter is opened to reveal smooth tan-white urothelium. The kidney is bivalved to reveal\na fluid filled cystic mass in the inferior pole which bulges anteriorly this cystic mass measures 6 x 8 x 52\ncm. It contains amorphous brown material and turbid fluid. The lining of the cyst Is brown with patchy\nsmall areas of yellow discoloration. The cyst is 1.3 cm from the hitum of the kidney. It appears contained\nwithin the renal capsule and is separated from the anterior surface of the kidney by a thin layer of smooth\nfascial tissue. Representative sections of the mass are obtained for research purposes. The remaining\nkidney has pale red parenchyma and normal appearing medullary rays. Cortical thickness is 0.8 cm. There\nare scattered fluid filled cysts within the cortical portion of the kidney which are up to 1.3 cm. No other\ndiscrete masses are present. Serial sections of the perineural adipose tissue reveal no grossly obvious\nlymph nodes and no identifiable adrenal tissue. Representative sections are submitted.\nSection summary:\nAl) surgical margin, renal artery, renal vein and ureter,\nA2) additional sections of ureter and ureteral pelvic junction,\nA3) anterior surface of lower pole kidney including possible Gerota's fascia,\nA4-A6) additional representative sections of cyst,\nA7) cyst and closest approach to hilum,\nAB) uninvolved kidney.\nMicroscopic Description:\nMicroscopic sections have been examined.

The tumor is\ncharacterized by multinodular growth and tumor cells with\nmoderately pleomorphic medium to large oval nuclei with\noccasional nuclear grooves and ample eosinophilic to\nvacuolated cytoplasm. In areas the papillary formations are\ndensely packed'and essentially solid. There is multifocal\nintratumoral hemosiderin and formation of cystic nodules\nfilled with papillary tumor and blood. Tumor abuts the\nfibrous renal capsule, but does not clearly invade perirenal\nfat on multiple levels examined. There is invasion of small\nnon-muscularized veins in the renal sinus but no definitive\ninvasion of the renal sinus fat or large branches of the\nrenal vein.\nThe tumor is associated with a significant and extensive\ndiffuse and nodular lymphocytic infiltrate at the periphery\nof the lesion that also extensively involve perinephric and\nrenal sinus fat, and show sheets and nodules of cells\nextensively involve the remaining non-carcinomatous renal\ncortex. These are monomorphic-appearing small lymphocytes,\nand by immunohistochemistry are diffusely positive for CD20\nand BCL-2. The same B cells are negative for CD5 and CD23,\nwhich highlights residual germinal center dendritic cells.\nCD3 and CD5 show staining in a smaller population of T\nlymphocytes. BCL-6 and cyclin D1 are negative.\nSections of the omental nodule show a spherical accessory\nspleen with relatively normal splenic architecture and small\nperiarterial lymphoid nodules. The adipose tissue\nsurrounding the splenule is involved by dense sheets and\nnodules of the same lymphoid infiltrate with identical immunophenotype to the kidney. Thel eft pelvic lymph node\nshows involvement by both metastatic papillary carcinoma and\nthe same abnormal lymphoid population, with near complete\neffacement of residual normal nodal architecture in the\nTHIS CONFIDENTIAL AND PRIVILEGED DOCUMENT/INFORMATION IS PROTECTED BY\nFEDERAL AND STATE LAW.

This case was discussed with Dr. Per Dr.\nthe specimen submitted as deep margin (8) was taken from the left lateral tumor (specimen C).The left lateral tumor is not transec ted in the histologic\nsections examined .Multiple satellite foci (greater than 10) are noted in the renal parenchyma surrounding the three main lesions in specimen C-E. Some\nof these satellite lesions measure less than 1 mm. Therefore it is possible that the deep margin tumor in specimen B represents a separate focus of\ntumorrather than a positive margin from the left lateral tumor since the left lateral tumor was not transacted.A conversation with Dr also\nreveals that the upper pole tumor ( 0) was adherent to the specimen submitted as left cyst wall (A). The upper pole tumor showed a \u25ba+ a\u25baea of capsular\nretraction with ink focally extending to the tumor .This additional information from Dr. lakes it likely that this area of concern was the site of the\nadherent cyst and therefore does not represent a true margin.\nin summary, no tumor transection is noted ,however ,this patient is at increased risk for recurrence due to the numerous small satellite lesions noted.\nAddendum Reoort Issued Bv:\nMAD\nDIAGNOSIS:\nA.

SEE COMMENT. \nComment: \nThe aspirates are pauci-cellular and reveal rare small clusters of malignant epithelial cells in a background of blood. Only rare \nreactive bronchial cells and sparse inflammatory cells are present. The tumor cells are large with abundant granular cytoplasm and \nwell defined cell borders. The nuclei are enlarged and mildly pleomorphic with moderately Irregular contours, coarse chromatin \nand prominent central nucleoli. The morphologic findings are consistent with a renal cell carcinoma. To confirm the diagnosis and \nhelp exclude a primary lung tumor, we performed a panel of immunohistochemical stains on the cell block material with the \nfollowing resulls: \nAntibody \nCD10 \nPan-keratin \nCK7 \nCK20 \nRCC \nCD68 \nTTF-1 Usual reactivity \nRenal cell marker, \nEpithelial marker \nEpithelial marker \nEpithelial marker \nRenal cell marker \nHistiocyte marker \nPulmonary cell marker Result \nPositive \nPositive \nPositive \nNegative \nNegative \nNegative \nNegative \nThe immunohistochemical staining pattern supports the morphologic diagnosis. Positive staining for CD1 0 and pan keratin with \nnegative staining for CK 20 is consistent with renal cell carcinoma. Although CK7 is often negative in most renal cell carcinomas, \npositive staining can be seen in up to 1/3 of cases. Similarly, negative staining for ReC is seen in approximately 13% of cases. \nNegative staining for CD68 indicated the tumor cells are not reactive pulmonary macrophages which can have similar morphology \nin rare cases. Negative staining for TTF-1 also rules against a diagnosis of a primary lung carcinoma. Overall, based on \n. the final diagnosis is that of metastatic renal cell carcinoma. \nreviewed this case and concur with the diagnosis. \nLESS THAN OPTIMAL -SCANT CELLULARITY. \nNEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS. \nHYPERCELLUALR SPECIMEN WITH REACTIVE EPITHELIAL CELLS AND BLOOD (see comment). \nComment: ..

It is not certain whether or \nnot the tumor has invaded through Garota's fascia Into surrounding 60ft tissue, or whether this represen ts ~ \nsurgical defect in Gerow's fascia; therefore , the assigned pT stage is pT3a+. The case was discussed with \nwho indicated that he noted a small defect in the this area of the specimen during intraoperative examination , an _ \n)thought there was a small amount of residual tumor In the corresponding adjacent tissue near Ihe adrenal gland. He \nthen resected the adrenal gland and surrounding soft tissue. No tumor was recognized grossly In the adrenal specimen \n(part 2) during pathologic examination and se<:tlonlng; the remaining tissue in part 2 will be submitted for histology, wlth \nttie result to follow In an addendumr It is mO$t likely that the final margin in the 60ft tiuue adjacent to the upper pole of \nthe kidney Is benign. \n-The small tumor fragment in the main renal artery lumen (section 1A) was not Identified grossly, and is not attached 10 \nthe wan of the artery. However, the tumo~ cells are surrounded by fibrin. It is not certain whether this represents a tumor \nthromboembolus or an artifaclually displaced tumor fragment occurring during sectioning .

The possibility that the right \nand left tumors represent primary and metastatic lesions cannot be entirely excluded, but this is less likely. If requested, \nmutational genotyping of the left and right tumors may be performed to compare the mutational profiles of these tumors, \nto more objectively determine whether they are more likely to be independent or related. \nPart 4; The specimen part number 4 labeled \"eleventh rib\" has been subjected to a gross examination only, If it is desired \nthat this specimen be processed for additional stUdies, particularly microscopic examination, it is suggested that the \ncase pathologist be notified within two weeks of the slgnout date of this report.

The tumor is well-defined, orange-yellow, and extends into the renal vein. However, the specific type of cancer has not been determined and further microscopic examination is required for a definitive diagnosis. The presence of benign lymph nodes suggests that the cancer has not yet spread to the lymphatic system. The rib and adrenal gland specimens may be unrelated to the kidney tumor, as they are received in separate containers and do not have any obvious connection to the renal neoplasm."

The attached portion of Inferior vena cava measures 0.6 cm in \nlength and 3.9 cm in diameter with a protruding mass measuring 6.3 x 5.1 x 3.1 em attached to the wall ofinferior vena cava and \ncompletely obliterative the renal vein. The portion of renal artery measures 2.7 em long and 0.4 em in diameter. The renal artery \nand ureter margins are grossty unremarkable. An adrenal gland is Identified, measures 5.5 x 3.5 x 1.3 em and grossly appears \nunremarkable. The perinephric fat is of thickness ranging from 0.4 to 1.7 em. The kidney is Inked black and bivalved to reveal an \nIrregular soft mass with variegated appearance, measures 12.2 x 9.8 x 8.9 em, involving the entire upper pole and portion of the \nmiddle pole of the kidney. The mass appears to involve the perinephric fat, renal sinus and perihilar fat and grossly extends into \nthe renal vessels. The pelviealiceal system at the upper pole is completely compressed, while at the middle and 10Vier poles, does \nnot appear to be involved by the mass. Two 0.5 em In diameter renal calculi are noted present in the middle pole. The remainder \nof the middle and lower pole shows a muitiloculated cyst 2.4 cm in greatest dimension, which cannot be separated from the upper \npole mass as no uninvolved renal parenchyma is grossly Identified. Sections through the remainder of the kidney reveal a pink \nPage 2 of 4  brown parenchyma, with a well\u00b7defined cortico\u00b7medullary junction. The cortex measures 0.6 em.

The main tumor mass is predominant ly papillary and solid with focal tubular areas. It is high grade. Focal areas of \nnecrosis are evident.

The main tumor mass is immunoreactive for CK7 and focally for racemase . 11 is negative for \nCAS. The satellite nodules are immunoreactive for CK7 but negative for racemase. BAF47 is not interpretable. The overall \nappearance is suggestive of a syndrome-associated tumor although the unusual morphology does not allow us to make this \nstatement with confidence or to suggest the syndrome involved, if such is the case.

The sample \nof non~neoplastic kidney parenchyma examined showed diffuse parenchymal \nscarring and moderate vascular sclerosis, but only mild glomerulosclerosis. \nThese changes are most likely the result of chronic ipsilateral collecting \nsystem obstruction, with a possible contribution by venous obstruction from the \nrenal vein and inferior vena cava tumor thrombus.

Several tubules (block \nAIO) show microcystic changes resembling thyroidization of the corti~al \nparenchyma.

An independent and superimposed immune \ncomplex-mediated glomerulopathy has been ruled out. Also seen are superimposed \ncollapsing lesions in few of the glomeruli. To put these morphological lesions \nin better perspective it is important to correlate this finding with the degree \nof proteinuria and renal failure in this patient. Collapsing lesions are \nsometimes present in patients with advanced kidney disease due to other causesi \nwe have observed this type of lesions in a small percentage of end-stage \nkidneys removed during renal transplantation; the cause and mechanism of this \ntype of lesions is poorly understood at this time. However, a superimposed \ncollapsing glomerulopathy in this patient cannot be ruled out with\u00b7 certainty; \npatients with an active collapsing glomerulopathy can be expected to have a \nvery pronounced proteinuria and renal functional impairment. It may therefore \nbe prudent to determine the degree and the evolution of the proteinuria in this \npatient. \nprominent vascular sclerosis has traditionally been considered part of the \nstructural changes seen in diabetic patients with renal disease. These \nvascular lesions are non-specific, however, and similar changes characterize \nvarious primary forms of vascular injury in the kidney. Such conditions include \nthe healed phase of HUS/TTP and pro-coagulant states (thrombophilia, \nantiphospholipid antibody syndrome, etc.), autoimmune disorders (scleroderma, \nundifferentiated connective tissue disorders, etc.), toxic injury affecting \ncomponents of the vascular wall (vero cytotoxin, antibody-mediated vascular \ninjury, drugs with vascular toxicitYI etc.), physical factors (irradiation, \nstatus post bone marrow transplantation), and, potentially, metabolic diseases \nwith an important vascular component (gout, diabetes I hyperhOmocysteinemia, \netc.). Therefore, a primary form of vascular injury superimposed on diabetes \nmellitus should also be considered in the differential diagnosiS of this \npatient'S kidney disease. \nThe widespread cast formation in the distal tubules is worrisome. Although \nthese casts appear to be benign hyaline cast in that they are PAs-positive, \nthey do not appear fractured, they are not surrounded by a cell reaction, and \nthey are reactive for polyclonal IgA on immunofluorescence microscopy, a prior \nepisode of light chain cast nephropathy cannot be ruled out with absolute \ncertainty especially since the casts stain slightly stronger for lambda than \nfor kappa light chains. In my experience, myeloma casts loose their specific \nlight chain reactivity with time and become hyaline casts; they transform from \npure protein cast, which are characteristically PAS-negative, to conventional \n\u2022 ., ~ __ T\\'7'IC\" ............. \"\"{t-i.up casts and, with time, they take on reactivity for . ___ ... .:~ ....... t-..... !'!Prirch for a  paraprotein in the serum and in the urine. I have to stress here, that \ncast seen currently in this biopsy do not have the characteristics of \nmyeloma casts. \nThe kidney parenchyma has been reviewed by Dr. \nPathologist. \nMICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: Renal \nThe sample consists of renal cortex and outer medulla. There are two hundred \nand thirty four (234) glomeruli present in the sample submitted for light \nmicroscopy. Forty-four (44) glomeruli are globally obsolescent (sclerosed). \nThe preserved glomeruli show enlargement of the glomerular tuft with diffuse \nsclerosis of the mesangium and increase of the mesangial cells. Several \nglomeruli show characteristic Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodules. Double contours are \nnoted in some of the capillary loops with some glomeruli exhibiting signs of \nmesangiolysis. Focal reabsorption granules are also noted in two of the \nglomeruli with prominent epithelial cell proliferation and collapse of the \ncapillary tufts. Tubules reveal marked thickening of the tubular basement \nmembranes and focal tubular atrophy. PAS casts are seen. The interstitium is \nfocally replaced by dense connective tissue, particularly in the areas of \ntubular atrophy. Approximately 25% of the sample shows tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis, as evidenced on the trichrome stains (AFOG). Arteries \nreveal severe intimal sclerosis and duplication of the internal elastic lamina. \nArterioles show hyaline deposits in the vessel walls of both afferent and \nefferent arterioles. \nThe integrity of the renal parenchyma and the structural details of the \nbasement membranes were evaluated on sections stained \\-lith PAS, trichrome \n(AFOG), and Jones' silver methenamine. \nIMMUNOFLUORESCENCE MICROSCOPY REPORT 1IIIIIIII \nSections of frozen tissue were incubated wlth antibodi~s specific for the heavy \nchains of IgG, IgA, and IgM, kappa and lambda light chains, C3, Clq, albumin, \nand fibrin-related antigens. \nThe sample consists of kidney cortex and medulla. There are fifty-one (51) \nglomeruli present, of which ten are globally sclerosed. There are no \nsignificant immune deposits present in the glomeruli. There is segmental, \nirregular granular deposition of IgM and C3 in the mesangial areas., Tubules \ncontain reabsorbed proteins (albumin, IgG, C3) in the form of cytoplasmic \ngranules. Tubular basement membranes reveal focal deposition of C3 (++/4+). \nSeveral casts in the distal tubules are reactive for polyclonal IgA with a \nnoticeable overexpression of lambda over kappa light chains. Coarse IgM and C3 \ndeposits are present in the walls of several arterioles.

Nodular glomerulosclerosis is most often seen in the setting of \ndiabetic glomerulosclerosis, although similar changes also characterize \nparaprotein deposition diseases, tmmune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis, or \nprimary forms of vascular injury with endothelial damage and subsequent \nmesangial scarring. Paraprotein and immune complex deposition diseases can be \nruled out since the immunofluorescence microscopy shows no immunoglobulin \ndeposits. Because the history in this patient's electronic medical record does \nnot include mention\u00b7 of diabetes mellitus, additional studies were performed on \nthe kidney tissue to further define the nature of the glomerular disease. \nBased on the results of the immunofluorescence examination, the process seen \nhere is most likely mediated, at least in part,' by diabetes mellitus/metabolic \nsyndrome(or related conditions characterized by hyperglycemia and products of \nglycosylation) potentially with a superimposed primary form of vascular injury. \nRepeated endothelial or vascular injury may be reflective of an underlying \ninherited or acquired procoagulant state (e.g., idiopathic or systemic lupus \nerythematosus-associated antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, thrombophilic \ndysfibrinogenemia, the prothrombin G2021DA mutation, the factor V Leiden \nmutation, and other forms of resistance to activated protein C), a prior \npre-eclamptic gestation, autoimmune disorders (e.g., systemic lupus \nerythematosus, scleroderma, overlap syndrome), a healed episode of \nhemolytic-uremic syndrome or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, angiotoxic \ndrugs, phYSical factors (e.g., irradiation, status post bone marrow . \ntransplantation), malignant hypertension and, potentially, paraproteinemias or \nother metabolic diseases with an important vascular component (e.g., gout, \nhyperhomocysteinemia) . \nModeratelv advanced chronic changes of the kidney parenchyma are present. . ,.:.'  These changes are a result of functional adaptations to nephron loss from \nglomerular, tubular, interstitial, vascular, or mass-replacing pro~ess. \nsome degree of parenchymal scarring may be due to local compression effects \nthe ipsilateral masses, most of the chronic damage is likely secondary to \nvascular scarring. Therefore, a similar degree of chronic damage would be \nexpected in the contralateral kidney. This patient, therefore, may be at \nfor persistent or progressive proteinuria and renal insufficiency. \nThe kidney parenchyma has been reviewed by Dr. \nPathologist. \nMICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: Renal \nSections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue (block A12) were evaluated \nusing HE, PAS, Jones silver methenamine, and AFOG (trichrome) stains; an \nHE-stained frozen section was also evaluated by light microscopy. \nThe sample consists of cortex and medulla. There are 251 glomeruli present, of \nwhich 54 are globally sclerosed and 8 are segmentally sclerosed. The remaining \nglomeruli show expansion of the mesangial areas diffusely, with focal nodule \nformation. There are no discernible craters or spikes of the glomerular \ncapillary wall basement membranes. Several double contours are identified. \nApproximately 30-40% of the cortical parenchyma shows tubular atrophy and \ninterstitial fibrosis. Arteries and arterioles exhibit a moderate to severe \ndegree of sclerosis \\'lith hyalinosis. \nIMMUNOFLUORESCENCE MICROSCOPY \nSections of frozen tissue were \nchains of IgG, IgA, and IgM# kappa \nand fibrin-related antigens. an'ti.bc'dies specific for the heavy \nand lambda light chains, C3, Clq, albumin, \nThe sample consists of kidney cortex and medulla.

There is also segmental \ndeposition of IgM and,C3 in the mesangial areas. There is diffuse linear \ndeposition of albumin (++/4+) and IgG (+/4+) along all basement membranes. \nTubules contain reabsorbed proteins in the form of diffuse reabsorption \ndroplets. Tubular basement membranes reveal focal deposition of C3 (++/4+). \nMany casts in the distal tubules are-reactive for polyclonal IgA. Arterioles \nshow focal C3 reactivity.

Thin glornerul \nbasement membranes are often a phenotypic expression of an inherited \nabnormality in basement membrane collagens, and often manifest as persistent \nmicroscopic hematuria in affected patients and family members. In women, \nbasement membranes can be seen in carriers of the X-linked Alport syndrome \ngene, patients with autosomal recessive hereditary nephritis, and patients \nso-called benign hematuria or thin glomerular basement membrane disease. In \nmales, this phenotype can also be seen in early stages of the Alport syndrome \nand, similar to the situation in women, in patients with so-called thin \nglomerular basement membrane disease and autosomal recessive hereditary \nnephritis. Thin basement membrane disease has been associated with \nheterozygous defects in the gene for alpha 4 collagen IV and familial benign \nhematuriai persistent hematuria is inherited as a dominant trait, progressive \nrenal failure is inherited as recessive feature. The prevalence of this \ngenetic defect in the general population has been reported to be highi the \nestimates lie in the 2-9% range. Homozygous defects in alpha 4 or alpha 3 \ncollagen IV have been reported to be associated with autosomal recessive forms \nof hereditary nephritisi patients with this type of defect have the strongest \nfamily history of hematuria, and in general! both parents and all offspring can \nbe expected to have persistent microscopic hematuria.

L kidneyll, consists of a 1449 gm left nephrectomy specimen \n(26.0 x 11.5 x 8.5 em) including kidney (18.5 x 8.0 x 7.0 em), ureter (8.2 em \nin length x 0.5 em in diameter), renal vein (O.S em in length,x 0.2 em in \ndiameter), renal artery (2.6 cm in length x 0.6 em in diameter), and attached \nyellow/tan perinephric adipose tissue (up to 3.5 em in thickness). The \nspecimen is bivalved. In the lower pole, 8.5 em from the ureteral margin, 4.9 \nem from the renal artery margin, and 3.5 em from the renal vein margin, there \nis a well encapsulated yellow/red hemorrhagic centrally fibrotic mass (8.7 x \n7.4 x 5.7 em) compressing and distorting the renal parenchyma and the renal \ncapsule. Upon sectioning, the mass is approximately 90% solid and 10% eysti'e. \nThe mass comes to within 0.3 em of the blue inked deep/perinephric fat margin. \nThe mass focally compresses and distorts but does not grossly appear to invade \ninto the inferior pelvocaliceal system and renal sinus. \nThe uninvolved kidney parenchyma is tan/brown with a moderately distinct \ncortical medullary junction and approximately six smooth walled tan simple \ncortical cyst (ranging from 0.7 to 3.5 cm in greatest dimension) scattered \nthroughout the mid and superior poles. Each of the cysts is filled with clear \nserous fluid, with no excrescences grossly identified. The pelvQcaliceal \nsystem is moderately dilated and exhibits smooth glistening tan mucosa. The \nadrenal gland (6.2 x 2.5 x 1.2 em) is present and exhibits an unremarkable \ngolden yellow cortex (0.2 cm in maximum thickness) and red/brown medulla (D.l \nem in maximum thickness) . -CZ-5451  examined. There is no evidence of active glomerulitis, proliferative lesions or'\\ \nfibrinoid necrosis. \nThe kidney parenchyma has been reviewed by Dr \nPathologist. \nMICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: Renal \nSections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue (block A8) were evaluated \nusing HE, PAS, Jones silver methenamine, and AFOG (trichrome) stains. \nThe sample consists of cortex and medulla. There are 155 glomeruli present, of \nwhich 16 (10.3 %) are globally sclerosed. The remaining glomeruli show mild \nsigns of hypertrophy of the tuft. There is very mild, focal expansion of the \nmesangial areas. 0n PAS and Jones silver stains there are no discernible \ncrater-like defects or I1spikesll, and only isolated double contours of the \nglomerular capillary wall ba~ement membranes are recognized. Several distal \ntubule$ contain PAS-positive hyaline casts. Isolated distension of tubules is \nrecognized in the cortical area. Approximately 5% of the cortical parenchyma \nshows tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis as seen in the trichrome stain \n(AFOG). Arteries and arterioles exhibit moderate degree of sclerosis, with \nine accumulation in the subintima in the arterioles.

The deposits are localized and \ndistributed along the glomerular capillary \\I1al1 resembling a membranous \nglomerulopathy, however, the restricted immunoreactivity of the deposits is \nvery. unusual and would suggest a paraprotein deposition disease of the \nIgG/kappa type. It would therefore be prudent to test for circulating \nparaproteins in this patient. The possibility of a membranous glomerulopathy \nwith an unusual and restricted immunoreactivity of the deposits cannot be ruled \nout with certainty, however, the diagnosis of idiopathic or tumor-associated \nmembranous glomerulopathy should only be considered in this patient if \nci-rculating paraproteins and a plasma cell dyscrasia or other B cell \nlymphoproliferative disorders have been ruled out. \nMICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: \nThe sample consists of renal cortex and medulla not involved by the tumor. \nT4ere are more than 200 glomeruli present in the sample submitted for \nevaluation. About 15% of the glomeruli are globally obsolescent (sclerosed) . \n. The preserved glomeruli shot ... normal cellularity, without signs of inflanunation, \nfibrinoid necrosis, or sclerosis. The peripheral capillary walls reveal \nthickened basement membranes, with fine \"spikell-like projections and numerous \ndiffusely distributed \"crater-like\" defects visible in the basement membranes \nin the Jones silver stain. Tubules ShO\\,l normal cellular details. There are \nisolated, PAS-positive casts present in some distal tubules. Focal tubular \natrophy is seen in areas of interstitial fibrosis. Significant interstitial \ninflanunation is not evident in the sample examined. Approximately 20% of the \ntissue included in this biopsy shows tubular atrophy, mild mononuclear cell \ninflammation, and interstitial fibrosis, as evidenced on the trichrome stains \n(AFOG). Arteries show moderate sclerosis of the media, with focal replacement \nof smooth muscle cells by connective tissue. Arterioles reveal subintimal \nhyaline accumulation. \nIMMUNOFL~ tnCROSCOPY REPORT: \nKIDNEY~ \nThe sections were incubated with antibodies specific for the heavy chains of \nIgG, 19A, and 19M, for kappa light chains, lambda light chains, C3, Clq, \nalbumin, and fibrin-related antigens. \nThe sample consists of kidney cortex. There are 68 glomer'uli present. Eleven \n(11) glomeruli are globally sclerosed and one (1) glomerulus shows segmental \nsclerosis. There is diffuse granular deposition of 19G (3+/4+) along the \nperipheral glomerular capillary walls; these deposits are only reactive for \nkappa and not lambda light chains. There is dull reactivity for fibrin present \nalong &11 glomerular capillary walls. Tubules contain reabsorbed proteins \n(albumin, IgG, C3) in the form of cytoplasmic granules. The interstitium \nreveals scattered fibrin deposits. Arterioles show focal C3 reactivity. There \n'is no difference noted in the intensity of the staining for kappa and lambda \nlight chains in the casts in the backgroun~ of the tissue. \nELECTRO~Y REPORT: \nKIDNEY _ \nBlocks: 6; Blocks examined: 4 tnick sections; 1 thin section. \nThe tissue examined at the ultrastructural' level includes t\\,lO glomeruli. The \nglomerular capillary walls are greatly distorted by the presence of numerous \nsubepithelial electron dense deposits and thickening of the basement membranes. \nThe deposits are sparsely distributed and they appear to have been incorporated \ninto the outer aspect of the thickened basement membranes. The electron dense \ndeposi ts are finely g.ranular but they do not show organized substructures. \nThere is extensive effacement of visceral epithelial cell foot processes \npresent and microvillous degeneration of the epithelial cell membrane. \nGlomerular endothelial cells appear unremarkable and do not contain \ntubuloreticular structures. Subendothelial electron dense deposits are not \nseen. The mesangium shows normal cell elements and an extracellular matrix \n\\'lithout electron dense deposits. \nPage: 3 of3  Accession Number:\u00ad\nType: Cytogenetics \nSpecimen Type: \nProcedure Date: \nOrdering Provider: \nCASE:.IllIIIII __ _ \nPATIENT: \nCytogeneticist: Report Status: Final \nKARYOTYPE: Tl: 46,XX,der(3;5) (ql0;ql0) [10J \nT2: 46,XX,der(3:5) (ql0;ql0) [10J \nMETAPHASES COUNTED: 20 ANALYZED: 10 SCORED: 10 BANDING: GTG \nINTERPRETATION: \nAll rnetaphases for both specimens received contained der{3;5) (ql0;ql0), a \ncharacteristic. finding in renal cell carcinomas, clear cell type. \nCOMMENTS: \nThis analysis \n{Prenatal Diagnos \nnot be detectable \nperformed at a level \nINDICATION FOR TEST: greater. 25% at a 95% confidence limit \nSmall chromosome anomalies may \nemployed.

The renal artery and vein at the margin are grossly unremarkable. The 5.5 cm long\nureter is unremarkable at the margin. 4.5 cm from the margin of resection the lumen is partially\nobstructed by a bulging 1.5 x 1.0 cm tumor nodule extending from a 5.5 x 4.5 x 3.0 cm lobulated fleshy\ngray mass located in the lower pole. This mass is grossly confined within the renal capsule but invades\nthe renal collecting system. No extension into the scant amount of perinephric fat is identified. There is\na well delineation of pale kidney tissue surrounded by viable kidney tissue in the upper pole adjacent to\nthe mass. There are two additional simple cysts, one in the upper pole, one in the lower pole up to 0.9\ncm. The surrounding kidney tissue is unremarkable. No enlarged lymph nodes are identified.\nMicroscopic Description: Procedure type: Radial nephrectomy\nHistologic grade (Fuhrman): Grade 4 (with other areas of grade 3)\nSarcomatoid features: Present (approximately 10%)\nTumor size: 5.5 cm\nExtent: Directly invades renal sinus fat and renal pelvis\nAdrenal Gland: Not present in specimen/Ct --a - 3\n,Oczp Iaj, / Lt'J &.

Patchy scarring and chronic pyelonephritis,\nlikely related to tumor effect.\nDiagnosis Details:\nComments: Tumor morphology is unusual and does not fit typical classification schemes. Some areas\nhave papillary growth, others are more solid and infiltrative with irregular, infiltrative borders into the\nrenal parenchyma. Numerous areas are solid with large epithelial cells with granular cytoplasm. Tumor\ninvades the collecting system which has been associated with more aggressive neoplasm.\nSome features raise the possibilty of a translocation-associated carcinoma or possibly a hereditary\nsyndrome-type carcinoma.\nImmunostains for cytokeratin 1, P504, pancytokeratin, CD10, p63, and PAX-8 were performed. The\ntumor cells are positive for PAX-8 and P504. Pancytokeratin stains portions of the tumor strongly (the papillary areas )but is negative in other areas .CK7 and CD10 are negative .p63 is negative. This\nimmunostaining pattern is not specific and does not clarify the differential diagnosis further ,other than\nto confirm that is is a renal cell carcinoma.\nADDENDUM REPORT\nThe consultant opinion is that this tumor is best classified as a papillary renal cell carcinoma (type 2),\nwith foci of sarcomatoid and rhaboid change .However ,a renal cell carcinoma related to hereditary\nleiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer syndrome (HLRCC )cannot be excluded .To exclude this, clinical\nevaluation for cutaneous leiomyomas and genetic testing (can be performed on peripheral blood) for\nmutations of the fumarate hydratas gene are suggested.\nFormatted Path Reports :KIDNEY TISSUE CHECKLIST\nSpecimen type :Nephrectomy\nTumor site: Kidney\nTumor size: 5 .5 x 4.5 x 3 cm\nFocality :Single -\nHistologic type: Papillary adenocarcinoma\nHistologic grade :Undifferentiated\nTumor extent: Extension to perinephric tissues\nLymph nodes :Not specified\nLymphatic invasion :Not specified\nVenous invasion :Not specified\nMargins :Uninvolved\nEvidence of neo-adjuvant treatment :Not specified\nAdditional pathologic findings :The tumor cells are positive for PAX -8 and P504 .CK7 and CD10 are\nnegative .p63 is negative.\nComments: Kidney- left\nOlt\nPnm :1y 'umor Sitc -)iscrepincy\nfd q U;- repancy\nF\u201e' '^a!: r;,an:yI I ;stnry",

At the renal hilum is a 15 x 5 x 4 cm portion of fibroadipose, nodular lymph nodes and probable tumor.   Sectioning of the renal parenchyma reveals an inferior pole 6.5 x 5.5 x 6.1 cm firm, tan mass with \nirregular edges.  Surrounding the main tumor mass the renal parenchyma contains multiple, small \nnodules of tumor that appear to be separate from the primary mass.  Portions of the tumor cut surface show necrosis and hemorrhage.  The tumor invades hilar adipose and encases the renal artery and vein at the hilum.  There is no tumor present in the lumen of vascular margins.  Tumor also encases \nproximal ureter, but the ureter is probe patent.  Tumor obliterates the renal pelvis.  The 3.0 x 2.5 x 1.0 \ncm adrenal gland is hemo rrhagic but uninvolved by tumor.  Tumor appears to penetrate renal capsule \nonly towards the renal hilum.  There does not appear to be penetration of Gerota's fascia.   Remaining renal parenchyma has a reasonably well defined cortico- medullary junction.  Se ctioning of the hilar soft \ntissue reveals that it is largely replaced by an 11 x 4.5 x 3.5 cm lobulate mass of tumor that is contiguous with the tumor in the kidney.

LEFT KIDNEY Received fresh, labeled with the patients name and \"left kidney\" is an intact kidney with attached perinephric fat measuring 14.9 x 8.3 x 6.2 cm, and weighing 346 grams collectively.   The isolated \nkidney measures 13 x 6.9 x 3.3 cm.   Extending from the renal pelvis are a ureter (7 cm in length and 0.3 \ncm in diameter), renal vein (1.2 cm in length and 0.7 cm in diameter), and renal artery (1.1 cm in diameter and 0.5 cm in diameter).   Tumor grossly appears to extend into the ureter and but is not \npresent at the resection margin.   There is a 9.5 x 6.5 x 3.3 cm poorly circumscribed, solid to partially \ncystic, variegated mass with hemorrhage and necrosis in the lower pole involving the cortex, medulla and invading into the renal pelvis.   It is adjacent to the renal hilum.  The mass grossly  appears to invade \nperinephric fat.   The uninvolved renal parenchyma is tan-brown with a well -defined cortico -medullary \njunction.

Fusion  \nsignals of the ASPSCR1 locus and theTFE3 locus were not identified in this specimen. These  \nresults do not exclude a TFE3 translocation in this tumor as such tumors in the kidney can  \nhave multiple fusion partners.  \nSource of case   \nBlock used  NA \nTissue fixation  formalin -fixed tissue  \nTissue source  kidney  \nLimitations  \nANALYTE SPECIFIC REAGENT: The use of one or more reagents in the above tests is regulated as  \n an analyte specific reagent (ASR).  These tests were developed and their performance  \ncharacteristics determined by the  the.  They have not \nbeen cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration.  The  \nFDA has determined that such clearance or approval  is not necessary.  \n Overview of this test  \n The ASPSCR1 -TFE3 Dual Color, Dual Fusion Translocation Probe is designed to detect the  \n juxtaposition of ASPSCR1 (also known as ASPL) to the transcription factor TFE3. Translocation of  \n ASPSCR1 (also known as AS PL) to the transcription factor TFE3, der(17)t(X;17)(p11.2;q25), is  \n characteristic of alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS) and present in the majority of cases. The  \n ASPSCR1 PDGFB  Dual Color, Dual Fusion Translocation Probe is a mixture of the ASPSCR1 \nprobe \n  (BAC clones RP11 -756O14, RP11-455O6 and RP11-428B22 centromeric of ASPSCR1) labeled  \n with SpectrumGreen and the TFE3 probe labeled with SpectrumOrange (BAC clones RP11 -552E4,  \n RP11 -344N17 and RP11- 753G22 telomeric of TFE3). The expected pattern in a normal nucleus  \n hybridized with the ASPSCR1- TFE3 probe is the two orange, two green signal pattern. In a nucleus  \n harboring  the der(17)t(X;17)(p11.2;q25), the most common pattern is one orange signal, one green  \n  signal, and one orange/green (yellow) fusion signals resulting from the reciprocal translocation.  \n  \n This probe was labeled in the according to the method of  \nand  \n its use is regulated as an ASR \n \n R.

We \ninterpret these nodules as recurrent tumor from the patient' s original renal  \ncell carcinoma that arose from reported seeding during the prior laparoscopic  \npartial nephrectomy (pathology material from that procedure is not available for  \nreview). The tumor adjacent to the kidney is associated with old scarring and  \nfibrosis likely related to the prior surgical procedure. There is no tumor in the renal parenchymal scar. There is focal invasion of the psoas muscle by the  \n tumor and so the local pathologic stage is considered rpT4. A small lymph node  \nwith metastatic papillary adenocarcinoma is seen adjacent to the psoas  mass.  \nHistologic sections of the unattached mass show a lymph node with metastatic  \npapillary adenocarcinoma.   Both nodes show extracapsular extension of the tumor.  \n \nThe dimensions of the tumor nodules in the perirenal fat are:  \n      \n     Posterior -superior -medial           2.5 x 2.0 x 1.3 cm.  \nPsoas                     3.5 x 3.0 x 2.0 cm.  \nPosterior -inferior -lateral           1.1 cm in greatest dimension.  \nPosterior -interpolar -lateral           1.4 cm in greatest dimension.  \n Gross Description:  \nThe specimen is rec eived in a container of formalin, labeled with the patient's  \nname and \"right radical nephrectomy.\" It consists of a kidney and surrounding  \nperinephric fat, measuring 16 x 10 x 6.5 cm.   An additional portion of adipose  \ntissue accompanies the kidney, measuri ng 10.5 x 8.0 x 1.5 cm.   Prior to receipt  \nin the histology suite, the external surface of the kidney was inked with black  \nink.  The posterior aspect of the kidney was previously sectioned in a coronal  \nplane. A portion of a mass in the posterior -medial -superior perinephric fat was  \nbanked for future research.   A portion of ureter measuring 10 cm in length by  \n0.3 cm in diameter is attached to the kidney.   The ureter is probe patent.  \nShort segments of the renal artery and vein protrude from the specimen.   The \nrenal vein is patent and free of thrombus.   The renal artery is patent and free  \nof thrombus.   A globular, firm, tan, homogeneous mass traversed by fibrous  \nseptae is present in the perinephric fat, posterior -medial -superior to the  \nkidney, measuring 2.5 x 2. 0 x 1.3 cm.   A portion of this mass was previously  \nharvested for research. The surface of the mass abuts the resection margin, but  \ndoes not appear to penetrate the resection margin.   The mass compresses, but  \ndoes not appear to invade the renal cortex.   A portion of psoas muscle is  \npresent on the posterior/inferior aspect of the specimen, measuring 4.0 x 2.5 x  \n0.6 cm.   The psoas overlies a globular, firm, tan homogeneous mass traversed by  \nfibrous septae, measuring 3.5 x 3.0 x 2.0 cm.

The  \nmajority of the H/E slides demonstrate a papillary architecture but there are  \nmany areas that are difficult to classify. Numerous immunohistochemical stains  \n and additional sections help support the above diagnosis but the tumor may  \nbetter be represented as unclassified type. The translocation carcinoma is  \nvirtually ruled out with the negative HMB45 and Melan- A. The tumor is variable  \npositive for cytokeratin 34betaE12 and CK7 in the more papillary areas with  \ndiffuse positivity with cytokeratin AE1/AE3. There is also a nonspecific  \nperinuclear dote like staining with the p63. There does not appear to be any  \nmucin.   The overall staining with posit ive CK7, PAX -2, AMACR, and focal CD10  \nsupport a papillary renal cell carcinoma but does not totally rule out a  \ncollecting duct carcinoma/medullary carcinoma. The patient does not have a  \nhistory of sickle cell trait and the morphology is not convincing of m edullary  \ncarcinoma. The possibility of an invasive urothelial carcinoma is unlikely  \nbecause extensive sampling failed to demonstrate malignant TCC or CIS component.  \nA TTF -1 immunostain was also negative. The above stains were performed with  \nadequate contro ls. \n \nGross Description:  \nThe specimen is received in formalin three parts labeled with the patient's  \nname. \nPart A labeled\"interaortocaval lymph nodes\" and consists of a portion of  \nirregular, ragged, gray -yellow, lobulated fat, which has dimensions of 3.0 x 2.6 \nx 0.8 cm.

The specimen has  \ndimensions of 15.6 x 7.4 x 6.6 cm. The renal parenchyma has dimensions of 10.4 x  \n6.2 x 5.4 cm. An adrenal gland is not present. There is an attached segment of  \nureter, which has a length of 7.9 cm and a diameter of approximately 0.5 cm  \nthroughout. The vessels are identified and ligated close to the kidney. Some tissue has been submitted fresh to the   \nSize, appearance, and location of tumor:   The central kidney is remarkable for a  \ngray-white, indurated, fibrous mass with lobulated edges, which has dimensions  \n of 6.5 x 6.2 x 5.0 cm.  \nRenal capsule/renal sinus:   At the hilum, this mass extends to the capsule. It  \nis possible there are some foci where the mass traverses   the capsule and  \nsuperficially invades the hilar fat. The renal sinus fat is grossly invaded.  The \nmass extends through the capsule, into the perinephric fat and to within 1 mm of  \nthe posterior inked soft tissue edge.  \nRenal vein:   The renal vein is grossly invaded and extends to within 0.3 cm of  \nthe renal vein margin.  \nLymph nodes (size, number, &  location):   An exhaustive search of the hilar fat  \nto include the use of palpation and a chemical clearing agent reveals no grossly  \nidentifiable lymph nodes.  \nOther findings:   The renal parenchyma is red- brown with a well defined  \ncorticomedullary border and a cortical thickness of approximately 0.6 cm  \nthroughout. The urothelium is gray -white, smooth and glistening with some of the \npelvis and calyces markedly compressed by this mass.

While the tumor appears mostly confined to the kidney,\nthe tumor focally\ninvades through the renal capsule to involve perinephric fat,\nand is very close\n(within 1 mm) to the Gerota' s fascia/perinephric fat margin.\nThe tumor also\nabuts the adrenal gland, and involves the medulla of the adrenal\ngland through\ndirect extension. The superior medial aspect of the tumor was\npartially\ndisrupted, and tumor focally extends to ink in the area of\ndisruption.\nThe differential diagnosis for this high grade sarcoma includes\ndedifferentiated\nliposarcoma and pleomorphic leiomyosarcoma. The tumor is\npositive for desmin,\nCD34, CD10, and vimentin, results which are non-specific and may\nbe seen in\neither tumor type. There are focal abnormal cells within the\nfatty tissue and\nfibrous bands adjacent to the sarcoma (slides A17 and A19),\nwhich raises the possibility of dedifferentiated\nthe perinephric\nfat does not appear\nstains highlight\nprominent blood and\nnot stain the\ntumor cells.

The tumor\nnegative for calponin, c-kit,\nGIST or\nangiomyolipoma. While primary\nleiomyosarcoma is the\nmost common primary renal\nkidney most oftenand HMB45, lending no support\nrenal sarcomas are rare,for\nsarcoma .Liposarcomas involving the\narise in the retroperitoneum and\nbut primary\nrenal liposarcomas have beensecondarily involve the kidney,\nreported.\nReferral testing for MDM2 gene amplification testing is being\nrequested and the\nresults will be reported in an addendum. MDM2 is amplified in\nwell-differentiated liposarcomas and some dedifferentiated\nliposarcomas, and may\nbe helpful in determining if the sarcoma has an adipocytic\norigin.\nThe case was discussed with Dr. onDrs. and\nhave reviewed the case and agree with the diagnosis of high\ngrade pleomorphic sarcoma.\nClinical History:\n-year-old with a left renal mass.\nGross Description:\nReceived are two appropriately labeled containers. Specimen A:\nSpecimen fixation: Formalin\nType of specimen: Nephrectomy\nSide of specimen: Left\nSize and weight of specimen: 1,720 grams, 29 x 19 x 10 cm\noverall with\na 15 x 9 x 9 cm kidney, 8 cm of attached ureter and abundant\nattached\nperinephric fat.\nOrientation: The external surface is inked blue and there is a 6\ncm full thickness defect exuding tumor tissue along the superior\nmedial aspect\nof the specimen. The edges of this defect are marked with yellow\nink for\nidentification purposes.\nPresence/absence of adrenal gland: Adrenal gland is present (5.7\nx 2.0 x 0.5\ncm)\nTumor site: The tumor is present in the superior pole and\nextends\nmedially and superiorly.\nTumor description: The tumor is a fleshy gray/tan friable mass\nlining a dominant cyst. The edges of the cyst are focally fleshy\nand more solid\nappearing. The tumor has a markedly mucinous component.\nTumor size: 14 x 11 x 10 cm\nPresence /absence of multicentricity: Absent\nConfinement/non-confinement to the kidney: Indeterminate due to\nthe\ndisrupted nature of the superior medial aspect. The tumor\nappears partially\nencapsulated and well-demarcated from the perinephric fat and\nadjacent renal\nparenchyma of the inferior pole.\nExtent of invasion: Perirenal adipose tissue: Tumor grossly does not involve\nGerota' s fascia: Tumor grossly does not involve.\nRenal vein: Tumor grossly does not involve.\nUreter: Tumor grossly does not involve.\nRenal Sinus: Tumor grossly does not involve.\nPelvicaliceal: Tumor grossly does not involve.\nAdrenal: Tumor grossly involves the medulla of the\nadrenal.

Per their\nprotocol, MDM2/SE12 ratios greater than 2.0 are considered\namplified. While\nFISH for MDM2 gene amplification is intended to differentiate\nwell-differentiated liposarcomas/atypical lipomatous tumors from\nlipomas, gene\namplification in this tumor suggests that this tumor has\nlipocytic\ndifferentiation.",

Underlying this is a 4.1 x 4.0 x 4.0 mass which extends from\nthe inferior pole of the kidney. On sectioning , the mass has a variegated,\nyellow-red, soft and focally hemorrhagic cut surface. Itappears\nwell-circumscribed and does not appear to extend into the perirenal fat or\nrenal sinus , and is not present at the soft tissue margin of the specimen.\nThe closest soft tissue margin is approximately 2 cm from the tumor.\nSatellite nodules of tumor are not present in the renal tissue. Dissection\nof the renal veins does not show intravascular presence of neoplasm. The\nrenal parenchyma is pale ,with blurred corticomedullary demarcations.\nThere is one large cyst present in the superior pole and several much\nsmaller cysts scattered throughout the renal parenchyma. The cysts are\nlined by a smooth wall and are filled with clear fluid. The largest cyst\nmeasures 2.0 cm in largest diameter and the smaller cysts range in size\nfrom 0.2 to 0.5 cm in diameter. A partially fragmented adrenal gland is\nvisible on the surface of the specimen measuring 5.5 x 1.2 x 1.0 cm and\nweighing 5.6 grams. The adrenal is without nodules but is somewhat\nhemorrhagic . It does not appear involved by the mass ,and the closest\nportion of mass is approximately 7 cm distant. A 5.0 cm segment of ureter\nis present and is essentially unremarkable.

The specimen consists of a nephrectomy \nweighing 215.1 grams and measuring 12 x 10 x 4 cm in dimension. No palpable mass is present. The surgical \nmargin is inked in black and bivalved via the antehilar surface to reveal a kidney-colored nodule measuring 2.1 \nx 1.5 cm at the corticomedullary junction. 'The tumor is greater than 2 cm from the closest surgical margin and \nis well circumscribed. A 1 x 1 cm piece of nodule and a 1 x 1 cm piece of normal-appearing parenchyma is \nprocured for UOB. Photographs have been taken of the case. The procurement was performed by\n In Surgical Pathology, the specimen is received in a formalin-filled container. The \nspecimen has been previously bivalved and half of the tumor has been shelled out. The remainder of the \ntumor is located at the corticomedullary junction: Cut sectioning of the tumor demonstrates a browr~ish, normal- \nappearing kidney parenchyma surrounding the nodular tan-brown tumor mass. Deep to the tumor within the \ncortex is a clear fluid-filled cortical cyst. On half of the kidney which was previously procured, the tumor \nappears to infiltrate into the normal-appearing kidney parenchyma with pushing borders in a very thin white \ncaps~~le surrounding the tumor from the normal kidney. The tumor does not appear to involve the hilum and is \n0.3 cm from the hilar edge of the kidney, and 0.4 cm from the perinephric fat. The vascular and ureteral \nmargins are grossly free of tumor. Sectioning through the remainder of the kidney demonstrates brown-tan, \nunremarkable kidney parenchyma with no additional nodules are mass is seen. There is no perinephric fat \nsurrounding the capsule of the kidney deep to 'the tumor nodule. Sectioning through the hilar fat demonstrates \nno lymph node candidates. Analysis of the renal artery demonstrates an area of atherosclerosis which is \napproximately 60% occluded. There are no additional nodules or masses seen in the perinephric fat. \nRepresentative sections are submitted as follows: - -. \nI A-C - tumor at closest surgical margin and hilum . - \"1 D - vascular and ureteral margin .- . \n, -- - E - normal kidney parenchyma \n.'
