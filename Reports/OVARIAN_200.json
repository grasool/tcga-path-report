Parts C-F are received in formalin. \nPrimary surgery 2 of 4 \n Part A, additionally labeled \"omentum,\" consists of a section of red-tan, fibrofatty and firm tissue \nmeasuring \n13.0 x 13.0 x 2.0 cm. The specimen is studded with multiple yellow-tan to yellow-white nodules \nranging in \nsize from 0.2 cm up to 2.5 cm in greatest dimension. A 1.0 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm portion of the specimen is \ntaken for tumor banking, and representative sections are submitted in cassettes Al-A2. \nPart B, additionally labeled \"right ovary plus tube,\" consists of a partially cystic, partially solid structure \nwith no identifiable ovary and attached fallopian tube, which measures 11.0 x 9.0 x 4.0 cm and weighs \n238.2 gm. The cystic portion measures 4.0 cm in greatest dimension and has a cyst wall that ranges \nbetween 0.1 and 0.2 cm in greatest dimension, and has two exophytic papillary-like structures on the \nexternal surface, which measure 2.0 and 0.8 cm in greatest dimension, respectively. Deep to these, the \nspecimen is solid and has a fleshy, yellow-tan, irregular parenchyma. The solid portion measures 4.0 x 3.0 \nx 2.0 cm. The attached fallopian tube measures 3.5 cm in length x 0.4 cm in average diameter, is smooth, \npink-tan, and otherwise unremarkable. The external surface of the specimen is inked in black. A \nrepresentative section of the solid portion is SUbmitted as frozen section 1 with the remnant in cassette B1. \nThe remainder of the specimen is submitted as follows: \nCassette B2: Representative sections of fallopian tube. \nCassette B3: Representative sections of larger mass on exterior surface of cyst. \nCassette B4: Representative sections of smaller exophytic mass on external surface of cyst. \nCassettes B5-B6: Additional representative sections of cyst. \nCassettes B7-Bl0: Representative sections of solid portion of cyst. \nPart C, labeled \"uterus, cervix, left ovary and tube and rectosigmoid colon,\" consists of a uterus, attached \ncervix, fallopian tube and attached soft tissue tumor mass, and attached short segment of sigmoid colon. \nThe uterine specimen measures 7.5 cm from superior to inferior, 5.5 cm from cornu to cornu and 4.0 cm \nfrom anterior to posterior. The cervix measures 3.5 cm from side to side, 3.0 cm from anterior to posterior \nand approximately 2.0 cm in length. The serosal surface of the uterus is tan-brown, smooth and glistening, \nwith areas of subserosal hemorrhage scattered throughout. The cervical mucosa is tan-white, smooth and \nglistening, again with small areas of punctate mucosal and submucosal hemorrhage. The specimen probes \nto 6.5 cm and is opened along the lateral surfaces. The endocervical mucosa is pale tan and measures 1.0 \nmm in thickness. The endometrium is also pale tan, and free of polyps and masses. The endometrium \nmeasures 2.0 mm in thickness. The myometrium is serially sectioned, revealing no mural lesions. The \nmyometrium averages 1.3 cm in thickness. Two nodular masses of tissue are attached to the left surface of \nthe uterus. The serosal surfaces of both are similar, each with a very nodular contour, covered by a \ntan-brown serosa, and grossly obvious tumor nodules. Grossly, it is difficult to ascertain which of these \ntwo masses contains the ovary, however one does appear to be attached to the uterus by a tubular \nstructure, likely the fallopian tube. This portion of tissue measures 7.5 x 4.5 x 4.0 cm and the adjacent \ntubular structure measures 2.5 cm in length, with an average diameter of 1.0 cm. Serial sections through \nthe mass reveal no grossly obvious ovarian tissue, though a lumen filled with necrotic tissue is identified in \nthe previously-described tubular structure. The adjacent mass of tissue has a similar gross appearance \nand measures 5.5 x 4.5 x 3.5 cm. One portion of the specimen contains a thin-walled cyst filled with \ntranslucent fluid, measuring 3.0 cm in greatest diameter. On cut section, the specimen is composed of \nmultiple nodules of tan-white, firm tissue ranging in size between 0.5 and 2.0 cm. Adherent to the uterus \nand ovary is a segment of large bowel measuring 14.0 cm in length with an average diameter of 4.0 cm. \nThe serosal surface is diffusely caked with tumor nodules ranging in size between 0.2 and 0.5 cm, though \nwith confluence of tumor in other areas. What is thought to be the proximal margin is received stapled \nshut, with the distal margin remaining open. Upon opening, a scant, tan-brown mucoid material is \nidentified. The mucosa is pale tan, and unremarkable. Sections are submitted as follows: \nCassette C 1: Anterior cervix. \nCassette C2: Posterior cervix. \nCassette C3: Anterior endomyometrium. \nCassette C4: Posterior endomyometrium. \nCassettes C5-C6: Sections of putative ovary. \nPrimary surgery 3 of 4  Cassette C7: Putative fallopian tube. \nCassettes C8-C9: Mass adjacent to ovary. \nCassette CIO: Proximal bowel margin. \nCassette Cll: Distal bowel margin. \nCassette C12: Sections through unremarkable bowel mucosa. \nCassette C13: Representative sections of small bowel serosa. \nPart D, labeled\" rectum, staples proximal,\" consists of a single, short segment of rectum measuring 6.5 cm \nin length with an average diameter of 2.5 cm. Attached to the specimen is a large amount of very irregular \nand fragmented brown-tan, fibrous connective tissue measuring 8.5 cm in width x 4.0 x 2.5 cm. The \nsurrounding soft tissue is inked prior to opening of the staple surface at the proximal margin. The \nspecimen is opened to reveal pale tan-brown, glistening mucosa with no grossly identifiable masses or \nlesions. A section of the proximal margin is submitted in cassette D 1. A section of the distal margin is \nsubmitted in cassette D2. A random section is submitted in cassette D3. The attached fibrous connective \ntissue is serially sectioned, revealing a pericolonic mass of tan-white tumor measuring 3.0 x 2.5 x 2.0 cm. \nThe tumor mass approaches the proximal margin of resection within 1.0-2.0 mm, and the lateral margin of \nresection within 3.0 mm. A representative section is submitted in cassette D4. \nPart E, labeled \"transverse colon tumor,\" consists of an irregular and fragmentary tan-brown, polypoid \nmass measuring 3.4 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm. The specimen is serially sectioned, and representative sections are \nsubmitted in cassette E1. \nPart F, labeled \"small bowel mesentery,\" consists of a single ovoid nodule of yellow-tan, soft tissue \nmeasuring 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm. The specimen is entirely submitted in cassette F1. \nPart G, labeled \"bladder peritoneum,\" consists of an irregular and fragmentary tan-brown, polypoid mass \nmeasuring 3.4 x 1.8 x 1.0 cm.

The solid \nportion (8.5 x 6.6 x 4.0 \ncm) is soft, pink-tan with areas of apparent necrosis, and comprises approximately \n40% of the mass. The \ncystic portion of the mass is composed of multiple smooth walled cystic spaces \nwithout excresences. No \nresidual ovary is identified in the mass. The solid portion infiltrates through the distal \nportion of the \nrectum with invasion through the rectal wall, ulceration of the mucosa, and \npenetration into the lumen. \nThe proximal and distal margins of the colon/rectum are free of tumor. Tumor \napproaches to wthin 3.Scm \nfrom the distal margin (rectum) and to within 10 cm of the proximal margin \n(descending colon). The tumor \ncontains a cauterized surface near it's invasion into the rectum. The surgeon \nindicates the separate \nsegment of left ureter was present adjacent to this cauterized area. Additionally, \ntumor infiltrates into the \nposterior wall of the uterus with invasion into but not through the myometrial wall. \nThe uterine cavity \noverlying the area of tumor invasion appears grossly unremarkable. The tumor does \nnot appear to involve \nany other structures grossly. Two lymph nodes are found between the ovarian mass \nand the rectum. \nRepresentative sections of the solid component of the mass and sections of tumor  infiltrating rectum are \nsubmitted for frozen section diagnosis #1 with the frozen remnants in cassettes Al\u00ad\nA3. Additionally, \nportions of the mass as well as uninvolved endomyometrium are submitted for \nresearch. \nThe uterus additionally shows multiple nodules, sub-mucosal and sub-serosal, with \nfirm, white-tan cut \nsurfaces showing a whorled appearance. These nodules range in size from 0.7 to \n2.2cm in maximal \ndiameter and do not appear to be associated with the adnexal mass. No areas of \nhemorrhage, necrosis, or \ncystic degeneration are identified in these nodules. The ectocervix (1.0 x 1.0 cm) has \na smooth white-tan \nsurface without focal lesions. The cervical os is fish-mouthed and measures 0.7 cm in \ngreatest dimension. \nThe endocervix has glistening tan-brown mucosa and appears grossly unremarkable. \nThe endometrium is \nthin, tan-brown, and grossly appears atrophic. The right ovary is white-tan, \nmeasures 2.5 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm \nand shows no gross abnormalities. The right fallopian tube (4.5 cm length x 0.5 cm \ndiameter) appears \ngrossly unremarkable. The anatomic area of the left fallopian tube appears to consist \nentirely of infiltrating \ntumor and no residual fallopian tube is identified grossly. The separate portion of left \nureter is unoriented, \nappears intact, and shows no evidence of involvement by tumor. \nRepresentative sections are submitted as follows: \nCassettes Al-A3: Frozen section remnants. \nCassette A4: Cervix, anterior and posterior. \nCassette A5: Leiomyomata. \nCassette A6: Endomyometrium. \nCassette A7: Right ovary and right fallopian tube. \nCassette A8: Two regional lymph nodes. \nCassettes A9-A10: Cystic portion of mass. \nCassettes All-A12: Tumor near inked cyst wall. \nCassettes A13-A14: Distal colon margin, en face. \nCassettes A15-A16: Proximal colon margin, en face. \nCassettes A17-A18: Tumor infiltrating uterus. \nCassettes A19-A20: Bowel with tumor and cauterized area (inked) and cyst wall; \ninked margin in cassette \nA20. \nCassettes A21-A22: Cauterized inked margin and bowel. \nCassettes A23-A27: Representative sections of tumor under ovarian cyst. \nCassette A28: Large bowel tumor and margin (cauterized). \nCassettes A29-A30: Representative sections of large bowel tumor. \nCassette A31: Small colonic tumor. \nCassettes A32-A33: Extra colonic nodule. \nCassettes A34-A35: Representative sections of uninvolved bowel. \nCassette A36: Either end of left ureter. \nCassettes A37-39: Colon with left ovary. \nCassettes 40-42: Left ovary. \nPart B is additionally labeled \"2 -left pelvic lymph node,\" and consists of two  , \ntan-brown, irregularly shaped tissue fragments, the larger measuring 3.0 x 1.5 x 1.0 \ncm and the smaller \nmeasuring 2.0 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm. The specimen appears to consist of candidate nodes \nwith a small portion of \nPage 3 of 6 \nattached adipose tissue.

The remaining candidate nodes are submitted \nin cassette B2. \nPart C is additionally labeled \"1 -myoma,\" and consists of one unoriented, firm, \nwhite-tan, irregularly \nshaped tissue fragment measuring 4.5 x 4.0 x 2.5 cm and weighing 26.9 gm. The \nspecimen is inked blue. \nCross sectioning reveals white-tan tissue in a whorled pattern, consistent with \nleiomyoma. No areas of \nhemorrhage, necrosis or cystic degeneration are identified. Three representative \nsections are submitted in \ncassette C1. \nPart D is additionally labeled \"4 -right pelvic lymph node,\" and consists of three \nunoriented, rubbery, \ntan-brown, irregularly shaped tissue fragments, the largest measuring 2.5 x 2.0 x \n1.3 cm. The specimen \nmeasures 3.0 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm in aggregate. The largest fragment is bisected and \nsubmitted in cassette D1. \nThe two smaller fragments are submitted in cassette D2. \nPart E is additionally labeled \"6 -sigmoid donut,\" and consists of two unoriented \ndonut fragments of colon, \nthe larger measuring 2.5 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm and the smaller measuring 1.5 x 1.5 x 1.0 \ncm. Tissue is teased \naway from the staples, and sections of the larger fragment are submitted in cassette \nEl. Sections of the \nsmaller fragment ar.e submitted in cassette E1. \nPart F is additionally labeled \"5 -omentum,\" and consists of one unoriented soft, \nyellow-tan, irregularly \nshaped fragment of fatty and membranous tissue, measuring 9.0 x 4.0 x 1.0 cm. \nThe specimen is thinly \nsliced, revealing no nodules or other focal lesions. The specimen consists of \nunremarkable-appearing fatty \ntissue. Three representative sections are submitted in cassette Flo \nwere developed and their performance characteristics \nhave not been cleared or approved by the U. S. Food and \nI \nFDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These tests are used for clinical \npurposes. They should not \nbe regarded as investigational or for research. This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory \n~m\"ndrnents of \nncr/orm \n  \n \nResult of Her-2/neu test: This carcinoma is negative for Her-2/neu \noncoprotein overexpression. \nAn immunohistochemical assay was performed on block All using the CBll \nmonoclonal antibody to \nHer-2/neu oncoprotein. The staining intensity of this carcinoma was 0 on a scale of \n0-3 with focal \ncytoplasmic staining only. \nCarcinomas with staining intensity scores of a or 1 are considered negative for \noverexpression of Her-2/neu \noncoprotein. \nThose with a staining intensity score of 2 are considered borderline. We and others \nhave observed that \nmany carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 do not show gene amplification. \nAll carcinomas with \nstaining intensity scores of 2 are therefore submitted for FISH testing.

This tissue mass \nappears to comprise of some omental fat which is studded with multiple nodules of varying sizes. \nThe nodules appear to be confluent in some areas. The nodules range in size from 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm \nto 6.0 x 5.0 x 3.0 cm. These multiple nodules appear to have various consistencies. One of the large \nnodules is tan-white and firm; a section of this large firm nodule is submitted for frozen section. \nFROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS #1 \nOmentum, biopsy: tissue consistent with metastatic carcinoma of ovarian origin, with features of \nPage 2 of 4 \npapillary serous carcinoma. \nThe remainder of this frozen section specimen is subm entirely in cassette A1. \nIn addition to this large firm nodule (6.0 x 5.0 x 3.0 cm, frozen section obtained from middle of \nnodule), there are additional nodules which are slightly softer in consistency. Also present are some \nthin, fluid-filled cysts. These nodules are scattered throughout the omentum and are at the edges of \nthe resected specimen. Serial sectioning of all nodules reveal that most nodules are of the firm-white \nvariety with a few nodules being extremely soft and almost papillated on cut appearance. The thin, \nluid-filled areas when cut reveal cystic spaces filled with some clear serous fluid as well as some \npapillary regions.

A \nsmall piece of this tissue is submitted for frozen section diagnosis. \nFROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS #2 \nLeft biopsy: neoplasm, favor malignant, final diagnosis deferred. \nThe remainder of the frozen section tissue is submitted entirely in cassette B1. An additional \nrepresentative section is submitted in cassette B2. \nPart C, additionally labeled \"right ovary and tube\" consists of a large mass of soft, irregularly-shaped \nbosselated tissue measuring 7.0 x 7.0 x 3.5 cm In greatest dimension. Protruding along one edge of \nthis mass of tissue appears to be a fallopian tube which is slightly dilated in portions, especially more \ndistal. The fimbriated ends of the this fallopian tube are slightly blunted. A small, white, firm \nstructure, possibly representing an ovary is noted on the surface of this mass and measures \napproximately 2.0 x 1.0 x 0.8 cm. This mass is bisected to reveal an ovary which has been largely \nreplaced by this large soft, bosselated lesion. The remaining ovarian tissue appears to be grossly \nunremarkable. This papillary process involves the entire ovary, however, no definite ovarian source \nf origin is grossly identified.

There are multiple papillated masses on the surface. A portion of fallopian tube is identified which \nmeasures 6 cm in length and 1 cm in greatest diameter. Serial sectioning reveals that the nearly the \nentire \novarian mass consists of tan-pink, soft, friable, papillary structure. Cassette Ai contains a frozen section \nremnant. Representative sections of the mass are submitted in cassettes A2-A6. \nPart B, labeled \"right ovary\", consists of an ovary with a portion of fallopian tube weighing 83. 5 grams \nand \nmeasuring 7 x 6 x 4.8 cm. The fallopian tube measures 7 cm in length and 2 cm in greatest diameter at \nthe \nportion of hydrosalpinx. A large cyst is associated with the ovary measuring 6.5 cm in greatest diameter \nand containing clear serous flUid. The external surfaces are inked in black. The internal surface of the cyst \ncavity is smooth. A 1.3 cm nodular area beneath the cyst wall is visible in the region of the adherence of \nthe \nfimbriae to the ovary. Sections through this region reveals a mass which is contiguous with the internal \nsurface of the fallopian tube obstructing the distal orifice. This mass measures 1.7 cm in greatest \ndiameter. \nA section of this area is submitted in cassette B1. Two irregularly-shaped white fibrous-appearing areas \nare \nalso beneath the internal cyst wall; each measuring <1.5 cm in greatest diameter.

The patient undergoes exploratory laparotomy, total abdominal \nhysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy, appendectomy, tumor debulking and \nrectosigmoid resection with a primary anastomosis. \nGross Description \nThe specimen is received fresh in thirteen parts, each labeled with the patient's name and medical record \nnumber. \nPart A is additionally labeled \"omentum.\" It consists of a single fragment of omentum, measuring 22 x 18 \nx \n3 cm. The omentum is studded with multiple white-pink nodules, ranging in size from 0.2 cm to 5.0 cm. A \nrepresentative section is submitted for frozen section diagnosis as FS1, with the frozen section remnant \nsubmitted in cassette A1. An additional representative section is submitted in cassette A2. \nPart B is additionally labeled \"uterus, cervix, ovaries and tubes plus tumor.\" It consists of a single \nhysterectomy specimen weighing 800 grams and measuring 14 cmfrom fundus to cervix, 4.5 cm from \ncornu to cornu and 9.0 cm from anterior to posterior. The cervical portion of the specimen measures 3 cm \nin length and 2 cm in diameter. The uterus is distorted by multiple firm, white-tan, whorled leiomyomata \nranging in size from 0.3-5.5 cm in average diameter. No necrosis or hemorrhage is identified in any of the \nleiomyomata. The endometrium is tan-pink and measures 0.2 cm in average thickness. The myometrium \nis distorted by the multiple leiomyomata and therefore ranges in thickness from 1.0-2.7 cm in thickness. \nThe uterus is oriented by the peritoneal reflections. Within the left adnexa, there is a 2.5 x 1.5 x 1.3-cm \nfirm, white nodule which may represent ovarian tissue. There is an additional firm, white-yellow, solid \nregion measuring 2.5 x 1. 7 x 1.0 cm which may represent tumor within the adnexa. A small segment of \nfallopian tube is identified measuring approximately 3 cm in length and 0.8 cm in average diameter. There \nare additional small, white, firm nodules which apparently represent tumor studding the adnexal tissue. \nThese nodules obscure the normal anatomy and make orientation difficult. The right adnexa contains a \nfirm, white region measuring 3.0 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm which may represent ovarian tissue. A portion of fallopian \ntube measuring approximately 4 cm in length and 0.7 cm in average diameter is present. Again, multiple \nfirm, white regions, possibly representing tumor are present within the adnexa precluding exact \nidentification of the normal anatomy. A representative section of the specimen is submitted for frozen \nsection analysis as frozen section #2, with the remnant submitted in cassette B1. Within the specimen \ncontainer, there are multiple unoriented fragments of firm, white-tan tissue representing tumor measuring \n13.5 x 13 x 4 cm in aggregate.

Adherent to the serosal surface is mesenteric fat, \nmeasuring \n10.5 x 9.0 x 3.0 cm, which is studded with abundant firm, white nodules, ranging in size from 0.2 cm to \n2.5 cm. The largest of these nodules abuts the radial surface of the colon. However, it does not appear to \ninvade the muscular wall nor the mucosa. The pericolonic fat is extensively studded with tumor, and \ntherefore, an adequate lymph node dissection cannot be performed. The specimen was received with \nstaple \nlines at each colonic resection margin. One end is inked in blue and the opposite inked in black for \nmicroscopic evaluation (no orientation was provided). A representative section of tumor is taken for \nOncotech analysis.

Representative sections are submitted in cassette H1. \nPart I, additionally labeled \"appendix,\" consists of a 4 cm in length x 0.6 cm in average diameter appendix \nwith attached yellow-brown mesoappendix. The serosal surface of the appendix is brown and glistening. \nAt the tip of the appendix, a white-brown, cirrhotic lesion is present, measuring 1.8 x 1.2 x 1 cm, \ninvolving \nthe tip of the appendix. The tip of the appendix, including the transition into the white, cirrhotic lesion, is \nsubmitted in cassettes 11-12. Representative cross-sections of the appendix and mesoappendix are \nsubmitted in cassette 13. \nPart J, additionally labeled \"small bowel mesenteric,\" consists of multiple, unoriented, white-tan tissue \nfragments measuring 1 x 1 x 0.5 cm in aggregate.

Abundant mitotic figures and apoptotic cells are seen, The findings are most likely those of \na high-grade serous carcinoma, and the large cell size with eosinophilic cytoplasm suggests the \noxyphilic variant thereof. However, the differential diagnosis can include oxyphilic variants of clear \ncell carcinoma or a high-grade endometrioid adenocarCinoma. The absence of extra-ovarian tumor \ngiven the size of the primary is also rather unusual for serous carcinoma. Serous carcinoma is \nnonetheless favored as the overall growth pattern is most consistent with this diagnosis, and areas \nwith well-developed features of either clear cell or endometrioid adenocarcinoma are not seen. \nAdditional stains were necessary to properly assess this case, and these were performed and \nevaluated with the following results: \n-WTl: Positive. \n-p53: Positive, variable intensity. \n-ER: Negative. \n-PR: Focal, patchy positive, \n-CA125: Positive. \nThe expression of WTl is most consistent with an ovarian serous carcinoma, which is also supported \nby the diffuse expression of p53 and CA125, and low-level or absent expression of PR and ER \nrespectively. Although p53 staining is diffuse, the intenSity varies more than is typical of serous \ncarcinoma. Nonetheless, the diagnosis is not excluded by this pattern. In contrast, expression of \n\u2022 'ITl and diffuse p53 argues against clear cell carcinoma, and while some PAS-positive material is \n:esent, this is diastase-resistant and therefore not compatible with glycogen. At least some of the \nmaterial is mucin and stains with mucicarmine. The expression of WTl and poor expression of ER  and PR also argue against endometrioid adenocarcinoma. \nOvarian Tumor Synoptic Comment \n1. Type of tumor: Serous carcinoma. \n2.

The external surface of the ovary \nand tube is predominantly smooth, except for a vague, ill-defined, approximately 3 cm area on the \novarian surface which is slightly irregular in texture. This area is inked in blue, and the remaining \nsurface is inked in black. Although irregular, no overt papillary excrescences are seen. In addition, \nthe fallopian tube resection margin is inked in green. The fallopian tube appears unremarkable, and \nno discrete lesions are seen or palpated, and the fimbriae are lush. The ovary is sectioned to reveal \na soft, fleshy, gray-white, almost-solid interior with an irregular, up-to-6 cm apparently necrotic \ncavity in the middle. The tumor is soft and has a grossly discernible papillary appearance. There is  also a single smooth-walled, 4 cm, unilocular cyst filled with a clear, yellow-brown fluid as well as an \nadjacent 2.4 cm, unilocular, hemorrhagic cyst. This latter cyst directly underlies the blue-inked area \nand contains multiple small papillary excrescences along the wall as well as a 1.5 cm, solid area with \na consistency similar to the rest of the bulk tumor. The fallopian tube is sectioned and appears \ngrossly unremarkable.

Gross photographs are taken. The external surface of the \novary is noted to be smooth, tan-white-gray and shiny. No surface adheSions, solid tumor or \npapillary growth, or implants are noted. The tumor capsule is intact. Upon sectioning, the cut \nsurface of this nodule appears to be yellow-orange. Sectioning of the tumor reveals 70% solid \ngrowth with 30% cystic area. The cystic area is multiloculated and contains yellow serous fluid. The \nsolid portion of the ovary is yellow, lobulated, firm, with punctate areas of hemorrhage. The cystic \nrea is also noted to contain some areas of hemorrhage. The interior of the cyst is noted to contain \npapillary excrescences. A portion of the specimen is submitted for frozen section diagnosis 1, with \nthe remnant submitted in cassette A14. The attached fallopian tube and fimbriae appear grossly \n unremarkable. However, a small, white-tan nodule measuring 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm is visible on the \nsurface of the mesosalpinx. An additional nodule measuring 0.4 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm is palpable within the \nmesosalpinx.

This type of cancer is commonly associated with ovarian and fallopian tube tumors.\n\nStage: The extent of the disease suggests a late-stage presentation, as there are metastatic lesions found in various anatomical locations, including lymph nodes, soft tissues, and abdominal organs. However, a formal staging classification is not provided in this report.\n\nGrade: The grade of the tumor is consistently reported as high grade, indicating aggressive behavior and poor differentiation.\n\nBehavior: The behavior of the tumor is malignant, with metastatic lesions found in multiple anatomical locations."

The report describes gross examination of various specimens from different sites in the patient's body.\n\nLaterality: Right (right pelvic tumor, right diaphragmatic tumor, right hemidiaphragm), Left (left peritoneal tumor), Bilateral (bilateral adnexae), and not provided for most other sites. The laterality is mentioned in the site description.\n\nHistology: Not all specimens are described in terms of histology, but high-grade adenocarcinoma is mentioned in one specimen. Adenocarcinoma is a type of cancer that starts in glandular cells and can be high or low grade depending on how abnormal the cells look under a microscope.\n\nStage: Not provided in the report. Staging of cancer requires information about the size of the tumor, whether it has spread to nearby lymph nodes, and whether it has metastasized to distant organs, which is not available in this gross examination report.\n\nGrade: High grade is mentioned in one specimen. The grade of a tumor refers to how abnormal the cells look under a microscope and can help predict how likely the cancer is to grow and spread.\n\nBehavior: Not provided in the report. Behavior refers to whether the tumor is malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous). In this report, most specimens are described as tumors, which suggests that they are likely to be malignant, but confirmation of malignancy requires microscopic examination and other diagnostic tests.\n\nIn summary, the gross examination report provides information on the site, laterality, histology (in part), grade (in part), and behavior (not provided) of various specimens from different parts of the patient's body. However, more detailed information is needed to determine the stage and confirm the behavior of the tumors."

Most of the \ngrossly evident tumor in the left adnexa appeared to be paratubal, \nrather than intratubal. Although this high-grade papillary serous \ncarcinoma extensively involves the left para tubal soft tissues/ \n/ligaments, serosal surface of the left fallopian tube, focally \ninvolves the muscular wall of the left fallopian tube and is present \nwithin the lumen and focally involves the mucosa of the fimbriated \nend of the left fallopian tube, a peritoneal primary carcinoma \nrather than a primary tubal carcinoma is favored. The tumor \nexhibits features of high-grade serous carcinoma, for the most \npart, and focallY pseudotransitional features. Growth patterns \nof tumor include papillary, glandular and solid. Tumor-associated \npsammoma bodies are present in many of the involved sites. Lympho\u00ad\nvascular invasion by tumor is present in most of the involved \nsites. Foci of tumor necrosis are present. Secondary acute and \nchronic inflammatory changes, reactive stromal changes, fibrosis, \nadhesions, and secondary reactive mesothelial proliferation are \npresent in'most of the involved sites. No metastatic tumor is \nidentified in the sampled lymph nodes. The lymph nodes do sho,\"} \nreactive lymphoid proliferation, sinus histiocytosis, foci of \nfibrosis and/or calcifications. \n=============================================================c====== \nHISTORY: Pelvic mass \nHICROSCOPIC: \nSee Diagnosis.

The \ncervical portion of the uterus is about 2.0 cm long and up to 3.5 cm in diameter. The endometrial cavity is \nabout 3.0 cm long and up to 1.5 cm in width. The endometrial mucosa has a maximum thickness of 0.1 \ncm. The muscular uterine wall has a maximum thickness of about 1.5 cm. Attached to the cervix there is \na cuff of vaginal tissue lined by tan mucosa that is up to 2.0 cm in length posteriorly, and up to O.S cm in \nlength, anteriorly. The laterality of the adnexal structures Is uncertain. The larger of the two ovaries is \n4.S x 2.S x 2.4 cm. The ipsilateral fallopian tube has fimbria at one end, is about S.O cm in length and up \nto 0.5 cm in diameter. The adjacent adnexal soft tissues measure up to about 3.0 cm in width. The \nsmaller ovary is about 2.0 x 1.S x 1.2 cm. The second fimbriated fallopian tube is 4.5 cm long and ranges \nfrom about 0.3 to 0.6 cm in diameter. \nThere are multiple semi-soft to firm tan tumor nodules involving the serosal surface of the smaller ovary \nand focally invading the cortex of the smaller ovary. These tumor deposits measure up to O.S cm in \ndiameter. There are also plaque-like and nodular aggregates of semi-soft to firm tan tumor involving tile \nadnexal soft tissues, bilaterally and the serosal surfaces of both fallopian tubes. There are friable tan \ntumor deposits amounting in aggregate to about 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm involving the parauterine soft tissues. \nNo gross tumor is seen in the uterus, including the cervical portion of the uterus, or vaginal cuff. \nThe larger ovary appears to be subtotally replaced by a moslly cystic and focally solid tumor that is about \n4.S cm in maximum dimension. The cystic neoplasm in the larger ovary is multiloculated and contains \nyellow fluid. The linings are tan-white and smooth, for the most part. There is some tan-white fibrous \ntissue in the cyst wall. The smaller ovary also shows multiple tiny to small cysts, ranging from less than \n0.1 to about O.B cm in diameter. There appears to be some concentration of cysls with some intervening \nwhite fibrous tissue over an area measuring about 1.0 em in diameter in the smaller ovary. Adhesions \ninvolving the adnexal structures and focally involving the serosa of the uterus are also noted. No gross \npathologic lesions of the endometrium or myometrium are seen.

There Is also high grade serous carcinoma in the \ncervix, right ovary, peritubal soft tissue of the left fallopian tube and detached intraluminal fragments of high grade \nserous carcinoma within the right fallopian tube. Within the endometrium, the carcinoma Invades the myometrium and \nextends to the cervical mucosa with stromal invasion. \nWhenever there Is carcinoma in the ovaries and endometrium, It can be difficult or impossible to decide whether these \nrepresent synchronous primary tumors or whether one site represents metastatic spread from another site. In this \ncase, factors that favor an endometrial primary with metastases to ovary and peritoneum include the presence of an \nIdentical mixed serous and endometrioid morphology in both locations as well as myometrial Invasion, Iymphvascular \nspace invasion and cervical extension In the uterus. However, clinical correlation Is recommended to arrive at a final \ndetermination. \nis -ho has an adnexal mass and an elevated CA 125.

A portion is frozen for FS and a\nportion of tumor retained for Tumor Repository,\" by\nFS1: Omentum, omentectomy - \"Poorly differentiated carcinoma, consistent with Mullerian\norigin,\" by\nMicroscopic Description and Comment: Poorly differentiated\nadenocarcinoma of mixed epithelial type, with endometrioid and serous differentiation, is\npresent in multiple locations. The bulk of the tumor is in the omentum which is diffusely\nreplaced,but large tumor implants are also present on the uterine serosa and on the\nsurfaces only of both ovaries. One fallopian tube is distended by a 1.5 cm nodule of tumor\ninthe lumen. Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma is present in the peritubal soft tissue\nof the other fallopian tube. Because of the history of endometrial adenocarcinoma in a\nrecent endometrial biopsy performed at an outside institution, the entire endometrium\nhas been submitted for histologic evaluation. Very focal microscopic foci of moderately\ndifferentiated adenocarcinoma of endometrioid type are present. There is no associated\nmyometrial or lymphvascular space invasion. Sections of lower uterine segment and cervix are\nfree of carcinoma. Several small leiomyomas are identified within myometrium, the largest\nmeasuring 1.5 cm.\nWhen tumor is present in multiple locations in the female genital tract it is difficult\nto determine whether tumor in one location is metastatic from another site or whether\nthey represent synchronous primary tumors. Because the bulk of the tumor in this case\nis peritoneal, and the tumor in the endometrium is microscopic and not associated with\nmyometrial or lymphvascular space invasion, I favor that these represent synchronous primary\nperitoneal and endometrial carcinomas or that the endometrial carcinoma is metastatic from\nthe peritoneum.\nHistory: The patient is ayear old woman with omental cake, abnormal ovaries and carcinoma\nof the endometrium (biopsied atpoorly differentiated\nadenocarcinoma). Operative procedure: Laparotomy; omentectomy; total abdominal hysterectomy\nand bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy; radical tumor debulking.\nSpecimen(s) Received:\nA:OMENTUM, ROUTINE\nB:OMENTUM, ROUTINE\nC:UTERUS, CERVIX,BSO\nGross Description The specimens are received in three formalin-filled containers labeled\nwith the patient's name. The first container is labeled \"omentum, FS.\" It consists of a\nportion of omental fat measuring 18 x 17 x 4 cm occupied by multiple nodules of solid tan,\nfriable focal papillary tumor. The tumor occupies the entire portion of omentum submitted.\nPage 2 of 3 Printed from Patient Name:\nDOB:\nIn addition, the container holds a cassette labeled \"FS.\" Labeled Al - FS; A2, and A3 -\nadditional sections of tumor. Jar 3.\nThe second container is labeled \"omentum #3.\" It holds multiple irregular fragments of\nomental fat occupied by multiple tumor nodules, ranging in size from 0.5 to 3 cm. The\nspecimen measures 10 x 10 x 4 cm in aggregate. Sections of tumor nodules labeled Bl. Jar 2.\nThe third container is labeled \"uterus, cervix, BSO.\" It holds a uterus including cervix\nand two detached ovaries with corresponding fallopian tube. The uterus is 50 grams and 6\nx 3.5 x 3 cm. The uterine serosa on one aspect, which appears to be the anterior aspect,\nshows a 3 x 2 cm solid and papillary tan tumor implant. The remaining uterine serosa is\nsmooth. The ectocervical mucosa is white, shiny and flat. The cervix is 2.5 cm in diameter.\nThe endocervical canal measures 2.5 cm in length and is lined by yellow, flat unremarkable\nendocervical mucosa, 1-2 mm in the greatest thickness. The endometrial cavity is 1.8 cm in\nheight and 1.5 cm in width and is lined by flat, hemorrhagic endometrium 1-2 mm in greatest\nthickness with no discrete lesions. A 1.5 x 1 x 1 cm white, firm whorled solid nodule,\nwell-encapsulated is attached to the lower uterine segment and extends into the parametrial\ntissue, grossly consistent with leiomyoma. Multiple sections of the myometrium show no\nevidence of additional tumors or invasive carcinoma. The ovaries and fallopian tubes are\nnot oriented. Each ovary measures approximately 2 x 1 x 1 cm in size. Also each of them\nshows, on its surface, towards the lateral fold a 1.5 x 1 x 1 cm polypoid with papillary\ntan tumor which appears to be a superficial implant. Each fallopian tube is 5.5 cm in length\nand 0.5 to 1.0 cm in diameter. One of the fallopian tubes shows adhesions at its fimbriated\nend and is markedly distended, filled with clear fluid, consistent with hydrosalpinx. The\nother fallopian tube is distended by a 1.5 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm solid tumor that fills the lumen\nin the middle and proximal third. Labeled Cl - anterior cervix/endocervix; C2 - anterior\nendocervix/LUS; C3 - anterior endomyometrium; C4 - tumor implant on anterior uterine\nserosa; C5 - posterior cervix/endocervix; C6 - posterior endocervix/LUS; C7 - posterior\nendomyometrium; C8 and C9 - one ovary with corresponding fallopian tube; C10 - opposite\novary with its corresponding fallopian tube; Cll-C15 - additional endomyometrium (entire\nendometrium submitted).

The tumor is present predominantly in sheets of\ncells with large vesicular nuclei and occasional tumor giant cells. In some areas the\ntumor is present in thin single file cords invading a desmoplastic stroma. Other areas show\nrhabdoid features with perinuclear eosinophilic cytoplasm. A significant minority of the\ntumor forms well-defined endometrioid-type glands. These glands appear to be present in\nan adenofibromatous stroma. Metastatic adenocarcinoma extensively involves the lymphatics\nof the myometrium but no serosal implants are present. The endometrium has been entirely\nsubmitted and exhibits a disordered proliferative pattern but no carcinoma is identified.\nThe right ovary (enitrely submitted) and both fallopian tubes are free of carcinoma.\nMetastatic adenocarcinoma is present in periappendiceal soft tissue. The appendix also\ncontains a focal mucocele but no carcinoma involving epithelium is present. Metastatic\nadenocarcinoma is present in 2 of 2 right external iliac lymph nodes, 2 of 2 right obturator\nlymph nodes, lof 2 left external iliac lymph nodes, 2 of 6 left obturator lymph nodes, 2 of\n2 right peri-aortic lymph nodes, and 1 of 1 left peri-aortic lymph nodes. One right common\niliac lymph node is free of carcinoma. Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma is present in\nPage 2 of 5 Printed from Patient Name:\nDOB:\nthe specimen labeled \"umbilical hernia and nodule. The single submitted section from the\nspecimen labeled \"small bowel mesenteric mass\"appears to represent near total replacement\nof a large lymph node. The omentum is free of carcinoma.\nGiven the somewhat unusual morphologic features immunostains were performed. The tumor is\nnegative for gross cystic disease fluid protein an antibody that stains approximately 60 to\n80% of breast carcinomas. The tumor is focally positive for S-100 and is strongly positive\nfor CA-125 in the better differentiated endometrioid areas. Although the morphologic\nfeatures and tumor distribution are somewhat unusual, in the absence of another primary\ntumor these features are consistent with a mullerian (ovarian) primary.\nhas rPiiic' selected slides and concurs with this interpretation.

Jar 1.\nComment: Papillary serous adenocarcinoma extensively involves the 25 cm right ovary and\nfallopian tube. The left fallopian tube contains a nodule of adenocarcinoma which invades\nthrough the fallopian tube wail to invade the serosal surface. Areas of fallopian tube\nepithelium adjacent to this nodule show focal in situ carcinoma. The endometrium exhibits\nseveral apparently discrete fcci of morphologically identical superficial papillary serous\nadenocarcinoma without direct myometrial invasion but with extensive lymphvascular space\ninvasion. Superficial foci of papillary serous adenocarcinoma are present in the lower\nuterine segment; one is present adjacent to high endocervix. Papillary serous adenocarcinoma\nalso involves the cul-de-sac biopsy, the omentum (five small nodules measuring 1 cm in\ngreatest dimension), one of three right obturator lymph nodes, three of five left external\niliac lymph nodes, two of three right external iliac lymph nodes, and one of one para-aortic\nlymph nodes. Three left obturator lymph nodes are free of carcinoma.\nin cases ,suchas this one, where morphologically identical papillary serous carcinoma is\npresent in multiple sites it is\niffic Lt to determine which site is the primary one or whether there are multiple primary\netes. The extensive involvement of one ovary, a eelatively discrete lesion in the fallopian\ntube with a focal area of adjacent in, situ carcinoma, and multiple foci in the endometriu:n\n.with no myometrial invasion suggest synchronous primary sites. The presence of extensive\nlymphvascular space invasion in the myometrium, however, could provide a mechanism for spead\nof an endometrial primary.\nHistory: The patient is a year old woman with a right adn.exal mass and an enlarged uterus.\noperative procedure: Examination under anesthesia, exploratory laparotomy, Octal abdominal\n..ysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectcmy, lymph node dissection, and or.entectemy.\nPage 4 of 5 Printed frorT Patient Name\nDOBa\nAn intraoperative non-microscopic consultation was obtained and interpreted as: \u00b0#1:\nPicked-up from operating room a right adrexal mass (1400 grams) measuring 25.0 cm in maximal\ndimension with attached 10.0 cm fallopian tube.

In several foci, the papillae are fused so that solid sheets of cells are seen. In \none focus in the left ovary, the tumor is composed of sheets of cells with variably cleared \ncytoplasm. These latter elements also focally exhibit spindled featuresi nonetheless, we \nregard them as most consistent with a minor clear cell component. Other foci of the tumor \nexhibit mucinous features with irregular nests, glands and clusters of neoplastic mucinous \nepithelial cells resting in mucin pools. In many of the metastatic foci, including the \ngastrocolic omentum, the rectosigmoid nodule, the bladder serosa, and in both fallopian \ntubes, this latter component is conspicuous. Irrespective of the histologic pattern that \npredominates in any given location, ps~omatous calcification in invariably present. Tumor \nis also present on the posterior serosal surface of the uterus and in the posterior uterine \nperitoneal reflection. It is possible that this tumor may have arisen in an extra-mullerian \nsite; however, despite the unusual mucinous elements in this tumor, we believe that this \nprocess is best interpreted as a primary ovarian papillary serous carcinoma with multifocal \nintraabdominal spread and lymph nodal metastasis.

The uterus contains an irregularly nodular peritoneal reflection and the left ovary has two firm greyish-white areas. There are also sections of the anterior and posterior cervix with attached vaginal tissue, as well as fragments of vaginal tissue.

The first is labelled \"uterus, \ncervix, both tubes and ovaries,\" It contains an hysterectomy \nspecimen vlith attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and \novaries. The uterus measures 8.5 x 5.0 x 4.5 em in greatest \ndimension and has a smooth, unremarkable serosal surface. The \ncervix measures 3.0 em in length and 3.0 em in greatest diameter \nand contains a circular as measuring 0.3 em in greatest diameter. \nThe uterus is bivalved in the coronal plane to show an \nunremarkable endocervical canal measuring 2.5 em in length and 0.3 \nem in greatest diameter. The endometrial cavity is smooth, \ntan-vlhite, and measures 2.0 cm x 3.0 cm. It shows a polyp \nmeasuring 3.5 x 1.4 x 0.5 cm. which appears to have filled the \nmajority of the endometrial cavity. The polyp is attached by a \nthin stalk (measuring 0.3 em in greatest diameter) to the \nposterior aspect of the endometrial cavity. The right fallopian \ntube measures 4.0 em in length and 0.5 cm in greatest diameter. It \nis densely adherent to an irregular multilobulated firm, white \nmass which is grossly suspicious for tumor and measures 3.0 x 2.0 \nx 1.5 em in greatest dimension. This mass is partially adherent to \nthe presumed normal ovary whieh measures 2.3 x 1.2 x 1.0 em. \nThe mass appears to grossly invade the fallopian tube but not the \novary. The left fallopian tube measures 4.0 cm in length and 0.5 \nem in greatest diameter. It is externally grossly unremarkable. \nHowever, on sectioning, a firm, white nodule measuring 1.5 em in \ngreatest dimension is noted directly adjacent to the tube. \nHowever, it does not grossly appear to invade the fallopian tube. \nThe left ovary is firm, yellow-white, and multilobulated, \nmeasuring 4.5 x 3.0 x 3.5 em. The ovary appears to have had tissue \nexcised prior to receipt. On cross section, the ovary is solid, \nfirm, white t'i'ith an area of central degeneration measuring 1.0 x \n2.0 x 0.5 cm in greatest dimension. The ovarian serosa is smooth \nand the tumor appears grossly contained by it.

The majority of the tumor is present \nin solid sheets and nests: Some of the tumor, however, exhibits definite glandular \ndifferentiation with occasional areas of back to back glands diagnostic of endometrioid \ndifferentiation. Other areas exhibit intraluminal complexity in the form of papilla with \nmarkedly pleomorphic nuclei and numerous atypical mitotic figures consistent with serous\u00b7 \ndifferentiation.

The left adnexa is largely \nreplaced by a 7 x 4 x 4 em friable tan tumor mass. The tumor has a finely papillary \nappearance. Attached to the tumor is a 3 em in diameter smooth-lined cyst. Grossly, the \ntumor appears to be adhesed and possibly invading the serosal surface of the left uterine \ncorpus. The fallopian tube, which meaSures 3 em in length and 1 em in diameter appears to \nbe uninvolved, although it is adherent to the tumor mass. The right adnexa consists of \na 2 x 1.5 x 0.8 ern firm white and tan ovary with multiple corpora albicans and a 4 em in \nlength and 0.8 cm in diameter fallopian tube. There does not appear to be any evidence \nof tumor in the fallopian tube or the ovary; however, in the mesovarium, there is a 0.5 \nem firm white nodule. The uterine corpus which measures 4.5 em superior-inferior, 4 cm \ncornu-cornu, and 4.5 em anterior-posterior is adhesed to the left ovarian mass. Furthermore, \nthere are multiple nodules of tumor studding the serosal surface. The endometrial cavity \nmeasures 2.5 x 2 ern with an endometrial thickness of 0.2 cm. The endometrium sounds to a \ndepth of 8 ern. The endometrial lining is remarkable for a 2 x 2 x 1 em polyp protruding into \nthe endometrial cavity. Sectioning of the pol:yp reveals a central core with a firm \\\u00b7;hite \nlobulated appearance, measuring 2 x 1.2 x 0.5 cm. The core of this polyp appears to arise \nfrom the underlying myometrium and' is consistent with a submucosal leiomyoma protruding \ninto the lumen of the cavity with an intact endometrial lining overlying the leiomyoma. \nThere are also other intramural and subserosal unremarkable leiomyomas present, ranging \nfrom 1 cm in greatest dimension to 1.6 crn in greatest dimension. The myometrium is 2,cm \nin thickness anteriorly and 1.4 cm in thickness posteriorly.

The sigmoid mesentery also contains a small amount of \npapillary serous adenocarcinoma. The ovaries and endometrium have been entirely submitted \nfor histologic evaluation. A small amount of papillary serous adenocarcinoma is present on \nthe left ovary (2 mm) and in left paraovarian soft tissue. Sections of both fallopian tubes \nshow numerous, small, detached fragments of adenocarcinoma in the lumens but no invasive \ncarcinoma is present in either tube. A single, small focus of in situ adenocarcinoma \nis present in the right fallopian tube. Sections of endometrium show a single focus of \nendometrial intraepithelial carcinoma involving a single gland (slide E14). No invasive \nserous carcinoma was present in the endometrium. The pancreatic biopsy shows a pseudocyst \nwith surrounding chronic pancreatitis and a small amount of islet cell hyperplasia. No \npancreatic carcinoma is identified. \nIn summary, I believe this case is best classified as primary peritoneal papillary serous \ncarcinoma with small foci of in-situ serous carcinoma involving the fallopian tube and \nendometrium. Others have raised the possibility that even non-invasive serous carcinoma in \nthe endometrium may be the source of extrauterine spread. \nReference: \nHistory: \nThe patient is a \nbleeding and 4 \nabdominal hysterectomy, \nPage2of5 with endometrial/ovarian carcinoma, postmenopausal \nOperative procedure: Laparotomy, omentectomy, total \nbilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, sigmoid mesentery biopsy.

The serous carcinoma Invades into the muscularis but not through the wall of the tube. There is \nalso a large amount of morphologically identical serous carcinoma involving both ovaries, the serosa of the uterus, the \nparametrial soft tissue, the omentum and a lymph node from an unspecified site. Focally the tumor in these areas \nshows cleared cytoplasm suggestive of a clear cell carcinoma component, but these areas make up much less than \n10% of the tumor. \nThe presence of in situ serous carcinoma adjacent to Invasive serous carcinoma in the left fallopian tube is strong \nevidence that there is a primary fallopian tube carcinoma.

The serosal surface of the cystic ovary is \ntan~yeltow and purple. There are a few fibrous adhesions noted on the surface of the cyst covering an area of 6 x 4 cm. \nThe inner surface of the cyst is relatively smooth and has a similar coloration as the outer surface. There is an \nIntramural, nodular thickening measuring 2.5 x 1.8 x 0.9 cm. It has been previously sectioned to reveal a yeHow~tan \nand white cut surface which is variegated. There is another thickened area of the wall of the cyst measuring 1.8 x 2.9 x \n1.5 cm. This may represent a portion of the round ligament vs residual ovary.

It appears to have been. previously ligated. The serosal surface contains a yellow-tan, nodular tumor Implant \nmeasuring 2.4 x 2.8 x 2.4 em, It is located at the distal end of the fallopian tube and Involves the fimbria. The cystic \novarian mass appears to be separate from the fallopian tube. A remnant of the ovary is not grossly identifiable. There is \nan additional segment of fal/oplan tube noted measuring 1 em in length with a diameter of 0.4 em. It has a pinpoint \nlumen and contains no lesions. Serial sectioning through the remainder of the fallopian tube reveals tumor within the \nlUmen contiguous with the previously described tumor Implant on the surface of the fallopian tube. Proximal to the \ntumor, the fallopian tube appears somewhat dilated and filled with serosanguineous fluid. The lumen measures up to \n0.6 cm in diameter. Also present within the container is a white tissue casseHe labeled \"FS1.-It contains fragments of \ntan-yellow soft tissue, measuring 2.2 x 1.5 x 0.2 cm in aggregate. \nLabeled: Al -remnant of FS1; A2 to A4, nodular thickened area of cyst wall, entirely submitted; A5, the other nodule \nlocated within the cyst wall, possibly representing round ligament; A6, probable fibrous adhesions on surface of cyst; \nA7, additional sections of cyst; AS, small segment of fallopian tube located most proximally; A9 and A 10, more proximal \nend of additional segment of fallopian tube distal to point of ligation; All and A12, cyst wall in relation to fallopian tube \nand tumor nodule on falloln tube surface; A13, tumor nodule at fimbriated end of fallopian tube; A14, cyst wall and \nparaovarian tissue. \nThe second container is labeled nright tube and ovary, uterus, and cervix.\u00b7 It contains a uterus and cervix with attached \nproximal portion of right fallopian tube. The uterus and cervix measure 7 cm from fundus to tip of cervix x 6.3 cm from \ncornu to cornu x 6 cm from anterior to posterior. The serosal surface of the uterus is tan-pink to purple. There are \npossible tumor implants noted on the posterior right aspect of the fundus, measuring 2.3 x 1.5 x 004 cm. The anterior \nand posterior fundic aspects of the uterus are nodular due to the presence of subserosal and intramural probable \nleiomyomas. The cervix measures 3.5 x 3.4 x 3.4 cm. The left and posterior parametria appear to contain tumor \nimplants, measuring up to 3.7 x 2,3 x 3 cm. A portion of the peritoneal lining over the posterior aspect of the uterus and \nparametria has been partially pulled away from the parametria and uterus. There is redundant peritoneal tissue which \nmay actually be a portion of a cystic structure which has been previously opened. The exact size of this possible cystic \nstructure cannot be determined. This portion of redundant peritoneal tissue vs cyst wall tissue measures 3 cm In \ngreatest dimension with a thickness measuring up to 0.3 cm. The ectocervix measures 3.4 x 3 x 4 em and Is tan-pink to \npurple and unremarkable. The cervical os is slit-like and measures -0.7 em, The uterus and cervix are opened to \nreveal an endometrial cavity measuring 2 x 3 cm. The endometrial cavity is somewhat deformed due to the presence of \na submucosal, probable leiomyoma within the anterior superior segment as well as other intramural and subserosal \nleiomyomas. These leiomyomas range in size from 1.5 to 3.5 em in greatest dimension. They have discrete borders \nand tan-white, whorled cut surfaces. The endometrial mucosa is tan\u00b7pink to red without lesions and measures up to 1 \nmm in thickness. The endocervical canal measures 2.7 x 0.7 cm with tan-white mucosa with a herringbone contour. \nAlso present within the container is an ovary with attached segment of fallopian tube. The presumed right ovary is \npreviously disrupted with an opening in the serosa with readily observable tumor. Though it Is rather difficult to \nreconstruct the original dimensions of the ovary, the ovary appears to measure 6 x 3.5 x 304 cm. The serosal surface is \ntan, grey, purple, and pink and yellow. There may be possible tumor implants on the serosa which measure <1 mm in \nheight. Sectioning through the right ovary reveals solid tumor making up 50% of the ovary as well as a cyst measuring \n2.5 cm in diameter. The cyst is tmed with tan-yellOW to grey, papillary excrescences along with blood. The more solid \ncomponent has a variegated, tan-grey and yellow cut surface. The right fallopian tube measures 5.4 cm in length with a \ndiameter ranging from 0.5 to 2 em at the fimbriated end. The serosal surface Is tan-grey to purple and unremarkable. \nSectioning the fallopian tube reveals a pinpoint lumen with a wall thickness measuring up to 0.2 cm. The tumor does \nnot appear to Involve the fallopian tube grossly. There are multiple paratubal cysts ranging in size from 0.4 to 0.7 cm in \ndiameter located between the fallopian tube and the ovarian mass. The cysts have a smooth inner lining and contain \nclear fluid. Also present within the container are multiple fragments of grey-tan, soft tissue fragments with ragged \nsurfaces, measuring 3.5 x 3.5 x 1.5 cm in aggregate. They are sectioned to show yellow-tan and grey, variegated cut \nsurfaces similar to the tumor previously described in other areas. There is a round, hard structure with a tan-white and \npurple surface measuring 1.2 x 0,8 x 0.8 cm. It is sectloned to show a tan-yellow, variegated cut surface. Also present \nwithin the container are fragments of possible serosal tissue vs cyst wall, measuring 3.7 x 3.5 x 0.4 cm in aggregate. \nThey are sectioned to show grey, as well as grey, yellow, variegated cut surfaces. Also present within the container is a \nfragment of yellow, maroon, and grey, fibrofatty soft tissue measuring 4.7 x 3.5 x 1 em.

Jar 2. _ \nCOMMENT \nThere is extensive involvement of both ovaries, bot fallopian \ntubes, the uterus and cervix, bladder serosa, and the omentum by \npoorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. The most ext~nsive tumor \nburden is in the ovaries, one or both of which represent primary \nsites. In the left ovary, the tumor displays two di~tinctive \nhistologic types (best demonstrated in slides LOI a d L02). In \nsome areas, the histologic pattern is distinctly en ometrioid with \nwell-formed glands displaying central lumina. The s~cond \nhistologic type, which represents the majority of t~e tumor, is \nthat of a high grade poorly differentiated adenocar9inoma, most \nlikely representing a papillary serous adenocarcino~a. Both \novaries also contain adenofibromas. It is this poorlw ' \ndifferentiated papillary serous component which rep~esents the ' \n,biologically aggreSfdv:.e_c,omponent_oL.the neoplasm,\u00b7-al ,it, is the' \n----~ sole histologic subtype in all the metastatic sites. The right \novary shows extensive invasion by poorly differentia ed \nadenocarcinoma. Both fallopian tubes contain serosal implants of \nmetastatic poorly differentiated carcinoma, as well s submucosal \ninvasion of tumor nests. While the majority of the ndometrial \nepithelium is composed of cytologically bland atroph~c glands, \nadmixed among the normal elements are islands and nehts of \nmetastatic poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma Whict is indistinguishable from the, ovarian tumor. It is not possible to \ndetermine with certainty whether the endometrial car,inoma is a \nsecond, synchronous primary or metastatic from the oyaries. The \nentire thickness of the myometrial wall displays numerous \nintravascular metastases of adenocarcinoma, and numetous uterine \nserosal implants of tumor are also seen. Extensive s' mucosal \ninvasive nests and intravascular metastases are also identified in \n--4--\n Name; -\nthe cervix. \nare also comple \nadenocarcinoma. ,. Surg'; \u00b7Path.

The tumor is described as poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, which suggests high-grade malignancy. The TNM and FIGO stages cannot be definitively assigned due to the missing information on extraovarian peritoneal metastases and lymph node evaluation; however, based on the available data, a preliminary stage of IIIC is suggested."

The mass \nmeasures 12 x 10 x 7 cm. The serosal surface ShOHS numerous bosselations. \nFocally, the capsule is ruptured and at this site the tumor is seen projecting \nto the exterior. Also identified on the ovarian surface is a possible fallopian \ntube measuring 4.5 crn in length and has a luminal diameter of 0.3 crn. The \nfallopian tube grossly appears uninvolved. Further sectioning of the ovarian \nmass shows a tan-yellow firm tumor mass which is solid in most part, but focally \nshows cystic change and the inner surface of the cyst wall shows papillary \ntan-white projections. Labeled A1 -possible right fallopian tube; A2 to All -\nsections through the right ovarian tumor. II1II-----. \nThe second container is labeled IIleft adnexa.\" It contains portions of \nfallopian tube and with attached tan-yelloH ovarian mass. The fallopian tube \nmeasures ~.O x 1.1 x 0.8 cm, and the attached ovarian mass measures 6.0 x 6.5 x \n4.0 cm. The mass weighs 60.5 grams. Sections through the fallopian tube show \nportions of the serosal surface involved by the tumor, hOHeverl the mucosa \nappears uninvolved. Part of the ovarian surface appears ragged, while part of \nthe ovarian surface is smooth and ShovlS multiple tan-yellow papillary \nexcrescences on the surface. Based on the gross examination, it is not possible \nto discern the primary site of the tumor (left ovary vs right ovary). Further \nsectioning of the ovary reveals multiple nodular tan-yellow solid and papillary \ntumors with focal areas of necrosis. Labeled Bl -sections through the \nfallopian tube with the tumor at the serosal aspect; B2 to B8 -random sections \nthrough the ovarian tumor ........ \nThe third container is labeled \"bladder.\" It contains three tan-yelloVl to \ntan~pink fat and soft tissue fragments ranging from 2.0 to 5.0 cm in greatest \nPage 2 of 4  dimensions and 5.0 x 5.0 x 2.0 em in aggregate.

The largest fragment shows multiple \ntan-white nodules that are matted together to form the omental cake. Sections \nof the mass show tan-whi tumor masses dissecting into the omental \nstroma. Labeled D1 to D4. \nThe fifth container is labeled \"uterus.\" It contains a uterus and cervix \nweighing 165 grams, and measuring 10.0 x 8.0 x 7.0 em. The uterus is bivalved \nwhen received. The serosal surface is tan-pink and shows multiple tan-yellow \nnodules with consistency and cut surface similar to the lesions noted in both \nthe ovaries, and is grossly consistent for serosal implants. The serosal \nimplants range from 0.6 to 4.0 em in greatest dimensions. The uterus is further \nsectioned to show a 2.5 em unremarkable endocervical canal. The endometrial \ncavity measures 3.5 x 2.2 cm. A fundal, calcified intramural leiomyoma is \nidentified and measures 3.8 ern in greatest dimensions. The endometrial cavity \nis unremarkable, and does not show any involvement by the ovarian tumor. \nLabeled E1 -posterior cervix with endocervical canal; E2 -posterior lower \nuterine segment; E3 -possible posterior endometrium; E4 -myometrium with \nadjoining serosal tumor implant; E5 -anterior cervix with endocervical canal; \nE6 -possible anterior lower uterine segment; E7 -possible anterior \nE8 and E9 -sections through the serosal implant invading into the \none-third section through the leiomyoma.

        "llm_output": " Site: The specimen contains lesions from various sites including the right pelvic wall, right and left ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, and multiple lymph nodes.\n\nLaterality: The laterality of most lesions is on the right side, including the right pelvic wall, right ovary, right fallopian tube, and right-sided lymph nodes. However, there are also lesions in the left ovary, left ovarian hilum, and left-sided lymph nodes.\n\nHistology: The specimen shows various histologic types of lesions, including serous carcinoma, fibroepithelial lesion, and unremarkable lymphoid tissue. The most significant finding is a poorly differentiated papillary serous carcinoma in the right pelvic wall and right ovary.\n\nStage: The stage of the cancer is not explicitly provided; however, based on the description of the lesions' extent and involvement of lymph nodes, it can be inferred that the cancer is at an advanced stage.\n\nGrade: The grade of the cancer is also not explicitly provided; however, based on the description of the lesion as \"poorly differentiated,\" it can be inferred that the cancer is high-grade.\n\nBehavior: The behavior of the cancer is malignant, as evidenced by its extensive spread and involvement of lymph nodes.\n\nJustification: These six categories are chosen because they provide critical information for understanding the nature and extent of the lesions in the specimen. Site and laterality describe the location of the lesions, which can have implications for treatment and prognosis. Histology provides information about the type and differentiation of the lesion, which is crucial for determining the appropriate treatment and assessing the prognosis. Stage and grade are important indicators of the extent and severity of the cancer, respectively, while behavior describes whether the lesion is benign or malignant."

There is one confluent nodule of \ntumor situated in the ovarian hilum and medulla. While it is \ndifficult to be absolutely dogmatic when tumor is as widespread as \nin this case, the distribution favors a primary in the fallopian \ntube. Additional foci of tumor are identified on the serosal \nsurface of the uterus where there is rrdnimal involvement of \nadjacent myometrium. Small foci of tumor are identified on the \nserosal surface of ,the left ovary and fallopian tube. There is \nrrdnimal involvement of the left tubal fimbria. The endometrium is \nlargely atrophic.

Longitudinal sectioning of the nodule \nreveals a large mostly necrotic mass of white to yellow gritty tissue \nconsistent with tumor described in previous areas, The central core of the \nnodule appears somewhat more viable than the remainder. Representative \nsections are submitted in Blocks \nDIAGNOSIS: \nOVARIES, BILATERAL (C,D,E): SEROUS ADENOCARCINOMA, FIGO GRADE 2, WITH MASSIVE \nPSAMMOMA COMPONENT (PSAMMOMOCARCINOMA), WITH MASSIVE METASTASES INVOLVING \nOMENTUM (A), CECUM (B), RIGHT FALLOPIAN TUBE (C), UTERUS (E), LEFT FALLOPIAN \nTUBE (E), RECTOSIGMOID REGION (F). \nSUBMITTED AS UTERINE FIBROID (G): THE ENTIRE SPECIMEN CONSISTS OF METASTATIC \nSEROUS ADENOCARCINOMA. \nENDOMETRIUM (E): A SMALL FRAGMENT OF TUMOR IS PRESENT IN THE ATROPHIC \nENDOMETRIUM. WHILE PART IS HIGHLY CILIATED, RAISING THE POSSIBILITY OF A \nSEPARATE PRIMARY, MUCH RESEMBLES THE TUMOR IN THE OVARY, FOR WHICH REASON THE \nENDOME,RIAL TUMOR IS CONSIDERED TO BE \nADDENDUM 1: \nImmunostaining for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is performed on sections \nfrom Block Al (\"omental cake\") and Dl (llportion left ovary!!). The \nimmunostaining is done using DAKO rabbit anti-human CEA which is lithe purified \nimmunoglobulin fraction of rabbit antiserum\" ( ). The \nsection from Block Al contains abundant adenocarcinoma with numerous psammoma \nbodies. There is very heterogeneous staining for CEA. There are foci of \ntumor in which all of the cells stain for CEA. Approximately 3/4 of these \ncells have moderately intense staining and 1/4 have markedly intense \nstaining. These foci where all of the tumor cells stain comprise only a small \nportion of the tumor. The more common pattern of staining is where there are \nmixtures of positively staining and negatively staining cells adjacent to each \nother. In these areas, approximately 2/3 of the tumor cells stain \npositively. The staining intensity is evenly distributed between mildly \nintense and markedly intense in these areas. Though there is great \nvariability in staining for CEA from one region of the tumor to the other, I \nestimate that approximately 50% of the tumor cells exhibit some degree of \nstaining for CEA. \nThe histological sections of the left ovary also contain abundant tumor for \nevaluation. As with the metastasis to the omentum, the primary tumor exhibits \nmarked heterogeneity in staining for CEA. There is one area of the tumor \nwhere there is necrotic debris and neutrophils between clusters of cancer \ncells. The debris and neutrophils stain positively which is a common \ncross-reaction with this antibody. There is more abundant staining of the \ntumor than was noted in the metastasis. There are many areas in which there \nare positively staining cells adjacent to negatively staining cells. There \nare also areas of the tumor in which many positively stained cells are \nadjacent to each other. The intensity of the tumor cell staining varies \nwidely, as was noted in the metastasis. Approximately 40% of the positively \nstaining cells exhibit markedly intense staining, 40% exhibit moderately \nintense staining and 20% exhibit mildly intense staining. Overall, I estimate \nthat approximately 50% of the tumor cells exhibit expression of \ncarcinoembryonic antigen. \nI certify that I personally conducted the diagnostic evaluation of the above \nspecimen(s) and have rendered the above diagnosis(es). -29-1690 \n",

The test is performed at the request of ............... \nIrnmunostaining for HER2/neu (c-erbB-2) oncoprotein is performed on recut \nsections of block A2 (\"left ovaryll). The irrununostaining is done using DAKO \nrabbit anti-human c-erbB-2 oncoprotein which is an affinity-isolated antibody \n{DAKO product number A0485}. The irnmunostaining is performed after antigen \nretrieval by heating the unstained sections at 95 degrees centigrade for 20 \nminutes in 10 roM citrate buffer, pH 6.0. The primary antibody is used at a \ndilution of 1:1500 (manual staining) or 1:2000 {autostainer}, with an \nincubation for one hour at 37 degrees centigrade. The Histostain Plus kit \n(Zymed Laboratories) is used as the detection system. The histological \nsection consists predominantly of serous adenocarcinoma with areas of \npapillary differentiation. The tumor has a variable immunostaining profile. \nThe majority of the tumor has negligible staining of the cytoplasm or cell \nmembrane (score = 0). There is a minority population of the tumor cells that page 2 on  has trace staining of the cytoplasm with mildly to moderately intense \ncircumferential staining of the cell membrane. These cells with \ncircumferential cell membrane staining are present as multiple foci scattered \nthroughout the tumor. This makes it difficult to estimate the overall tumor \npopulation with the staining pattern indicative of weak overexpression of \nHER2/neu oncoprotein, but I estimate that such cells account for approximately \n5% of the tumor cells. \nIn summary, the serous adenocarcinoma present in the left ovary has a \nsubpopulation of tumor cells (approximately 5% of the total population) with \nan imrnunostaining profile indicative of mild overexpression of HER2/neu \noncoprotein. \nI certify that I personally conducted the diagnostic evaluation of the above \nspecimen(s) and have rendered the above diagnosis(es). \n-!-W91 ",
