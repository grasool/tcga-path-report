Within the right colon there is a 4.2 x 4 cm endophytic tumor with raised rolled\nborders. This tumor is 9 cm from the distal margin and 24.5 cm from the proximal margin. The tumor invades into and through\nthe bowel wall into the pericolonic fat and is grossly 3 cm from the circumferential soft tissue margin. The tumor also appears to\nnear the serosa/peritonealized surface of the attached fat. There is an additional 4 x 3 cm polypoid mass 4.5 cm from the distal\nmargin and 29 cm from the proximal margin. The mucosa and wall adjacent to this mass is ragged, disrupted and hemorrhagic\nwith hemorrhage and necrosis in the surrounding pericoloic soft tissues. No gross invasion beyond the wall is noted and this\nmass is 6 cm from the circumferential soft tissue margin. Within the cecum there is an additional 4.5 x 2.7 x 1.8 cm exophytic\npolypoid mass. This mass is 17 cm from the distal margin and 22 cm from the proximal margin. Again, no invasion through the\nwall is noted and the mass is 9 cm from the circumferential soft tissue margin. The remaining colonic mucosa is tan-pink with\nseveral additional smaller, up to 0.6 cm, mucosal polyps and focal areas of congestion. The ileal mucosa is tan-pink with a few\npolypoid projections and a 2.3 x 1.3 cm flat granular area 6 cm from the proximal margin and 27 cm from the distal margin. No\ninvasion into the mesenteric fat is noted and the lesion is 3.5 cm from the mesenteric resection margin. The cut surfaces of the\nappendix display a lumen lined by congested mucosa. Multiple lymph nodes are identified in the attached fat. Representative\nsections are submitted as labeled: A-C tumor in ascending colon to pericolonic fat and serosal/peritonealized surface; D-E distal\nascending colon polypoid mass with adjacent ragged hemorrhagic disrupted area; F-G cecal polypoid mass; H smaller colonic\nmucosal polyps; I flat and granular irregular area in small bowel; J small bowel mucosa with small polypoid projections; K distal\nmargin and en face circumferential soft tissue margin; L proximal margin and appendix; M six lymph nodes; N six lymph nodes;\n0 six lymph nodes; P six lymph nodes.\nCPT CODE( S): ICD-9 CODE(S):\n88342 x4, 88309 , 8721 [1539]\nEND OF REPORTFACILITY:\ncrlterla\nDiagnosis DiscrepancyYes\nPrimary Tumor Site Discrepancy\nCase is (circle):Prior Malignancy History\nDual/Synchronous Primary NeiHIPAA Discrepancy\nReviewer Initials9",

Received fresh in a container labeled \"colon\" is a \n             segment of colon 23 cm long.  The specimen is received open \n    at both ends, which are arbitrarily inked blue and black.  The \n    serosal surface is tan- pink and glistening.  There is abundant \n    attached yellow adipose tissue.  There is also abundant omentum \n    present, 42 x 5 x 3 cm in greatest dimensions.  The omentum is \n    serially sectioned, and there are no focal lesions.  The segment of \n    bowel is opened.  It averages 6.5 cm in circumference.  5.5 cm from \n    the black- inked end of the specimen, there is a 5.5 x 5 x 3.8 cm \n    tumor mass.  On cut surface, this tumor grossly invades into, and \n    apparently through, the muscularis propria, into surrounding soft \n    tissues.  Although extending near to the serosal surface, tumor does \n    not appear to reach the serosal surface, and is not near the radial \n    margin.  The surface deep to the tumor is inked.  3.5 cm from the \n    blue- inked margin is a separate 3.5 x 3.3 x 2.7 cm polypoid lesion. \n    There is some black tattooing in this region.  On cut surface, the \n    polypoid lesion is exophytic, without definite gross invasion into \n    the bowel wall.

Received fresh in a container labeled \"sigmoid colon\" \n             is a 24 cm long segment of colon, which is received open at \n    one end, which is inked black black, and which is stapled at the \n    opposite end, which is inked blue.  It is 5 cm in circumference at \n    the open end of the specimen, and 9 cm in circumference at the \n    stapled end of the specimen.  The serosal surface is generally \n    tan- pink and glistening, with an area with tattoo pigmented 11 cm \n    from the open end of the specimen.  There is a palpable mass within \n    the bowel in this area, although there is not gross tumor \n    penetration to the serosal surface.  The specimen is opened, \n    revealing a near circumferential 7.5 x 6.5 x 1.5 cm mass lesion, \n    coming to within 4.5 cm of the open end of the specimen.  On cut \n    suface, there is invasion of tumor through the full thickness of the \n    bowel wall and into the surrounding adipose tissue, but the tumor is \n    not near the radial margin.  The mucosa away from this area is area \n    is tan- pink and glistening, with multiple polyps, ranging from 0.3 \n    cm to 0.7 cm in greatest dimension.  There is no other worrisome \n    lesion in the bowel.  The adipose tissue is dissected, and multiple \n    soft tan- pink lymph nodes are identified.  RS- 16, according to the \n    accompanying block summary, following fixation. \n \n    BLOCK SUMMARY:  A1 - proximal and distal resection margins; A2- A6 - \n    polyps; A7 - radial margin; A8- A10 - tumor; A11- A15 - lymph nodes, \n    h multiple lymph nodes per block; A16 - one sectioned lymph node. \n     \n \n             B.  Received fresh in a container labeled \"segment for \n             liver lesion\" is a wedge- shaped portion of tissue, with a \n    generally tan glistening capsular surface, but with an area of \n    tan- white discoloration on the capsular surface, and with the \n    non- capsular surface of the biopsy irregulary roughened and \n    cauterized.  The specimen spans an area 2 x 1.5 x 1.1 cm.  On cut \n    surface there is a nodular area approximately 0.6 cm in greatest \n    extent in the subcapsular region, corresponding to the discoloraton \n    noted on the capsular surface.

A  palpable area \n    of induration is noted.  The omentum overlying the area is focally \n    retracted and subsequently inked orange.  The pre- serosal surface in \n    the vicinity of the palpable mass is inked black.  The undesignated \n    margins measure 6.0 and 6.5 cm. in circumference respectively.  Upon \n    opening, there is a circumferential 10.5 x 9.5 cm. focally necrotic \n    glistening tan- pink tumor mass which is 9 cm. from the larger \n     circumference margin.  On sectioning, the tumor has a maximal \n    thickness of 2.4 cm. grossly extending through the muscularis to \n     within 0.15 cm. of the inked pre- serosal surface (block 4) and \n    adherent omentum (see blocks #2 and 3).  A portion of tumor and a \n    portion of normal mucosa are submitted for tissue procurement as \n    requested.  A pedunculated 1.2 x 0.8 x 0.6 cm. tan pink- red polyp is \n    present within 2 cm. of the margin of the tumor mass (between the \n    tumor mass and the larger circumference margin).  The remaining \n    mucosa is unremarkable glistening tan- pink with regular folds and \n    the wall averages 0.7 cm.  A single shallow \n    diverticulum is also identified.  Several soft to slightly rubbery \n    mucoid- appearing tan- white tissues in keeping with lymph nodes \n    measuring up to 1.3 cm. in greatest dimension are recovered from the \n    attached mesocolon. \n    Representative sections are submitted in fifteen (15) blocks as \n    labeled:` \n    ` \n    BLOCK SUMMARY:  #1 - Undesignated margins (smaller circumference \n    margin inked \n    blue larger, circumference margin closest to tumor inked green); 2,3 \n    - tumor \n    to inked indurated omentum; 4 - tumor to inked free radial serosal \n    surface; 5 \n    - central tumor; 6 - tumor to normal mucosa; 7,8 - bisected polyp \n    (1/2 per \n    cassette); 9,10 - random from remainder of specimen; 11 - eight (8) \n    whole \n    lymph nodes; 12,13 - seven (7) whole lymph nodes per cassette; 14 - \n    six (6) \n    whole lymph nodes; 15 - one (1) bisected lymph node.        \n  \n  \n \n           B.

The specimen is partially covered with pink-tan, smooth and\nglistening serosa. Externally, there is a focus of adhesions, 4 x 3\ncm., located 3.5 cm. from the nearest luminal margin (inked black).\nThe mucosa is pink-tan, smooth and glistening, with normal to\nabundant folds, and average circumference of 6 cm. There is a 4 x\n3.5 cm. ulcerated tumor, 3.5 cm. from the nearest luminal margin\n(inked black), and contiguous with the focus of serosal adhesions.\nThis focus of adhesion is inked blue. The tumor shows gross\ninvasion into the muscularis propria, and appears to penetrate\nthrough the fat, to within 0.3 cm. of the surgical margin of the\nadhesion. The focus of the radial margin is grossly unremarkable.\nThe remainder of the mucosa is pink-tan, smooth and glistening, with\ntwo polypoid lesions, 0.3 cm. in greatest dimension, located within\n2 cm. of the black inked margin and 5.5 cm. of the blue inked\nmargin. These show no gross invasion. Lymph nodes are identified\nin the fat. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted as\nfollows:\nBLOCK SUMMARY: 1- Representative luminal margins; 2 - polyps, full\nthickness; 3-5 - representative sections of tumor, including\nrepresentative to normal and representative to surgical margin; 6 -\nsix possible lymph nodes, with representative cross sections of\nvasculature; 7 - nine lymph nodes; 8 - seven lymph nodes; 9 - three\nlymph nodes. RS-9\nB.Received in formalin, labeled \"distal margin\", is a 1.5\ncm. long portion of annular tissue, which is stapled at one\nend and opened at the opposite end. The staples are irregular.

Some \nfoci consist predominantly of adenocarcinoma with only a small \namount of residual lymphoid tissue present and these are counted as \nlymph nodes totally replaced by tumor. Seventeen of 20 lymph nodes \nare positive for metastatic carcinoma. In addition, multiple foci of \nIymphovascular space invasion are present within the mesentery. The \ncarcinoma is an adenocarcinoma with focal mucinous component. The \nmucinous component is less than 50% of the tumor and, therefore, \nthis does not qualify as a mucinous/colloid adenocarcinoma. Clinical \ncorrelation and followup is recommended. \nAt the request of the undersigned pathologist, these slides have  been additionally reviewed by Dr .... who concurs with the \ndiagnosis. \n",

Received fresh and subsequently fixed in formalin labeled \"uterus\ntubes and ovaries\" is a 294 g, supracervically amputated uterus which\nis 7.5 x 7.5 x 7.5 cm. The specimen is partially covered pink-tan\nsmooth glistening serosa showing 3 subserosal fibroid ranging from 1.3\ncm to 4.5 cm in greatest dimension. Amputation site is inked. The\nspecimen has attached bilateral fallopian tubes which are both\nfimbriated measuring 8.0 x 0.7 cm. The ovaries are also present\naveraging 3.2 x 1.7 x 1.4 cm and are pink-tan and cerebriform with a\npink-tan cystic and mottled cut surface. No papillary excrescences are\ngrossly identified. The specimen is opened show smooth glistening\nendometrium with an average thickness of 0.2 cm. The specimen is\nsectioned to show multiple intramural fibroids which range from 0.1 cm\nto 5.5 cm in greatest dimension. Due to the nodular distortion of the\nspecimen, average thickness of the myometrium cannot be grossly\ndetermined. Possible cystic spaces may be grossly identified subjacent\nto the endometrium a 1.2 cm area. This is located within 2.8 cm of the\namputation site. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted\nas follows: AFS 1 representative section of endometrium and myometrium\n,1 - representative section of amputation site 2 - 3 - representative\nendomyometrium with subjacent fibroid and area of cystic spaces, 4 -\nare present at section of 2 smaller subserosal fibroids, 5 -\nrepresentative section of large subserosal fibroid, 6 - 8 -\nrepresentative section of largest intramural fibroid, 9 -\nrepresentative right ovary, 10 - representative left ovary, 11 -\nrepresentative right fallopian tube with entire fimbria, 12 -\nrepresentative left fallopian tube with entire fimbria. RS 12\nB. Received fresh and subsequently fixed in formalin labeled \"rectum\nand sigmoid\" is a 26.5 cm long portion of rectosigmoid colon which is\npartially covered with abundant yellow lobular fat and pink-tan smooth\nglistening serosa. Retroperitoneal reflection is located 8.5 cm from\nthe distal end which is inked black. The specimen is opened to show a\n5.5 x 4.8 x 0.8 cm exophytic tumor coming within 1.9 cm of distal\nmargin. The cut surface of the tumor shows invasion into the muscularis\npropria but shows no discrete invasion into the fat. This comes within\n2.5 cm or greater of the radial margin. The remainder of the mucosa is\npink-tan smooth glistening with an average circumference of 5.5 cm\nshowing no other discrete gross lesions identified.

In some area, the tumor cells contain abundant mucin vacuoles with a signet\u00b7ring \nappearance. However, individual infiltrating signet~ring calls are not seen. In other areas, the tumor cells form nests or \ntrabeculae with irregular to angular nuclei and visible nucleolI. Although the lat1ar component taises the possibility of \nneuroendocrine difforentiation, immunostain$ for the neuroendocrine markers synaptophysin and ciiiiiiromo ranin are both \nnegative. Therefore, this tumor j:;; best characterized as moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, las \nreviowod this, easo \"\"? agreed with the diagnosis. \nSYNOPTIC\u00b7 PRIMAR.Y COLON AND RECTAL TUMORS \nA \nB Lucatlon. 2 \n1 Ileocecal Region \n2.

This corresponds to the operative report describing dense tumor \ninfiltrating the pelvic sidewall over the iliac vess!,ls, through whiCh the surgeon cut. In addition, immunohistochemical \nstains reveal the carcinoma to be strongly positive for cytokeratin 7 with only focal positivity for cytokeratin 20.

In summary, the overall \nmorphological findings and immunohistochemical profile are not typical of a primary colorectal adenocarcinoma. A \npossible primary site compatible with the immunomorphologlcal findings is the pancreaticobiliary system. Alternatively, \nif another potential primary site cannot be found clinically, this could be a primary peritoneal adenocarcinoma with \nextension into the colonic wall.

        "llm_output": " Based on the given microscopic description, here is the information categorized under Site, Laterality, Histology, Stage, Grade, and Behavior:\n\n1. Site: The site is not explicitly mentioned in the description, but based on the mention of alveolar formation, it could be a lung or breast tissue. However, without more context, this cannot be confirmed.\n2. Laterality: The laterality of the tumor is also not provided in the description.\n3. Histology: The tumor shows features of sarcomatous differentiation, with round and spindle cells present. There is also mention of keratin secretion, suggesting squamous differentiation. Therefore, the histological type could be a carcinosarcoma or a mixed malignant tumor with both epithelial and mesenchymal components.\n4. Stage: The stage of the tumor is not explicitly mentioned in the description, but based on the presence of necrosis, lymphocytic infiltration, vascular invasion, and fibrosis, it is likely to be an advanced-stage tumor.\n5. Grade: Based on the mention of nuclear atypia, hyperchromatism, and mitotic activity, the tumor appears to be high grade (III).\n6. Behavior: The behavior of the tumor is malignant, as indicated by its invasive features and high-grade morphology.\n\nIn summary, based on the microscopic description provided, the tumor is likely to be a high-grade carcinosarcoma or mixed malignant tumor located in the lung or breast, with advanced stage and malignant behavior. However, without more context and clinical information, this interpretation should be considered preliminary."

        "llm_output": " Based on the given pathology report, the relevant categories with available information are:\n\nSite: The tissue sample is from a distant metastasis; however, the primary site or organ is not specified in the report.\n\nLaterality: The report does not mention whether the metastasis is on the left or right side of the body.\n\nHistology: The histological diagnosis is not explicitly stated in the report, but there are descriptions of various cell types and structures, such as squamous cells, glandular cells, spindle cells, and mosaic pattern, among others.\n\nStage: The pathological staging is provided as pT y N0 M0, which indicates that the tumor (T) is limited to its original location without invasion into nearby structures (pT y), there are no cancer cells in nearby lymph nodes (N0), and there are no distant metastases (M0).\n\nGrade: The report does not provide a clear nuclear grade or differentiation grade for the tumor. However, it mentions some features suggestive of higher-grade malignancy, such as aniso nucleosis, hyperchromatism, and mitotic activity.\n\nBehavior: Based on the available information, the behavior of this tumor is likely to be malignant, given its metastatic nature and some high-grade features. However, a definitive assessment cannot be made without more complete information.\n\nIn summary, the report provides limited information for categorizing the tumor's site, laterality, histology, stage, grade, and behavior. Further investigation and testing are required to make a comprehensive diagnosis."

Histology: Diffuse cell distribution with mosaic, storiform, and clusterized patterns; squamous, glandular, round, lymphomatous, spindle cells; keratin secretion; and other features can be found (based on the 'Primary Tumor' section).\n4. Stage: Pathological staging is given as pT3 N0 M0, which corresponds to a primary tumor invading beyond the subserosa or into nearby organs/structures without regional lymph node metastasis and no distant metastasis.\n5. Grade: Not explicitly mentioned in the fragment; however, nuclear atypia is described as \"Nuclear Atypia: 0 I II III\" which could be used to infer a grade if more information was provided.\n6. Behavior: The behavior of this tumor cannot be definitively classified based on the given fragment.\n\nJustification: The interpretation is based on extracting relevant details from various sections of the pathology report, including 'Primary Tumor', 'Pathological Staging', and 'Microscopic Description'. However, many crucial pieces of information are missing or incomplete, making it challenging to provide a comprehensive assessment."

Thorough sectioning show that the tumor    \n       appears to be limited to the muscularis propria without invasion beyond the \n       muscle. There is 2nd tan polypoid mass , located 1.5 cm from the tumor which\n       is sampled. The remaining mucosa is grossly unremarkable.

The specimen is received fresh, labeled \"total abdominal colectomy\" and         consists of a segment of terminal ileum, cecum with attached appendix and   \n       colon.  The terminal ileum measures 11.0 cm in length and 4.2 cm in         \n       circumference at the proximal resected margin.  The remaining colon measures\n       96.0 cm in length with a circumference of 6.0 cm at the distal resected     \n       margin.  The attached appendix measures 8.0 cm in length and averages 0.7 cm       in diameter.  The appendiceal and intestinal serosa is pink tan and smooth. \n       Focally hemorrhagic lobulated yellow tan adipose tissue spans the length of \n       the specimen measuring up to 1.3 cm in thickness.  The specimen is opened to\n       reveal a mass lesion measuring 3.0 cm in length and 2.6 cm in width. The    \n       mass is located in the ascending colon, 16.1 cm from the proximal margin and        89.0 cm from the distal margin. Sectioning shows that the tumor invades    \n       into the muscularis propria. The depth of invasion is 0.9 cm grossly.  The  \n       are two polyps measuring  0.2 and 0.7 cm in the transverse colon.           \n       Diverticula and muscle wall thickening are present in the distal 14.0 cm of \n       the colon.  The remaining mucosa is grossly unremarkable. The attached             adipose tissue is thoroughly examined and all identified lymph nodes are    \n       submitted.

Laterality: Not provided, as the report does not mention whether the tumor is right-sided or left-sided.\n3. Histology: Adenocarcinoma, based on the immunohistochemical staining for DNA mismatch repair proteins.\n4. Stage: Not provided, as the report does not include information about the stage of the tumor.\n5. Grade: Also not provided, as there is no information about the differentiation or growth rate of the tumor.\n6. Behavior: Malignant, based on the fact that it is a carcinoma and has abnormal MSH2 and MSH6 protein expression.\n\nJustification: The report mentions immunohistochemical staining for DNA mismatch repair proteins, which is typically performed for colorectal cancers, and identifies the tumor as an adenocarcinoma. Additionally, the abnormal protein expression suggests a malignant behavior. However, the specific site, laterality, stage, and grade are not provided in the report."

The specimen is received fresh and is labeled \"Sigmoid colon\". It       \n       consists of a 18.2 cm in length and a 5.5 cm in circumference of                   rectosigmoid colon. The serosa is glistening, smooth, tan-pink. The serosal \n       surface is inked black and the specimen is opened to reveal a 5.3 (l) x 5.5 \n       (w) cm, well-circumscribed, centrally cavitated and necrotic, serpiginous   \n       bordered, sessile mass,  located 9.5 cm from the (probable) distal margin,  \n       occupying the full circumference of the lumen (designated Mass #1).  Serial        sectioning reveals Mass #1 to invade through the muscularis into the        \n       pericolonic fat, to a depth of  1.1 cm, which is 2.8 cm from the closest    \n       radial margin. In addition, 1.1 cm distal to Mass #1, is a 0.4 (l) x 0.4    \n       (w), well-circumscribed, smooth, homogenous tan nodule, located 3.9 cm away \n       from the distal margin (designated Nodule #1).  Sectioning reveals Nodule #1       to remain confined to the mucosa. The remaining mucosa is unremarkable. The \n       specimen is submitted for lymph node dissection. Pericolic and peri-rectal  \n       adipose tissue is thoroughly examined for lymph nodes, and all possible     \n       nodes are submitted. Representative sections are submitted. TPS is submitted\n       for Mass #1.                                                                                                                                                   \n       Summary of sections:                                                        \n       PM  (probable) proximal margin                                              \n       DM  (probable) distal margin                                                \n       RM -- radial margin                                                                M1  Mass #1                                                                 \n       N1 -- Nodule #1                                                             \n       M1N1  Mass #1 and Nodule #1                                                 \n       U -- uninvolved mucosa                                                      \n       P1 pedicle one lymph nodes                                                         BP1  bisected pedicle one lymph nodes                                       \n       P2pedicle two lymph nodes                                                   \n       BP2bisected pedicle two lymph nodes                                         \n                                                                                   \n                                                                                                                                                    \n                                                                                          2).

The specimen is received fresh, labeled \"Right colon\" and consists of a\n       segment of terminal ileum, cecum with attached appendix and ascending colon.\n        The terminal ileum measures 12.0 cm in length and 3.6 cm in circumference         at the proximal resected margin.  The remaining colon measures 14.0 in      \n       length with a circumference of 5.4 cm at the distal resected margin.  The   \n       attached appendix measures 5.8 cm in length and averages 0.7 cm in diameter.\n        The appendiceal and intestinal serosa is pink tan and smooth.  Focally     \n       hemorrhagic lobulated yellow tan adipose tissue spans the length of the            specimen measuring up to the 3.8 cm in thickness.  The specimen is opened to\n       reveal a mass lesion measuring 2.1 cm in length and 2.8 cm in width. The    \n       mass is located in the right colon,  3.8 cm distal to the ileocecal valve,  \n       17.0 cm from the proximal margin and 6.5 cm from the distal margin.         \n       Sectioning shows that the tumor invades the underlying muscularis. The depth       of invasion is 0.5 cm grossly.  The remaining mucosa is remarkable for a 0.7\n       x 0.1 to 0.4 cm sessile polyp 1.0 cm distal to the tumor.  The attached     \n       adipose tissue is thoroughly examined and all identified lymph nodes are    \n       submitted.

The specimen is received fresh, labeled \"Right colon\" and consists of a        segment of terminal ileum, cecum with attached appendix and ascending colon.\n        The terminal ileum measures 8.5 cm in length and 4.5 cm in circumference at\n       the proximal resected margin.  The remaining colon measures 29.0 in length  \n       with a circumference of 7.0 cm at the distal resected margin.  The attached \n       appendix measures 4.0 cm in length and averages 0.5 cm in diameter.  The           appendiceal and intestinal serosa is pink tan and smooth.  Focally          \n       hemorrhagic lobulated yellow tan adipose tissue spans the length of the     \n       specimen measuring up to 4.5 cm in thickness.  The specimen is opened to    \n       reveal a mass lesion measuring 3.7 cm in length and 4.0 cm in width. The    \n       mass is located in the large bowel 0.3 cm from the ileocecal valve, 11.0 cm        from the proximal margin and 24 cm from the distal margin. Sectioning shows \n       that the tumor grossly invades through the muscularis and serosa. The depth \n       of invasion is 0.3 cm grossly.  The remaining mucosa is tan-brown with the  \n       normal folds. There are multiple minute polypoid lesions on the terminal    \n       ileum mucosa. The attached adipose tissue is thoroughly examined and all           identified lymph nodes are submitted.

The specimen is received fresh, labeled \"left hemicolectomy, extended   \n       left stitch marks proximal \" and consists of a segment of colon measuring 49       cm in length with a circumference of 4.5 cm at the distal resected margin.  \n       Focally hemorrhagic lobulated yellow tan adipose tissue spans the length of \n       the specimen measuring up to 4 cm in thickness.  The specimen is opened to  \n       reveal a mass lesion measuring 3.5 cm in length and 2.2 cm in width. The    \n       mass is located 36 cm from the proximal margin and 4.3 cm from the distal          margin. Sectioning shows that the tumor invades the muscularis propria. The \n       depth of invasion is 0.5 cm grossly.  The remaining mucosa shows two small  \n       polyps measuring 0.3 cm in greatest dimensions located 17 cm proximal to the\n       tumor. The attached adipose tissue is thoroughly examined and all identified\n       lymph nodes are submitted. Representative sections of the specimen are             submitted for permanent sections and for TPS.                               \n                                                                                   \n       Summary of sections:                                                        \n       P - proximal margin shave                                                   \n       D - distal margin shave                                                            T - tumor                                                                   \n       P - polyps                                                                  \n       RS -representative sections                                                 \n       LN - lymph nodes                                                            \n       BLN - bisected lymph nodes                                                                                                                                     \n                                                                                   \n                                                                                   \n                                                                                   \n                                                                                                                                                                      \n                                                                                   \n                                                                                   \n                          ** Continued on next page **                             \n                                                                                   \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                 \n                    \n                                     \n                            \n                                                 \n                             \n                                                                                        ------------------------------------------------------------ Page 3 of 3  \n                                                                                 \n       Summary of Sections:                                                      \n       Part 1:  SP: Left colon; extended hemicolectomy                           \n                                                                                        Block          Sect.

The specimen is received fresh, labeled \"Right colon\" and consists of a  \n       segment of terminal ileum and colon with attached omentum.  The terminal    \n       ileum measures 14.5 cm in length and 3.0 cm in circumference at the proximal\n       resection margin, which is inked violet.  The remaining colon measures 26.3 \n       in length with a circumference of 6.6 cm at the distal resection margin,           which is inked orange.  The attached appendix measures 6.1 cm in length and \n       averages 0.4 cm in diameter.  The appendiceal and intestinal serosa is pink \n       and smooth.  Lobulated fatty tissue spans the length of the specimen        \n       measuring up to 5.2 cm in thickness.  The attached omentum measures 7 x 6 x \n       1.3 centimeters.  The specimen is opened to reveal a pink-tan fungating mass       measuring 3.5 cm in length and 3.1 cm in width. The mass is located in the  \n       ascending colon, 4.5 cm from the ileocecal valve, 17.8 cm from the proximal \n       margin and 16.1 cm from the distal margin. Sectioning shows a depth of      \n       invasion of 0.2 cm grossly.  A tatoo is identified adjacent to the tumor.   \n       Multiple diverticula are present. The remaining mucosa is unremarkable. The        attached adipose tissue is submitted for lymph node dissection, and all     \n       identified lymph nodes are submitted.

The remaining colon measures 70 cm in     \n       length with a circumference of 3.5 cm at the distal resected margin.  The   \n       attached appendix measures 5 cm in length and averages 0.5 cm in diameter.  \n       The appendiceal and intestinal serosa is pink tan and smooth.  Focally             hemorrhagic lobulated yellow tan adipose tissue spans the length of the     \n       specimen measuring up to 3 cm in thickness.  The specimen is opened to      \n       reveal a mass lesion measuring 4 cm in length and 5.5 cm in width. The mass \n       is located in the ascending colon,  18 cm from the proximal margin and 50 cm\n       from the distal margin. Sectioning shows that the tumor invades the                muscularis. The depth of invasion is 0.4 cm grossly.  The remaining mucosa  \n       shows numerous diverticula.  NO gross lesion is identified in the sigmoid   \n       colon.  Two possible tattoo sites are present.  One is 26 cm from the       \n       proximal margin and the other is 30 cm from the distal margin.

The specimen is received fresh, labeled \"Right hemi-colectomy\" and      \n       consists of a segment of terminal ileum, cecum and ascending colon.  The    \n       terminal ileum measures 14 cm in length and 3 cm in circumference at the    \n       proximal resected margin.  The remaining colon measures 40 in length with a        circumference of 6 cm at the distal resected margin.  The appendix is not   \n       present.  The intestinal serosa is pink tan and smooth.  Focally hemorrhagic\n       lobulated yellow tan adipose tissue spans the length of the specimen        \n       measuring up to 5 cm in thickness.  The specimen is opened to reveal a      \n       circumferential mass lesion measuring 6 cm in length and 8 cm in width. The        mass is located in the cecum, 23 cm from the proximal margin and 15 cm from \n       the distal margin. Sectioning shows that the tumor invades the fat. The     \n       depth of invasion is 1.8 cm grossly. Right underneath the mass is a 4 x 2.5 \n       x 2 cm conglomerate of five nodules with yellow/white cut surface (distance \n       from tumor surface to the deepest portion of the conglomerate is 4.8 cm).          The remaining mucosa is unremarkable. The specimen is submitted for lymph   \n       node dissection.  The attached adipose tissue is thoroughly examined and all\n       identified lymph nodes are submitted.

It        \n       consists of an unoriented segment of sigmoid colon that measures 26 x 6 cm. \n       The serosal surface is unremarkable. The radial resection margin is inked   \n       black and the specimen is opened to reveal a polypoid tumor that is located \n       2.4 cm from one margin and 21 cm from the opposite margin. The tumor               measures 2.5 cm in length and 2 cm in width. Serial sectioning reveals that \n       the tumor maximum thickness is 1.5 cm.

The specimen is received fresh, labeled \"Right colon\" and consists of a         segment of terminal ileum, cecum with attached appendix and ascending colon.\n        The terminal ileum measures 15.2 cm in length and 4.1 cm in circumference  \n       at the proximal resected margin.  The remaining colon measures 41.6 in      \n       length with a circumference of 8.2 cm at the distal resected margin.  The   \n       attached appendix measures 9 cm in length and averages 0.8 cm in diameter.         The appendiceal and intestinal serosa are pink tan and smooth. The colonic  \n       serosa has a focus of retraction and is inked black.  Focally hemorrhagic   \n       lobulated yellow tan adipose tissue spans the length of the specimen        \n       measuring up to 6 cm in thickness. There is also omentum (17.2 to 15 x 1 cm)\n       which is serially sectioned revealing unremarkable adipose tissue. The             specimen is opened to reveal a circumferential tan-pink mass measuring 3.5  \n       cm in length and 8 cm in width. The mass is located in the transverse colon,\n       immediately adjacent to a tattoo site, 32.2 cm from the proximal margin,    \n       10.3 cm from the distal margin, and 16.5 cm from the ileocecal valve.       \n       Sectioning shows that the tumor invades the muscularis. The depth of               invasion is 0.3 cm grossly; the tumor has a thickness of 0.6 centimeters.   \n       There are two tan-pink polypoidal masses (1.1 cm and 0.4 cm in greatest     \n       dimension) located 3.0 cm and 4.5 cm from ileocecal valve, respectively. The\n       remaining mucosa is unremarkable. The attached adipose tissue is thoroughly \n       examined and all identified lymph nodes are submitted.

It consists of a sigmoid colon that measures 20 CM in length and \n       five CM in diameter. The serosal surface is focally puckered and wrapped by \n       fat towards the distal aspect of the specimen. The radial serosal surface is\n       inked black and the specimen is opened to reveal an ulcerated tumor         \n       measuring 5x2x0.4 cm causing slight constriction near the proximal end.            Tumor is located 13 cm from the distal margin and 6 cm from the proximal    \n       margin. Serial sectioning reveals tumor invasion to a depth of 0.4 cm       \n       penetrating through the muscularis propria.. The remaining mucosa appears   \n       grossly unremarkable.  Pericolic and peri-rectal adipose tissue is          \n       thoroughly examined for lymph nodes, and all possible nodes are submitted.         Representative sections are submitted.

The specimen is received fresh and is labeled \"Sigmoid colon\". It      \n       consists of a portion of sigmoid colon that measures 18.5cm in length x 10.0       cm in open circumference at the distal margin. The serosal surface is pink  \n       tan and unremarkable. The radial resection margin is inked black and the    \n       specimen is opened to reveal a tumor that is located 9.0 cm from the        \n       proximal margin and 6.0 cm from the distal margin. The tumor measures 2.8 cm\n       in length and 6.5 cm in width. Serial sectioning reveals tumor extending  to       a depth of 0.7 cm,  through the muscularis and grossly approaching into the \n       underlying pericolic fat.  The tumor is 4.0 cm from the closest radial      \n       margin. The remaining mucosa shows tan-yellow grossly unremarkable mucosal  \n       folds.  Pericolic and peri-rectal adipose tissue is thoroughly examined for \n       lymph nodes, and all possible nodes are submitted. Representative sections         are submitted.

The specimen is received fresh, labeled \"Right hemicolectomy\" and       \n       consists of a segment of terminal ileum, cecum with attached appendix and          ascending colon.  The terminal ileum measures 11.5 cm in length and 3.0 cm  \n       in circumference at the proximal resected margin.  The remaining colon      \n       measures 20.0 cm in length with a circumference of 7.0 cm at the distal     \n       resected margin.  There is no attached appendix, and serosa displays a 0.7 x\n       0.5cm white ill-defined fibrotic focus of a possible previous appendectomy         site which is submitted.  The intestinal serosa is pink tan and smooth.     \n       Focally hemorrhagic lobulated yellow tan adipose tissue spans the length of \n       the specimen measuring up to 4.5 cm in thickness.  The specimen is opened to\n       reveal a papillary tumor measuring 3.0 Cm in length and 3.4 Cm in width. The\n       tumor is located distal to the cecum, 3.2cm from the ileocecal valve, 14.8         cm from the proximal margin and 15.0 cm from the distal margin. Sectioning  \n       shows that the tumor invades to a depth of 1.1cm grossly extending into the \n       muscularis.

THIS REPORT!\n",
        "llm_output": " Based on the pathology report, here are the categories with corresponding information:\n\n1. Site: The site of the cancer is the colon. This is indicated by the term \"coli\" in the diagnosis.\n2. Laterality: Not provided, as the report does not specify if the cancer occurred in a specific side or section of the colon.\n3. Histology: The histological type of the cancer is tubulopapillar adenocarcinoma. This term appears multiple times throughout the report.\n4. Stage: The cancer has metastasized to lymph nodes, as indicated by \"NO I/VIII\" and \"pN1.\" Based on the TNM staging system, this suggests a stage II or III cancer.\n5. Grade: The grade of the cancer is G2, which means it is moderately differentiated.\n6. Behavior: The behavior of the cancer is malignant, as indicated by the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma and the presence of metastases.\n\nJustification: These categories were chosen based on their relevance to understanding the nature and severity of the cancer. While laterality was not explicitly stated in the report, it can still be an important factor in determining treatment options."

        "llm_output": " Based on the pathology report, the following categories can be determined:\n\n1. Site: The colon. This is mentioned in multiple parts of the report, including the title and the description of the lymph nodes as \"LymphonoduliFs of the colon.\"\n\n2. Laterality: Not provided. There is no mention of laterality (right or left side) in the report.\n\n3. Histology: Tubulopapillary and mucinous adenocarcinoma. This is specified in the title of the report as \"parFm mucinosum coli\" and \"tubulopapillar and parFally mucinous adenocarcinoma of the colon.\"\n\n4. Stage: pT2, pNO. These designations refer to the TNM staging system for cancer, with pT2 indicating that the tumor has grown into the muscle layer of the colon but not through it, and pNO meaning that there are no cancer cells in the lymph nodes.\n\n5. Grade: G3. This indicates a high-grade or poorly differentiated tumor, which means that the cancer cells look very abnormal and are growing quickly.\n\n6. Behavior: Malignant. This is implied by the fact that the report describes an adenocarcinoma, which is a type of cancer that starts in glandular tissue and can spread to other parts of the body.\n\nJustification: The site, stage, grade, and behavior are explicitly stated or can be inferred from the report. The laterality is not mentioned, so it is marked as \"not provided.\" The histology is determined by combining the information about the parFm mucinosum coli and the tubulopapillar and mucinous adenocarcinoma."

The specimen is received fresh and is labeled \"sigmoid and upper rectum\".\n       It consists of a rectosigmoid colon that measures 15.5 cm in length and 5.4        cm in circumference. The open end indicates the proximal margin. The serosal\n       surface is intact and grossly unremarkable. The radial resection margin is  \n       inked black and the specimen is opened to reveal a tumor that is located 9  \n       cm from the proximal margin and 4.5 Cm from the distal margin. The tumor    \n       measures 1.5 Cm in length and 1.3 Cm in width. Serial sectioning reveals           tumor invasion to a depth of 0.2 Cm, which is 1.5 Cm from the closest radial\n       margin.

There\n       is a second pink-tan smooth sessile polyp measuring 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm,     \n       located 1.2 cm from the tumor, and 3.2 cm from the distal resection margin         (arbitrarily designated P2). There is a third pink-tan smooth sessile polyp \n       measuring 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm, 1.0 cm distal to the tumor, and 1.8 cm from   \n       the distal resection margin (arbitrarily designated P3). The three polyps   \n       are blocked out and entirely submitted. The tumor is sectioned to reveal a  \n       well defined pink-white extension to depth of 0.8 cm grossly not involving         the underlying fat, and 1.2 cm from the inked radial resection margin.      \n       Representative sections of the tumor are submitted.

The specimen is received fresh and is labeled \"Sigmoid and upper rectum\n       stitch marks proximal.\" It consists of a rectosigmoid colon that measures   \n       19.0 x 7.5 cm. The serosal surface is smooth. The radial resection margin is\n       inked black, and the specimen is opened to reveal a tumor that is located          12.5 cm from the proximal margin and 5.5 cm from the distal margin. The     \n       tumor measures 6.8 cm in length and 8.5 cm in width.

The distal anastomotic ring (Part 2) and proximal anastomotic ring (Part 3) are also examined.\n\nLaterality: Left side of the body is affected, as evidenced by the removal of the left-sided abdominal structures (Part 1), distal anastomosis (Part 2), and proximal anastomosis (Part 3).\n\nHistology: The tumor shows features of adenocarcinoma. This is supported by the description of glandular differentiation in the submitted report.\n\nStage: The stage of the cancer is not explicitly provided in the document, but it can be inferred based on the surgical procedure and pathological findings (e.g., depth of invasion, lymph node involvement).\n\nGrade: The tumor grade is not explicitly mentioned in the report; therefore, it remains unknown.\n\nBehavior: The behavior of this adenocarcinoma is concerning for malignancy due to its propensity for local invasion and distant metastasis. This is based on the general understanding of adenocarcinomas as potentially aggressive neoplasms."

The specimen is received fresh and labeled \"Resection of psoas and\niliacus muscle, left radical nephrectomy, left colectomy\". It consists of\na soft tissue massmeasuring 18.5 x 15.5 x 12.0 cm, a segment of colon (9.5\ncm long, 5.5 cm in circumference), left kidney (9.5 x 4.5 x 3.0 cm) with\nattached ureter (16 cm long, 0.8 cm in diameter),and a small fragment of\nmuscle tissue (5.5 x 3.0 x 0.8 cm). The specimen weighs 2033 grams in total.\nThe large soft tissue massis encapsulated by a thin layer of fibrous tissue\nthat is easily separated from the mass. The cut surface is sold, lobulated,\nsoft, variegated including tan-yellow, to yellow-white, to friable gray. The\nfriable dusky area occupies roughly 25% of the mass. The mass adheres to the\ncolon wall through its fibrous capsule without grossly invading into it. The\ncolonic mucosa is tan-pink and flat. The mass also adheres to the distal\nsegment of the ureter, spanning 6 cm, through its capsule. The ureter is not\ngrossly involved by the tumor. Sectioning of the kidney and the perirenal\nadipose tissue reveals two additional lobulated tumors, most likely\ncontiguous with the main mass,being attached to the lower pole and in the\nhilum, separated by 2.5 cm. The sizes of these nodular masses are 8.4 x 6.5\nx 3.8 and 3.5 x 3.0 x 2.0 cm respectively with homogenous tan-yellow cut\nsurface. Both are encapsulated by thin capsules. Neither of the two tumors\nis invading into the renal parenchyma. The renal parenchyma is thinned\nranging from 1.5 to 2.5 cm. The renal pelvis and calyces are mildly dilated.\nThe muscle tissue is attached to superior and posterior aspect of the\nkidney and is 2.0 cm from closest tumor. No adrenal tissue is grossly\nidentified. The specimen is photographed. Sections of the tumor and normal\nkidney and perirenal fat are submitted for TPS. Representative sections are\nsubmitted for permanent.\nSummary all sections:\nUM - distal ureteral margin and renal vascular margin\nPCM - proximal colon resection margin\nDCM - distal colon resection margin\nTi - largest tumor\nTC -T1 to colon\nTU -Ti to ureter\nM - muscle tissue\nT2 - tumor attached to lower pole\nT3 - renal hilar tumor\nT1T2fibroadipose tissue linked between two nodular areas\nT2T3section in between two nodular areas\nK random kidney\n** Continued on next page ** SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT\n------------------------------------------------------------ pave 3 of 4\n2)The specimen was received fresh ,labeled \"Small bowel\" and consists of an\nunoriented segment of small bowel measuring 37.0 cm in length and ranging\nfrom 4.0 to 7.5 cm in circumference .The serosa is pink purple focally\nshaggy with minute areas of gray -tan fibromembranous adhesions ,and minimal\nattached adipose tissue .Both ends are stapled shut.

        "llm_output": " Based on the pathology report, here are the categories you requested:\n\n1. Site: The site of the tumor is the rectum. This is mentioned in the histopathological diagnosis as \"tubular adenocarcinoma of the rectum.\"\n\nJustification: The site of the tumor is crucial for treatment planning and follow-up care.\n\n2. Laterality: Not provided. The report does not mention whether the tumor occurred on the left or right side of the rectum.\n\nJustification: Laterality is not always relevant, especially in organs like the rectum that do not have separate sides.\n\n3. Histology: The histology of the tumor is tubular adenocarcinoma. This is mentioned in the histopathological diagnosis as \"tubular adenocarcinoma of the rectum.\"\n\nJustification: Histology provides important information about the type of cancer, which can influence treatment decisions and prognosis.\n\n4. Stage: The tumor stage is Dukes B, Astler-Coller B2, pT3, pNO, and R0. These stages indicate that the tumor has penetrated the muscularis propria but has not invaded nearby organs or lymph nodes.\n\nJustification: Stage is one of the most important prognostic factors in cancer and guides treatment decisions.\n\n5. Grade: The grade of the tumor is G2, which means that it has a moderate degree of differentiation.\n\nJustification: Grade provides information about the aggressiveness of the tumor and can influence treatment decisions.\n\n6. Behavior: The behavior of the tumor is malignant, as indicated by the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma.\n\nJustification: Behavior indicates whether the tumor is benign or malignant, which has important implications for treatment and prognosis."

The staples closing the proximal and distal ends are removed, and the colon \nis opened to reveal a circumferential tumor 4 cm in length, 6 cm in circumference, and 2.3 cm maximum \nheight. The tumor is centrally ulcerated with heaped-up borders that are approximately 1 cm. above the mucosal surface.  The tumor is 9.5 cm. from the proximal margin and 7.8 cm. from the distal margin.  The circumference of the proximal bowel is 10 cm, the distal bowel 5.5 cm, and the circumference is \nnarrowed to 3.7 cm. in the area of the tumor. The cut surface of the tumor is tan-white, and t he central \nulcerated area is coated with purulent material.  There is a polypoid projection of the mucosa at the \ndistal edge of the tumor measuring 0.4x0.6 cm., raised above the mucosal surface 0.7 cm.  In the region of serosal puckering, the tumor is 1.2 cm. deep, and appears to extend through the muscularis \nand into the subserosal fat.  Adjacent to this area there are three tan-white nodules in the subserosal \nfat, 1.1 cm., 1 cm. and 0.7 cm. in maximum dimension.  Two additional nodules are identified in t he \n  \nsubserosal fat 1.1 cm. in maximum dimension.

The serosal surface is tan-pink, smooth and grossly unremarkable.  The attached appendix is  7 cm in length and 0.4 cm in \ndiameter and shows unremarkable external and cut surfaces.  The specimen is opened and shows a 4.2 x 3 x 0.6 cm tumor mass with central ulceration located at the mid portion of the right colon at 8 cm from the closest (distal margin) and 12.5 cm from the ileo-cecal valve.  This lesion involves the portion of the colon which is not covered with serosa. It  invades through the muscularis into the subserosa.  A \nsecond polypoid lesion is identified in the area corresponding to the base of the appendix.  This lesion \nmeasures 2.5 x 2.3 x 0.7 cm.  Sectioning shows the lesion to be confined to the mucosa without definite \nevidence of invasion.  The remainder of the colon shows an unremarkable tan pink mucosa.

A perpendicular section\nthrough the mass reveals continuity with the circumferential colonic mass extending through a thick muscular wall, having up to 1.9 cm in thickness.\nThis wall likely represents urinary bladder wall. The bulk mass of tumor\npresent outside the colon measures 9.5 x 7.0 x 6.0 cm. The mass is grossly\nextending through the entire colonic wall thickness minimally penetrating\ngrossly into the pericolonic adipose tissue, at 0.5 cm from the serosal\nlining.

The tumor is surrounded by adenomatous colonic mucosa\nwith tubulovillous architecture. The tumor seems to invade the sigmoid\ncolon wall and penetrates into the muscular bladder wall extending close to\nthe bladder mucosal urothelium, but without directly involving it. The\nbladder mucosa shows extensive hemorrhagic cystitis with subepithelial\nhemorrhage and congestion and extensive inflammatory infiltrate and edema\nwithin the mucosal lamina propria. There is extensive acute serositis\ninvolving the peritoneum with submesothelial polymorphonuclear cells. This\nacute inflammatory process involves the resection margins, as well.

The 0.8 cm peritoneal nodule is a spindle cell tumor, and the\ndifferential diagnosis includes a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) and\na leiomyoma. Immunohistochemical stains will be performed in order to\nbetter characterize this lesion, and results will be issued in an addendum\nreport. The majority of the primary colon tumor has the pattern of a\nconventional adenocarcinoma, with less than 50% having mucinous or signet\nring cell features.\nStaff Pathologist\nPertinent Clinical Information\nSmall white peritoneal nodule adjacent to the right colon.\nGross Description\nSpecimen Material: Right colon.\nThe case is received in one part labeled with the patient's name, , medical record number and\ngiven accession number and it\nis accompanied by a requisition form labeled with the same name and same\naccession number.\nThe specimen is received fresh in one container as \"RIGHT COLON\" and\nconsists of 26 cm length of cecum with a diameter of 5.4 cm, 11.3 cm length\nof terminal ileum, a 2.5 cm diameter, and a 6.3 cm in length appendix with\na diameter of 1.2 cm. There is a 9.5 x 5.9 x 3.1 cm portion of mesenteric\nfat and a 16.0 x 5.9 x 0.6 cm portion of attached pericolonic fat. The\ncolonic serosa is tan-pink to tan-red, hemorrhagic. There is a cecal\numbilication located 16.5 cm from the proximal margin and 18 cm from the\ndistal margin. The mesentery displays a palpable 4.2 x 3.4 x 1.7 cm mass, which extends to the surgical mesenteric margin. The mesenteric margin is\ninked blue. The serosal umbilication is inked black. There is a 0.8 cm in\ngreatest dimension grey-white hard, ovoid nodule attached to gray-white to\ntan-pink fibromembranous tissue attached to the cecal serosal surface. The\ncecal mucosa displays a tan-red to tan-green, 7.2 x 6.9 cm, endophytic,\nhard, ulcerative, circumferential tumor which obliterates the ileocecal\nvalve. The adjacent appendiceal orifice is located 11.2 cm from the\nproximal margin and is 9.9 cm from the distal margin. The cut surface of\nthe tumor measures 4.5 cm thick, involves the attached fat and abuts the\ninked serosa. Multiple lymph nodes are identified ranging from 1.8 to 0.3\ncm Their cut surfaces and grey-white and hard. The cut surface of the\nmesenteric mass display that it abuts the mesenteric margin and is\ngray-white and hard. The appendix is unremarkable.

The specimen is received in a single container labeled with the patient's\nname, medical record number ,and additionally identified as, 'ileum, right colon, transverse colon, omentum and lymph node'. Received fresh and placed in\nformalin is a hemicolectomy specimen composed of a 44 cm long and 3.2 cm\ncircumference segment of ileum attached to a 30 cm long and 8.3 cm circumference\nsegment of large bowel. There is a palpable mass in the cecum; the serosal\nsurface overlying this palpable mass is adherent to the serosal surface of the\ntransverse colon, forming a loop of large bowel.\nThe bowel is opened to reveal a partially fungating cecal mass, measuring 7.5 x\n4.5 cm, which tunnels inward to a maximal extent of 5.3 cm, extending 3 cm into\nthe ileum. The mucosal surface of the adherent transverse colon is retracted\ntoward the mass but appears intact. The mass is located 25 cm from the proximal\nresection margin, 3 cm from the distal resection margin, and 1.0 cm from the\napparent mesenteric margin. The serosa overlying the mass is inked black; the\nmesenteric margin is inked red. On sectioning, the mass abuts the black inked\nmargin and does not invade into the wall of the adherent transverse colon.\nThe remaining mucosa demonstrates two nearby cecal polyps, measuring 0.7 and 1.7\ncm in greatest dimension. The pericolonic adipose tissue is dissected for lymph\nnode candidates. Multiple lymph nodecandidates are identified. Appendix is not\nidentified. Additionally submitted with this specimen is a separate segment of\nunoriented small bowel measuring 19 cm in length by 3.3 cm in internal\ncircumference; it is grossly unremarkable.\nBlock summary:\nA l : Proximal resection margin\nA2: Distal resection margin\nA3-A4 :Mass closest approach to mesenteric margin\nA5: Mass relationship to transverse colon\nA6-A 10 Multiple blocks of mass\nA11: Smaller polyp\nA12: Larger polyp\nA 13: 4 lymph node candidates\nA14: 4 lymph nodes\nA15: 2 lymph nodes\nA 16-A 19 :One lymph node in each cassette\nPathologist Sign Out:\nCritarla/14) /1 a3Diagnosis Discrepancy\nPrimary rumor Site Discrepancy\nHIPAA Discrepancy\nPrior Malignancy History1 yes Noi",

The specimen is received fresh intraoperatively for consultation from , labeled with\nthe patient's name and designated on the requisition as \"right colon, frozen for margins, rest\nroutine,\" and consists of a segment of right colon measuring 6.5 cm in length and averaging 5\ncm in diameter with an attached portion of ileum, measuring 8.5 cm in length and averaging 3\ncm in diameter. The appendix is present and measures 7.2 x 1.2 x 1.0 cm and appears slightly\ndilated in its midportion. The specimen is opened to reveal a large polypoid fungating mass,\nmeasuring 11.2 x 6.8 x 1.9 cm, which involves the cecum and a small portion of the terminal\nileum. The mass is 8 cm from the proximal margin at its closest point and 6.5 cm from the distal\nmargin at its closest point. A shave of the distal margin is frozen. The frozen section diagnosis\nby is \"DISTAL MARGIN ,NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA.\" The intraoperative\nconsultation diagnosis is communicated to the operating room at .After\nfrozen section, the area under the tumor is inked black and the tumor is serially sectioned to\nreveal that it appears to extend through the colonic wall and into the pericolonic fat, but not to\nthe inked margin. Additionally, there is a large mass, consistent with matted lymph nodes, in\nthe pericolonic fat, which measures 6.5 x 4.5 x 3.5 cm. The specimen is representatively\nsubmitted as follows:\n1-2 - shave of distal margin (frozen residues)\n3 - shave of proximal margin\n4 - base of appendix and tip, bisected\n5 - representative sections from midsection of appendix (appears\ndilated)\n6-8 - tumor with apparent extension into pericolonic fat\n9-10 - tumor with relationship to inked margin\nPage 2 of 3 Surgery Date:\n11 - representative section from grossly positive lymph node\n12 - one lymph node, bisected\n13 - representative sections from another grossly positive lymph node\n14 - representative sections from a third grossly positive lymph node\n15 - grossly positive lymph node vs soft tissue tumor deposit\n16 - two possible lymph nodes\n17 - one lymph node, bisected\n18 - three possible lymph nodes\n19 - three possible lymph nodes\n20 - two possible lymph nodes\n21 - two possible lymph nodes\nFrozen Section Diagnosis\nA. \"DISTAL MARGIN ,NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA.\"\nCriteria ^_\nDiagnosis fliscnvarcy\nPrimary-f^nor bite DisaeFx^c^\nHIPAA Dscrc?an-Y\nPrior Ma i J af`V History\nDual/Syn+h^inn^s Fri.\nCase i. +circlcl:\nReviewer .^.itiBlse_ca _\n/.:DIS JAU ,^ CD\n31P I:evicv\nPage 3 of 3",

The specimen is opened along the antimesenteric site to reveal a\nlarge friable fungating mass measuring 7.0 x 7.0 x 5.0 cm, filling the cecum. The mass is 5.5 cm from the distal rection margin\nand 4.5 cm from the proximal resection margin. The mass appears to be circumferential and due to the size of the mass, distorts\nthe specimen. There is an attached appendix, 10.0 cm in length with an average diameter of 0.7 cm. The appendix is serially\nsectioned revealing a 0.2 cm lumen filled with brown soft fecal material. The appendix does not appear to be involved by the\nmass. The appendiceal orifice is inked green. The distal margin is marked by a suture and is inked blue. The pericolonic fat\ndeep to the mass is inked black. The mass is sectioned to reveal an average thickness of 0.9 cm. The mass appears to extend\nthrough the submucosal and into the wall. The mass focally replaces the wall and extends into the pericolonic fat. The remainder\nof the mucosa is tan-pink with mucosal folds arranged in the usual manner, however, there is a 0.7 x 0.7 x 0.3 cm tan-pink polyp that\nis 1.0 cm from the blue inked distal resection margin. Sectioning of the pericolonic fat reveals 13 possible lymph nodes ranging in\nsize from 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm to 1.3 x 1.2 x 1.0 cm. The remainder of the pericolonic fat is unremarkable.\nMR #: Page 2 of 3\nDate of Printing : SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT\nNAME: SURG PATH #:\nMR #: ALT ID #:\nA portion of the mass is submitted in cassettes Al FS for frozen and permanent section.
