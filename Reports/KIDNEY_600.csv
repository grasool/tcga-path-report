GROSS DESCRIPTION:
e nay & ureter: Received fresh labeled eft kidney and ureter"" and consists of a 1151 gram
nephrectomy specimen measuring 25 x.15 x 9 an lndud ng dney measuring 22 x 12 x 6 cm and perirenal fat
ranging in thickness from 1 to 6 cm. Extending from the renal pelvis is a ureter (8 x 0.5 cm) renal artery measuring 7x
0.5 cm, and rend vein measuring 0.5 x 1 cm. The renal vein is free of gross abnormality at the margin. The specimen
is received with a surface disruption at the inferior pole and at the lateral aspect of the kidney measuring 6 cm in
greatest dimension through which friable necrotic debris extrudes. The adjacent fat is marked with black ink. In the
mid lower pole and corresponding to the capsular disruption is a well circumscribed predominantly necrotic mass
measuring 15 x 10 x 9 cm. The mass lies 1 cm from the renal vein margin and grossly extends through the renal Page 2 of 2
capsule and perirenal fat at the capsular disruption site. The remainder of the renal cortex is tan-brown with a well
defined corticomedullaryjunction. The pelvis and calyces are covered by smooth glistenin mucosa .The adipose
tissue is thinly sectioned, and no lymph nodes are found .The case is reviewed by , Representative sections
of the specimen are submitted as follows :Al) renal vein, artery and ureter margins en face ;A2-3) capsular
disruption two fragments per cassette ;A4-8) capsule wall, two fragments per cassette ;A9) non- neoplastic kidney;
Al 0) perinephritic fat.
At the request oM the specimen is regrossed with additional sections of the perlhilar blood vessels
submitted in cassettes Al 1-A15 under the direction ot^ ^s
MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
Sections of vascular and ureteral margin tissues do not show a neoplasm .Sections of the grossly described
lesion show a necrotic papillary carcinoma with patchy hemosiderin, and areas of variably foamy cytoplasm. Nuclear
characteristics show areas of prominent nucleoli and irregular nuclear borders. There is associated organizing blood.
Small vessel vascular space invasion is present .Tumor does not a ear to involve renal pelvis or hilar tissues.
Sarcomatoid areas are not seen In the examined sections.

Preop erative Diagnosis
Left renal mass
Gross Description
A. The specimen is received fresh, labeled left kidney"" and consists of a kidney with partial
encapsulated perinephric tissue, 844.0 g, 19.5 x 9.8 x 8.6 cm. The specimen is inked black. The
adrenal gland is not identified.
The cut surfaces exhibit an irregular tumor mass involving the cortex and medulla in the superior,
middle and inferior poles, 8..7 x 7.6 x 7.2 cm- The tumor is variegated, pale tan-pink and soft with
smooth lobulated sections.. Marked fibrotic septation is noted. Neither necrosis, hemorrhage or cystic
degeneration is identified. The tumor invades 90% of the calyceal system and extends to the hilum.
The renal vein, artery and ureter are probe patent, and not Involved by tumor. The tumor does not
appear to invade the renal sinus, nor penetrate through the renal capsule to involve the permephric fat..
The tumor is sharply demarcated from normal parenchyma .Satellite tumor nodules are not present-
The remaining renal parenchyma is pink -tan, smooth and glistening with a well -demarcated
rtico-medullary junction, 1.5 cm thickness- The papillae are blunted. A. segment of attached ureter
is noted (4.5 cm length x 4 mm diameter). The renal artery reveals no significant atherosclerotic
changes- No lymph nodes are identified. Representative sections are submitted in A1-A14 as
labeled:
Al: Mirror image section of tumor for Tissue Procurement Laboratory
Renal vein and artery with ureter resection margin,: tangential

Gross Description
A. Specimen A is received fresh, labeled 'right kidney' and consists of a kidney with moderate
pennephric soft tissue ,462.3 g ,16.5 x 9- 5x 6-7 cm overall dimension -The adr enal.gland is non -intact
and ragged, 3 x 1.5 x 1 cm_ The kidney (12.5 x 6.5 x. 4.5 cm) is firm and inked black. The inferior pole
exhibits an exophytic encapsulated nodule of the lateral aspect ,3..1.x 2 .6x 2.5 cm .Sectioned, the
nodule is pale tan, solid and smooth, with scant necrosis (5%) and focal hemorrhage. The nodule
grossly originates from the parenchyma, and does not penetrate the renal capsule or perinephric tat.
The nodule does not involve the renal pelvis, calices or pelvic fat. The renal artery ,vein and ureter are
not affected by the nodule .Located in the superior and middle pole are several intraparenchymal
cysts, containing clear serous fluid, I to 2.5 cm diameter- The cyst lining is smooth with no papillary
excrescences noted .The papillae are blunted and the cortex is 8 mm thick .An external segment of
ureter is noted (5.4 cm length x 3 mm diameter) and is probe patent .The renal vein is firm with
moderate atherosclerotic changes and appears 40-50% occluded- A 5 mm orange-yellow ovoid
calculus is identified in the renal pelvis. No constrict or dilation of the calices is identified.
Representative sections including all margins are submitted in Al-A10 as labeled:
Al: Resection margin of renal artery, vein and ureter, tangential.

Comment :While the margins of the main specimen are uninvolved ,tumor is seen at the inked surgical margins
surrounding the larger of the pericaval lymph nodes (specimen #2). The tumor is composed of papillary structures with
fibrovascular cores ,which are lined by tumor cells with amphophilic cytoplasm and large ,slightly irregular nuclei with
prominent eosinophilic nucleoli.

SPECIMEN (S) SUBMITTED :GROSS DESCRIPTION
1. Right kidney mass: In formalin labeled ""right kidney mass"" is a 15 x 7.5 x 6.5 cm kidney with abundant attached
perinephric fat weight 1,721 grams in aggregate. There is 3.5 cm ureter extending from the renal hilum. The kidney is
bivalved to reveal an ill defined 8.5 cm in greatest dimension variegated tan-white to red nodular tumor within the
superior pole. On cut section, the tumor grossly appears to possibly extend into the perinephric fat at the superior pole.
The lining of the renal pelvis is grey-white and slightly bosselated. Upon sectioning it appears that the tumor elevates
the urothelium and It is unclear at gross dissection whether the tumor penetrates through the urothelium into the renal
pelvis. The tumor also grossly extends into the renal artery, lying 5mm from the renal artery resection margin. The
remaining renal parenchyma is pale tan-pink with an ill defined corticomedullary junction. There is a small portion of
adrenal gland at the most superior aspect of the specimen with an orange red out surface. The gland grossly does not
appear to be involved by tumor. The perinephric fat is inked black. Representative sections are submitted in eight
cassettes as labeled: A vascular and ureter margins, B tumor to include perinephric fat, C-D tumor to include renal
pelvis, E tumor to include renal artery, F tumor to include uninvolved renal parenchyma, G normal renal parenchyma, H
adrenal gland.
2. Peri-caval node. In formalin labeled ""peri-caval node"" are two nodular tan-pink tissues which measure 3.5 x 3 x 2.3 cm
3.and 2.5 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm. The larger tissue Is inked blue and the smaller tissue is inked black. Sectioning of the larger
tissue reveals a slightly friable and partially cystic tan-pink cut surface containing coagulated blood. Sectioning of the
smaller tissue reveals a partially cystic red-brown cut surface containing coagulated blood. Representative sections are
submited in 4 cassettes as follows: A-B entire smaller tissue ,C-D larger tissue.
Gallbladder :In formalin labeled ""gallbladder"" is a 9.5 x 5 x 2.8 cm intact gallbladder. The serosa is tan-pink and dull.
The cystic duct is 0.3 cm in diameter and patent .The gallbladder wall averages 0.2 cm in thickness. The mucosa is
velvety yellow-red with diffuse yellow stippling within the body. The lumen contains tan-yellow viscous bile and a 2.5 cm
green -black granu,tar cholelith. Representative sections to .include the cystic duct margin (inked black) are submitted in
one cassette.

Justification: The report specifically mentions a right kidney mass, which was surgically removed.

Laterality: Right
Justification: The kidney and subsequent descriptions in the report clearly refer to the right kidney.

Histology: Papillary renal cell carcinoma
Justification: The pathologist's report describes the tumor as being composed of papillary structures with fibrovascular cores, which are lined by tumor cells with amphophilic cytoplasm and large, slightly irregular nuclei with prominent eosinophilic nucleoli. These features are consistent with a papillary renal cell carcinoma.

Stage: pT3a pN1
Justification: The pathologic tumor stage is provided in the report as pT3a pN1, which indicates that the tumor has invaded the perinephric fat and the renal vein, with positive lymph nodes present.

measuring 23 x 12.5 x 10 em and weighing 1,394 grams. The 
surface shows prominent vasculature and is partially covered on

x 7 em. The ureter measures 9 x 0.5 x 0.4 eni. The anterior side 
of the kidney is coated with black ink and the posterior side 
with green ink. 
On bivalving the specimen, almost the entire kidney is displa.ced 
wjth tan-yellow hemorrhagic tumor with the ex~eption of portions 
of kidney at the inferior and medial aspects. The kidney itself 
measures 13 x 8 x 8 em. Tumor is identified outside the capsule

Right renal mass. 
Gross Description 
Received in formalin and labeled ""right kidney"" is a kidney surfaced by a moderate amount of perirenal fat 
which together total 399 gm. Trimmed of fat the kidney is 133 gm, 9.3 x 5.8 x 3.8 cm. Arising from the 
renal pelvis is a 7.8 cm in length and 0.6 em in diameter segment of ureter, a 2.2 cm in length and 1 em in 
diameter segment of renal artery, and a 1.2 cm in length and 0.8 cm in diameter segment of renal vein. No 
lymph nodes are identified in the renal pelvis and no adrenal gland tissue is identified within the perirenal 
fat. The kidney is purple-brown with a faint lobulated appearance. On the inferior pole there is a 3.5 em in 
diameter spherical nodule with a yellow-tan coloration. In this area the capsule is inked black. The cut 
surface identifies a 5.5 x 3.5 x 3.5 cm mottled yellow-tan tumor mass with focal areas of hemorrhagic 
necrosis and white fibrous areas up to 1.2 cm in maximum diameter. In addition, there are cystic structures 
from 0.1 to 1 cm in diameter. Grossly, the tumor mass extends to the renal capsule but does not penetrate 
the capsule. In addition, the tumor extends into the vein ofthe renal pelvis. The remaining renal 
parenchyma is red-brown. The surface of the cortex exhibits broad-based scars up to 1.6 cm in diameter. 
In addition, there are renal retention cysts from 0.2 to 0.8 cm. The renal cortex averages 0.5 cm in 
thickness and the medulla averages 1.2 cm. No other masses or indurated areas are grossly identified. 
Summary of sections: 1 -surgical margins of the ureter, renal artery and renal vein, 2-4 -tumor mass and 
renal capsule, 5-6 -tumor mass and renal pelvis, 7 -representative section of renal parenchyma with scar, 
8 -representative section of renal parenchyma with renal retention cysts, 9-11 tumor within segmental

The ureteral margin and vascular margins are submitted in 
block two. The ureteropelvic junction is submitted in block 
two. The lesion pushes against the capsular membrane but 
does not appear to involve it. The mass and capsule are 
sampled in block's four through six. The capsule strips 
easily from the surface of the kidney. No additional areas 
of lesion are grossly identified. The cortex averages 1.5 
cm thickness. The calices are not dilated. Representative 
sections of normal appearing kidney are submitted in block's

 Received in formalin is a kidney with attached perirenal adipose 
tissue and adrenal glands. The specimen weighs 1,204 grams and measures 24.0 
x 15.0 x 7.0 em in overall dimensions. The kidney measures 11,0 cm from 
. superior to inferior, 8.5 cm from medial to lateral, and 4.5 em from anterior 
to posterior. The kidney weighs 350 grams. Located at the hilum is a 1.3 cm 
in length x 0.4 cm in diameter portion of artery which is adjacent to a 
portion of renal vein which is bifurcated and measures 2.0 cm in length x 0.3 
cm in diameter. The ureter measures 10.0 em in length x 0.2 em in diameter. 
The external surface consists of a large amount of bosselated tan-yellow 
perirenal adipose tissue. On sectioning, a fairly well circumscribed mass is 
identified within the lower pole which measures 5.5 x 4.0 x 4.0 cm in overall 
dimension. The cut surface consists of soft, diffusely congested, red golden 
yellow tissue with scattered irregular, gray-tan, cystic areas. The solid 
tissue comprises approximately 60% of the cut surface and the cystic portion 
40%. The lesion lies subjacent to the renal pelvis and shows possible focal 
extension into the adjacent hilar fat. This focal extension is located 
adjacent to a portion of the renal artery. The mass involves 50% of the lower 
pole and also shows irregular satellite lesions composed of soft golden 
yellow-red tissue which range in size from 0.2 to 0.8 cm in greatest 
dimension. The mass is located 4.0 em from the renal artery/renal vein 
margin. The mass measures 1.0 cm from the radial soft tissue margin. The 
capsule surrounding the mass strips with ease. The remainder of the renal 
parenchyma is pink-brown with a distinct corticomedullary junction. The 
cortex measures 0.5 cm in thickness and the medulla measures 1.2 cm in 
thickness. The cortical surface is pink-tan, smooth and glistening. The

Received in a single container labeled right 
kidney is a previously bivalve right nephrectomy specimen surrounded 
by a large amount of perinephric adipose tissue and faced anteriorly 
by a moderate amount of Gerotas fascia. The specimen as received 
weighs 1320 grams and on reconstruction measures 25.6 x 14.0 x 8.5 
em. In the anterior superior medial aspect is a 5.1 x 2.4 x 1.0 em 
recognizable adrenal gland which on sectioning has a bright yellow 
cortex surrounding a hyalinized tan gray medulla. The cortex has an 
eccentric 0.7 em bright yellow chalky appearing nodule through the 
cortex in the central portion of the specimen. The margins of 
resection include 0.7 cm of grossly patent renal artery, 0.8 cm of 
grossly patent renal vein and 9.8 cm of grossly patent ureter. The 
capsule strips with slight difficulty to reveal to an organ measuring 
12.8 x 7.0 x 6.0 cm. The cortex is lobulated, slightly pale tan 
brown. The cortex measures up to 1.0 cm and is slightly granular and 
tan brown. The corticomedullary junction is poorly defined. The 
medulla is gray brown and slightly hyalinized with focal blunting of 
the papillae. The calices and pelvis at the upper pole are grossly 
distorted by the presence of a 7.8 x 6.5 x 6.2 cm lobulated tan gray

grossly patent renal vein, and 9.8 ern of grossly patent ureter. The 
capsule strips with ease to reveal an organ measuring 11.4 x 7.2 x 
5.6 em. This has a lobulated finely granular red brown cortical 
surface. The specimen is previously sectioned in the low posterior 
pole to reveal an eccentric 2.7 x 2.5 x 2.2 em well circumscribed 
thinly encapsulated chalky gray yellow to brown focally hemorrhagic 
lesion. On sectioning this lesion has a tan pink to yellow focally 
hemorrhagic cut surface but appears grossly confined to the capsule. 
This grossly appears to focally extend to within 0.1 em of the 
cortical margin; however, the lesion does not appear to extend beyond 
the capsule into the cortex. The surrounding parenchyma is slightly 
focally compresseq by this lesion; however, the lesion does not

Received in a single container labeled I -left kidney"" is 
a previously bisected 1040 gram left nephrectomy specimen surrounded 
by a large amount of perinephric adipose tissue and faced anteriorly 
by a moderate amount of Gerota's fascia. The specimen on 
reconstruction measures 24.0 x 13.8 x 9.8 em. The margins of 
resection include 1.5 em of grossly patent renal artery, 1.3 ern of 
grossly patent renal vein and 7.0 em of grossly patent ureter. The 
capsule strips \1i th ease to reveal an organ measuring 12.4 x 8.5 x 
6.9 cm on reconstruction. There is a lobulated slightly pale 
red-brown slightly granular cortex. The cortex measures up to 1.0 em 
and is slightly granular red-brown. The corticomedullary junction is 
poorly defined. The medulla is red-brOl<n ""Iith sharp papillae. The 
calyces and pelvis are lined by smooth gray-white mucosa extending 
into the ureter. Noted on the posterior aspect extending into the 
hilus is a well-defined 5.2 x 4.8 x 4.5 cm thinly encapsulated 
gray-tan to yellow nodule with a friable focally chalky, focally 
hemorrhagic gray-yellow to brown cut surface. The capsule appears 
grossly in~act. This lesion grossly extends beyond the plane of the 
kidney into the surrounding adipose tissue; hOi-leVer I the capsule does 
not appear to be grossly transected. The lower pole calyx immediately 
adjacent to the lesion is dilated with a 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm granular 
brOl-m-black calculus within the calyx. The lesion further appears to 
compress hilar adipose tissue and structures but does not grossly 
appear to extend into them. On further sectioning this parenchyma 
reveals a second slightly dilated lower pole calyx which has a 0.4 x 
0.3 x 0.2 cm similar gray-brown to black calculus. Within the 
parenchyma adjacent to these dilated calyces there is a 0.4 x 0.4 x

HISTORY
Renal mass
(StageIV chronic kidney diseasewith history of renal transplant)
GROSS
Received fresh in a container labeled left kidney"" is a kidney with
a moderate amount of attached perinephric fat (12.5 x 8 x 4.8 cm).
The kidney by itself (9.5 x 3.8 x 3.2 cm), weighs 78 grams. Hilar
vessels are up to 0.8 cm long, 2.5 cm in diameter. The renal vein
lumen is widely patent. The attached ureter (2.5 cm long, 0.4 cm in
diameter) has a metal clip across the lumen adjacent to the margin.
The inferior pole of the kidney has a 4 cm in diameter discrete
tumor nodule with a mottled, spongy orange gray cut surface.
Scattered areasof hemorrhage are present throughout. The tumor has
a discrete pushing margin, which produces a bulge in the overlying
intact capsule. Extension into the adjacent perinephric fat is not
apparent. The overlying adventitia margin is marked with black ink.
Superiorly, the tumor margin is within 0.2 cm of the renal sinus
fat.Direct extension into perinephric fat is not apparent. The
remaining renal parenchyma has athin, atrophic firm tan cortex (up
to 0.5 cm thick) and numerous cortical cysts containing clear fluid
and old, brown'blood. Renal pyramids are atrophic. Major and minor
calices along with the renal pelvis are lined by mildly striated
gray-white mucosa.

perinephric fat there is a intact appearing 6.5 x 3.5 x 1 cm portion of adrenal gland. Along the anterior
surface of the kidney there Is a thin delicate membranous tissue consistent with Gerota 's fascia
approximately measuring 10 x 5 cm. The central-lateral surface of the nephrectomy specimen is torn and
disrupted exposing the cortical surface of the kidney which Is bulging .Serial sections of the adrenal gland
reveal no gross evidence of tumor involvement. At the hilum of the kidney the renal artery and renal vein
are identified. The vessels are opened and there is no gross evidence of intraluminal tumor. Extending
from the hilum of the kidney is a small caliber portion of ureter which is 6.5 cm in length and 0.3 cm In
diameter. The ureter is opened to the renal pelvis to reveal the urothelium Is tan-white and smooth and
unremarkable. Sectioning through the central-lateral surface of the kidney reveals a well circumscribed
golden yellow and thinly capsulated appearing neoplasm which overall measures 3.3 x 3.2 x 2.8 cm. This
neoplasm abuts the cortical surface of the kidney but grossly does not appear to extend through the renal
capsule Into the small amount of adherent perirenal adipose tissue .The neoplasm Is 3.5 cm from the
hilum and hilar vascuiature. There is some cautery and cavitation of the renal parenchyma just along the
superior edge of the tumor suggestive of surgical manipulation .There is some hemorrhage extending
into the hilar fat. The kidney away from the neoplasm has a normal reddish brown appearance and the
cortical medullary junction appears distinct. The cortical thickness is 0.7 cm. Close sectioning of the
remainder of the kidney reveals no additional masses. The perinephric adipose tissue is dissected but no
lymph nodes are identified grossly. Also in the specimen container is an additional 7.5 cm aggregate of
lobulated fatty tissue which is serially sectioned and palpably unremarkable. Representative sections of
the tumor are obtained for research purposes. Following fixation the sections are submitted as
summarized below: Section summary: Al) surgical margin, renal artery, renal vein and ureter, A2)
adrenal gland, A3) additional sections of ureter and ureteral pelvic junction, A4) Gerota's fascia, A5-A7)
sections of central-lateral tumor and cortical surface of kidney, A7-A8) sections of tumor and immediately
adjacent renal tissue. Additional section of tumor adjacent to the renal sinus was submitted in Al 0, and
an additional section of renal artery and renal vein are submitted in cassette Al 1.^

Histologic sections from the left kidney show a unifocal tumor mass measuring 3.0 em in greatest dimension . Grossly the tumor appears to be limited to 
the kidney. However, there is an area in which there is microscopic transgression of the renal capsule with tumor extending approximately 0.1 cm into the 
perinephric adipose tissue. The tumor is not identified at the margins of resection. The tumor shows a papillary pattern consisting of polygonal to 
columnar shaped cells with enlarged oval nuclei and prominent nucleoli. Numerous clusters of macrophages are present within the papillary stalks. The 
histoloaic aopearance is that of papillary renal cell carcinoma.  .~ """" .

Gross Description: 
The specimen is labeled left kidney and ureter and is received without fixative. It consists of a 
nephrectomy specimen with adherent long segment of ureter which weighs   The nephrectomy 
specimen measures 14 cm from superior to inferior, 7.5 cm from medial to lateral, and 5 cm from anterior 
to posterior. There is no grossly identifiable adrenal gland tissue. Along the anterior surface of the kidney 
is a 8 x 5.5 cm area of thin delicate adherent tissue suggestive of Gerota's fascia. At the hilum the renal 
artery and renal vein are identified. The vessels are opened and show no gross evidence of intraluminal 
tumor. Extending from the hilum of the kidney is a 26 cm segment of ureter which proximally and 
centrally has a diameter of 0.5 cm, up to 0.6 cm at the distal end. A yellow plastic stent is present in the 
lumen of the ureter. The ureter is opened and the urothelium is tan and smooth. At the pelvis friable 
tumor is present in the renal pelvis arising from the central calix. The kidney is bivalved to reveal a finely 
granular tan-white neoplasm occupying the superior pole calix and extending into the middle pole calix. 
This neoplasm overall measures 3.7 x 3.2 x 3.2 cm. It is approximately 1 cm from Gerota's fascia and 1.5 
cm from the renal hilar vascular margin. It involves the upper pole and central pole calices. The inferior 
pole calix appears uninvolved. The renal parenchyma is otherwise reddish brown and cortical thickness is 
0.6 cm. There are no obvious lymph nodes in the perinephric adipose tissue. Representative sections are

Gross Description: 
A. The specimen is labeled left kidney mass and is received without fixative. It consists of a cortical 
portion of kidney which overall measures 3.3 x 3.1 x 2.9 cm and  The cortical surface of 
the kidney appears smooth with intact renal capsule. The surgical margin is inked. The specimen is 
serially sectioned to reveal a well circumscribed mass measuring 2.5 x 2.5 x 1.8 cm. This mass is variably 
composed of pale tan to granular reddish and hemorrhagic tissue. It abuts the cortical surface but there is 
no overlying perirenal fat. It is grossly 0.5 cm from the closest cortical resection margin. Representative 
sections of this neoplasm are obtained for research purposes. Also in the specimen container is a 4 cm 
aggregate of lobulated fatty tissue which is serially sectioned and contains no obvious tumor. 
Representative sections are submitted. Section summary: A1-A4) renal neoplasm and cortical resection 
margin, A5) peripheral section of neoplasm and representative separate fatty tissue.
8. The specimen is labeled prostate and is received in formalin. It consists of a prostatectomy specimen 
which  The prostate gland measures 3.7 x 3.5 x 3.4 cm and includes a partially 
disrupted 2.5 x 1.5 x 0.7 cm right seminal vesicle, a 1.7 cm segment of right vas deferens, a 1.7 cm 
segment of left vas deferens, and a short but intact appearing 1.8 x 1.3 x 0.9 cm left seminal vesicle. The 
right anterior surface of the prostate is inked blue, the left anterior surface is inked green, and the posterior 
surface is inked black. The prostatic apex, bladder neck, and seminal vesicle / vasa are trimmed. The 
prostate is divided into right and left halves and is sectioned from apex to bladder neck. The right apical 
portion of the prostate anteriorly displays pale yellow-tan discoloration in two discrete foci, each 0.7 cm in 
maximum dimensions. One of these areas is just adjacent to the apical portion of the prostate and the 
other is located in the mid gland. The prostatic gland parenchyma throughout the left prostate is spongy 
tan and fibrous. Representative sections are submitted. Section summary: 81) right prostatic apex, 82) left 
prostatic apex, 83) right bladder neck, 84) left bladder neck, 85) surgical margin right vas deferens, right 
seminal vesicle, 86) surgical margin left vas deferens, left seminal vesicle, 87-824) prostate, apex­

Microscopic Description 
Sections include kidney with a sharply circumscribed, partially encapsulated 
epithelial neoplasm. The neoplasm is characterized by a predominantly solid or 
tubular growth pattern with foci of micropapillary or papilliform architecture. 
The predominant tumor cell is a small cuboidal cell with uniform, round, small 
bland nucleus and modest amounts of predominantly clear cytoplasm. There is a 
second cell population present in the lumina of the tubules. The luminal 
population consists of larger polygonal cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and a 
single, slightly enlarged oval to reniform nucleus with granular chromatin and a 
small nucleolus. The latter cells form intral~minal poorly cohesive sheets. 
There are scattered foci of foamy macrophages within the interstitium of the 
tumor. Focally the tumor extends through its thin fibrous capsule and 
infiltrates into native renal parenchyma in a broad front. Focally tumor abuts 
on an inked parenchymal resection margin (black ink, A2). In the histologic 
sections convincing extrarenal extension into perinephric soft tissue is not 
identified. 
A PAS stain is applied to sections of uninvolved nonneoplastic kidney (A7). It 
demonstrates very focal mild interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy with rare 
colocalized ischemic sclerotic glomeruli. The glomeruli are unremarkable. 
Neither crescents nor mesangial proliferation nor primary glomerulopathy is 
seen.

tissue measuring 2.8 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm. The cut surface is tan-brown. Representative sections are submitted._ 
Specimen B, received in formalin labeled perihilar renal lymph node, consists ofa 1.7 x 1.3 x 0.8 cm p._rtion fa lymph 
node. The cut surface is homogenous tan-pink. The node is sectioned and entirely submitted labeled 
Specimen C, received fresh from the OR labeled left kidney, consists of the following: 
Procedure/specimen type: Radical nephrectomy. 
Specimen laterality: Left. 
Pe$cription of specimen: The 726 gm kidney with associated perinephric fat measures overall 19.0 x 14.0 x 7.0 
cm. Gerota's fascia is hemorrhagic with fibrous adhesions. Gerota's fascia is fibrotic and 
thickened measuring up to 0.5 cm. The perinephric fat is firm and lobulated measuring up 
to 2.0 cm in thickness. Blue ink is applied to Gerota's fascia and the mass grossly 
appears to abut the fascia. The attached segment of ureter measures 4.0 cm in length 
with an internal diameter of 0.3 cm and is grossly unremarkable and not involved by the 
tumor. 
The kidney measures 12.0 x 6.5 x 5.5 cm. The kidney is surrounded by a large cystic 
hemorrhagic mass containing blood clot. The mass is attached to the kidney and grossly 
involves the renal parenchyma superiorly. Sections show a soft tan expansile solid area 
within the cystic mass abutting the surface of the kidney and slightly compressing the 
renal parenchyma. 
The renal pelvis is slightly displaced. The corticomedullary junction within the superior 
pole of the kidney is pale white-pink and compressed. Within the superior pole of the 
kidney is a portion of attached adrenal gl,md measuring 3.0 x 3.0 x 0.3 cm. The adrenal 
parenchyma shows thin brown medulla with focally thickened golden yellow cortex. The 
portion of adrenal gland is markedly adherent to the surface of the kidney and gross 
involvement by tumor cannot be definitively determined. 
I   HISTOLOGY REPORT 
Adrenal gland: Also received within the specimen container is a separate portion of adrenal gland 
measuring 5.0 x 2.2 x 1.5 cm and weighing 8 gm. The cut surface shows thin golden 
yellow cortices with brown medulla. The adrenal gland grossly does not appear to be

COMMENT: Immunohistochemical staining is positive for OSCAR-CK, CK7, racemase, 
and CD10. It is negative for CK20 and CD117. This supports the given diagnosis. 
COMMENT: Tumor extends to the parenchymal edge of specimen A. From pathologic 
examination alone, it is not possible to determine with certainty whether or not the 
portions of the parenchymal edge of specimen A which are involved by tumor are true 
margins or only ""specimen margins"" in which specimen B is the true surgical margin. 
Specimen B is negative for malignancy. Additionally, a substantial portion of tumor is 
less than 0.1 cm from the parenchymal edge of specimen A; this area appears 
significantly larger than the aggregate size of all the tissue in specimen B. The margin 
status in this report was given following telephone conversation with  
who stated that the pertinent specimen for establishing the margin in 
question (parenchymal margin) is specimen B.

SPECIMEN/GROSS DESCRIPTION 
SOURCE: Left partial kidney nephrectomy 
The specimen is received fresh from the OR labeled ""left partial 
nephrectomy."" It consists of a 49 gram, 4.7 x 4.3 x 4.3 cm rubbery ovoid 
wedge renal parenchyma. The intact, smooth capsular surface with thin fatty 
adhesions is inked blue and the predominantly smooth, focally coarse 
resection margin is inked black. The tissue is serially cross sectioned and 
the cut surfaces display a 4.3 x 4 x 4 cm tumor bulging the capsule and 
located less than 0.1 cm from the black inked margin. A representative 
section of the margin is frozen on one block. 
INTRAOPERATIVE PATHOLOGY CONSULTATION WITH FROZEN SECTION: ""Papillary renal 
cell carcinoma forming a 4.3 cm greatest dimension tumor, .om letely 
excised. Margin is negative for malignancy."" is rendered by -The cut surfaces of the tumor are yellow, tan, red, variegated and vaguely 
lobulated with a thin fibrous capsule. The tumor constitutes at least 90% 
of the specimen volume. The scant renal parenchyma at the periphery of the 
margin is grossly unremarkable. 
Representative sections to include all of the closest black inked renal 
margin are submitted in nine cassettes as follows: 
1. Frozen section residue

FINAL SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT
Kidney;Left
Clinical History/Operative Dx•
Renal mass
Gross Description:
The specimen is labeled left kidney and is received without fixative. It consists of a nephrectomy specimen
which together perinephric fat weighs 627 grams. It measures 20 cm from superior to inferior, 10 cm from
medial to lateral, and 9 cm from anterior to. posterior. Along the anterior surface there is lobulated fatty
tissue and there is a bulging fluctuant mass at the inferior pole of the kidney. At the hilum the renal artery
and renal vein are identified. The vessels are opened and show no gross evidence of intraluminal tumor.
Extending from the hilum of the kidney there is an 8 cm segment of ureter which appears somewhat
attenuated. The ureter is opened to reveal smooth tan-white urothelium. The kidney is bivalved to reveal
a fluid filled cystic mass in the inferior pole which bulges anteriorly this cystic mass measures 6 x 8 x 52
cm. It contains amorphous brown material and turbid fluid. The lining of the cyst Is brown with patchy
small areas of yellow discoloration. The cyst is 1.3 cm from the hitum of the kidney. It appears contained
within the renal capsule and is separated from the anterior surface of the kidney by a thin layer of smooth
fascial tissue. Representative sections of the mass are obtained for research purposes. The remaining
kidney has pale red parenchyma and normal appearing medullary rays. Cortical thickness is 0.8 cm. There
are scattered fluid filled cysts within the cortical portion of the kidney which are up to 1.3 cm. No other
discrete masses are present. Serial sections of the perineural adipose tissue reveal no grossly obvious
lymph nodes and no identifiable adrenal tissue. Representative sections are submitted.
Section summary:
Al) surgical margin, renal artery, renal vein and ureter,
A2) additional sections of ureter and ureteral pelvic junction,
A3) anterior surface of lower pole kidney including possible Gerota's fascia,
A4-A6) additional representative sections of cyst,
A7) cyst and closest approach to hilum,
AB) uninvolved kidney.

COMMENTS:
Sections of the adrenal gland demonstrate adrenal cortical hyperplasia with extensive hemorrhage and focal necrosis within the medullary component A
single nodule of clear cell proliferation which is well vascularized is noted and because of the histologic features immunohistochemical stains are
performed With the following results
RCC: Positive.
cola Positive.
Vimentin :Positive.
Based on the immunohistochemical results and the H&E findings the f e a t u r e s of the adrenal nodule are m o s t consistent with those o f metastatic rena€ a
carcinoma.

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:
Sections of the grossly identified renal tumor show
carcinoma with papillary morphology. The tumor is
characterized by multinodular growth and tumor cells with
moderately pleomorphic medium to large oval nuclei with
occasional nuclear grooves and ample eosinophilic to
vacuolated cytoplasm. In areas the papillary formations are
densely packed'and essentially solid. There is multifocal
intratumoral hemosiderin and formation of cystic nodules
filled with papillary tumor and blood. Tumor abuts the
fibrous renal capsule, but does not clearly invade perirenal
fat on multiple levels examined. There is invasion of small
non-muscularized veins in the renal sinus but no definitive
invasion of the renal sinus fat or large branches of the
renal vein.
The tumor is associated with a significant and extensive
diffuse and nodular lymphocytic infiltrate at the periphery
of the lesion that also extensively involve perinephric and
renal sinus fat, and show sheets and nodules of cells
extensively involve the remaining non-carcinomatous renal
cortex. These are monomorphic-appearing small lymphocytes,
and by immunohistochemistry are diffusely positive for CD20
and BCL-2. The same B cells are negative for CD5 and CD23,
which highlights residual germinal center dendritic cells.
CD3 and CD5 show staining in a smaller population of T
lymphocytes. BCL-6 and cyclin D1 are negative.
Sections of the omental nodule show a spherical accessory
spleen with relatively normal splenic architecture and small
periarterial lymphoid nodules. The adipose tissue
surrounding the splenule is involved by dense sheets and
nodules of the same lymphoid infiltrate with identical immunophenotype to the kidney. Thel eft pelvic lymph node
shows involvement by both metastatic papillary carcinoma and
the same abnormal lymphoid population, with near complete
effacement of residual normal nodal architecture in the

non-carcinomatous areas. Positive and negative control
slides are appropriate.
DIAGNOSIS BASED ON GROSS AND MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:
A. Kidney, left, radical nephrectomy:
- Papillary renal cell carcinoma (histologic type 2), 5.5 cm
in greatest dimension.
- Carcinoma is confined to the kidney, without invasion of
renal sinus fat, muscularized branches of the renal vein, or
perinephric fat.
- Carcinoma shows invasion of small non-muscularized vessels
in renal sinus.
- Small B-cell lymphoma most consistent with extranodal
marginal zone lymphoma, with diffuse involvement of kidney,
perinephric fat, and renal sinus.
- Ureter, vascular, and soft tissue resection margins are
negative for carcinoma.
- See
B. Omentum, excisional biopsy of mass:
- Accessory spleen, with surrounding adipose tissue involved
by small B-cell lymphoma.
C. Lymph node, left pelvic, excision:
- One lymph node, involved by both metastatic papillary
renal cell carcinoma and small B-cell lymphoma.

ADDENDUM REPORT:
This addendum i s issued to clarify the surgical margins status. This case was discussed with Dr. Per Dr.
the specimen submitted as deep margin (8) was taken from the left lateral tumor (specimen C).The left lateral tumor is not transec ted in the histologic
sections examined .Multiple satellite foci (greater than 10) are noted in the renal parenchyma surrounding the three main lesions in specimen C-E. Some
of these satellite lesions measure less than 1 mm. Therefore it is possible that the deep margin tumor in specimen B represents a separate focus of
tumorrather than a positive margin from the left lateral tumor since the left lateral tumor was not transacted.A conversation with Dr also
reveals that the upper pole tumor ( 0) was adherent to the specimen submitted as left cyst wall (A). The upper pole tumor showed a ►+ a►ea of capsular
retraction with ink focally extending to the tumor .This additional information from Dr. lakes it likely that this area of concern was the site of the
adherent cyst and therefore does not represent a true margin.
in summary, no tumor transection is noted ,however ,this patient is at increased risk for recurrence due to the numerous small satellite lesions noted.

Electronic signature: Histologic sections show numerous foci of papillary renal cell carcinoma .Each of the resections including the left lateral ,upper pole, and lower poles
excisions demonstrate a dominant primary tumor with multiple smaller foci within the adjacent renal parenchyma .The separately submitted deep margin(specimen B )also demonstrates similar morphology consistent with papillary renal cell carcinoma. The cyst wall Is negative for tumor.
Specimen 0 (upper pole tumor )demonstrates tumor extending to the inked outer /capsular surface ,however the capsule appears to have retracted in this
area and the presence of ink at the tumor is interpreted as a retraction artifact and not a true positive capsular/soft tissue margin.

x 9 em. In the superior aspect of the perinephric fat is the adrenal 
gland measuring 3 x 2.5 x 1.3 em and it is grossly normal appearing. No 
lymph nodes are found in the attached fat. At the hilum, there is a 10.5 
x 0.5 em segment of ureter which is opened and is normal appearing. The 
vascular margins are free of any lesions or masses. The specimen is 
bivalved and the kidney itself measures 12.5 x 7.5 x 4.7 em. In the lower 
pole of the kidney there is a large round tumor measuring 6.5 x 5.0 x 4.0 
em. The lesion pushes on the capsule and grossly approaches the inferior 
and middle. However, no gross invasion is found. Representative sections 
of the tumor are submitted for frozen section consultation in 1FS. The 
second lesion is found in the mid lateral aspect of the kidney and 
measures 1.4 x 1.4 x 1.2 em and is orangish-brown in color and soft. This 
lesion is 2 em from the above mentioned mass. Further sectioning through 
the supe1ior pole discloses an ill-defined circumscribed potential lesion 
that measures 0.8 x 0.8 em and may represent a third tumor. The supe1ior

CYTOGENETIC ANALYSIS REPORTS 
KARYOTYPE: 
Abnormal mosaic  karyotype: 44,X,-Y,-1,+7,-14,+20,-21[8]/46,XY[12) 
RESULTS: 
The renal mass was sent to a commercial laboratory for cytogenetic 
analysis. 
The chromosomes from the cells of nine-and ten-day adherent cultures were 
counted and analyzed, and two of these metaphases were karyotyped by G­
banding. Eight cells had a modal chromosome number of 44 and were 
characteiized by the loss of chromosomes Y, 1, 14, and 21 and gain of 
chromosomes 7 and 20. Twelve cells had a modal chromosome number of 
46 and appem·ed to have a normal karyotype. Cytogenetic abnormalities 
involving the numeiicalloss of chromosomes Y and 1, often without 
additional changes, have been reported in renal oncocytomas.

Gross Description: Received fresh for frozen section diagnosis is a kidney 
with attached perinephric fat weighing 1988.28 gm and measming 24 x 14.5 
x 11.5 em. Examination of the hilum reveals the vascular resection 
margins. Grossly, the ureter appears to insert in the region of the lower 
pole. The venous resection margin appears to be free of tumor; however, 
upon opening the vein, adherent tumor thrombus is identified. No tumor is 
present at the resection margin itself. Bivalving the kidney reveals a 
large, yellow-orange and hemorrhagic tumor occupying the majority of the 
kidney. There is some recognizable renal parenchyma identified in the 
lower pole of the kidney. The tumor measures approximately 12 x 9.5 x 9 
em. A representative section of the tumor is submitted for frozen section 
analysis. The frozen residue will be submitted for pe1manent analysis. A 
section of the tumor is submitted for cytogenetic analysis. Sectioning 
through the remainder of the specimen reveals tumor invading into 
perinephric fat, grossly 2 mm from the inked margin. An adrenal gland is 
identified measuring approximately 9 x 2 x 0.5 em. There is a nodule 
within the adrenal measuring 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.3 em. The specimen is 
dissected for lymph nodes and possible lymph nodes are submitted.

DIAGNOSIS: Right Renal Mass 
KARYOTYPE: Abnmmal karyotype: 42-44,XY,-6,-8[cp5] 
RESULTS: The renal mass was sent to a commercial laboratory for 
cytogenetic analysis. Only five 111etaphases were available for chromosome 
count and analysis, and two of these metaphases were karyotyped by 
G-banding. All five cells were abnmmal with loss of chromosomes 6 and 8. 
The karyotype description is a composite, listing only the consistent 
clonal changes. Loss of chromosomes 6 and 8 has been reported in a 
variety of renal tumors including renal cell carcinoma and renal sarcoma.

yellowish-orange and normal appearing. The inferior pole of the kidney is 
bulging. At the hilum, there is an 8 em segment of nmmal appearing 
ureter. The specimen is bivalved. The vessels are normal appearing. The 
kidney itself measures approximately 15 x 7 x 6.5 em and the fat is 
difficult to remove. Dissection through the fat discloses no suspicious 
lesions, masses, or lymph nodes. In the lower pole of the kidney there is 
a yellowish-orange lobulated mass measuring 9 x 6 x 6 em. The mass 
comprises approximately 55% of the kidney and is bulging into the renal 
pelvis. The tumor also bulges on the capsule, however, no gross invasion 
is identified. The tumor has an appreciable amount of calcifications and 
obliterates the inferior calix and distorts the central calix and renal

Addendum Diagnosis 
The cytogenetic analysis (  reveals a normal karyotype. 
The histomorphology is that of an atypical oncocytoma, however, foci of 
the tumor are strongly positive for colloidal iron, and many cells are 
positive for CK7. Thus, an oncocytic neoplasm with low malignant 
potential is favored, which is a borderline neoplasm between oncocytoma 
and chromophobe carcinoma.

and grossly free of lesions or masses. The kidney is sectioned disclosing 
a 4.0 x 3.5 x 2.7 em soft orange mass having a moderate amount of 
hemOIThage and possible degenerative changes. It is difficult to tell 
whether the tumor is through the capsule however, the lesion does push 
well into the hilum and renal pelvis. The calyceal system and vessels m·e 
uninvolved by lesion. Elsewhere, two small simple cysts [cortical cysts] 
containing clear thin fluid are found measuring 0.9 and 1.0 em. Both

DIAGNOSIS: Right Renal Mass 
KARYOTYPE: Abnonnal  karyotype: 46,Y,t(X;l)(p11.2;p34)[cp21] 
RESULTS: The renal mass was harvested after seven and nine days in 
culture. The chromosomes from 21 metaphases were counted and analyzed, 
 and three of these metaphases were karyotyped by G-banding. The modal 
chromosome number was 46, and all the cells had a balanced translocation 
between the p arms of chromosomes X and 1. This translocation juxtaposed 
the TFE3 gene at Xpl1.2 with the PSF gene at 1 p34. The expression of the 
resulting fusion gene, PSF-TFE3, in renal epithelial cells has been 
repotted to play a role in the development of renal cell carcinoma (please 
see the addendum to the Surgical Pathology Report). "," Site: Right kidney and adrenal gland
Laterality: Right
Histology: Renal cell carcinoma with clear cell and papillary patterns, X;1 translocation
Stage: pT2, no lymph node involvement (N0), metastasis not detected (Mx)

Behavior: Malignant

Justification: The tissue was labeled as ""hernia sac"" but further examination revealed a renal cell carcinoma with clear cell and papillary patterns, along with a translocation between chromosomes X and 1. This finding supports the diagnosis of malignant renal cell carcinoma. The stage is determined based on the size of the tumor and the absence of lymph node involvement or metastasis.

chromosome 7, and a missing chromosome 21  chromosome. Papillary 
renal adenomas and carcinomas have been reported to contain a unique 
 combination of autosomal trisomies along with loss of chromosome. 
The constellation of trisomies includes chromosomes 7, 12, 16, 17, and 20, 
all of which are found in this patient' s karyotype. The literature 
suggests that tumors with tri-or tetrasomy 7 and 17 correspond to

The chromosomes from these metaphases were counted and analyzed, and four 
of the metaphases were karyotyped by G-banding. All the cells contained 
numerical chromosome abnormalities that are listed in the karyotypic 
description above. The extra copies of chromosomes 16, 17, and 20 and the 
missing chromosome have all been reported in papillary renal cell 
carcinoma (PRCC). Although only one cell contained an extra copy of 
chromosome 7, this is a significant finding in PRCC.

GROSS DESCRIPTION 
The specimen is submitted fresh as ""left kidney and ureter"" and consists 
of a kidney removed with attached perirenal fat weighing 361 grams with an 
overall dimension of 19 x 11 x 5 em. The kidney measures 10 x 6 x 3.5 ern. 
The segment of attached ureter measures 8 ern in length and 0.6 em in 
diameter. There are several segments of vessel at the hilum ranging in 
length from 0.4 to 1.5 em in length and measuring up to 2 em in diameter. 
The ureteral mucosa is pale tan with the usual striations. The pelvic 
mucosa is similar in appearance. The renal parenchyma is red brown with 
normal architecture. There is a 2 x 2.2 x 1.5 em circumscribed yellow tan 
tumor adjacent to the renal pelvis which appears to abut upon the 
renal sinus and approaches to within 0.5 em of the cortical surface. The 
calyces are not dilated. The cortex measures up to 0.8 em in thickness. 
The capsule strips easily revealing an underlying red brown granular 
cortical surface. Examination of the attached perirenal fat is 
unrem0rkable. The adrenal gland is absent. Representative sections are

SURGICAL PROCEDURES:
NEPHRECTOMY
The specimen is submitted fresh as ""left kidney"" and consists of a kidney
removed with attached adrenal gland and segment of ureter. The specimen
has an overall dimension of 20 x 13 x 5 cm and a weight of 567 grams. The
isolated kidney measures 12.5 x 5.5 x 5 cm. The capsule is removed with
ease revealing a pink tan granular surface interrupted by a 4 x 3 x 2.5 cm
serous cyst at the upper pole. There are two ligated vessels at the hilum
ranging in length from 0.7 to 1.5 cm in length and measuring 0.6 and 0.4
cm in diameter respectively. The segment of attached ureter measures 7 cm
in length and 0.3 cm in diameter at the margin of resection. The ureter
and pelvis are red tan and glistening. Upon opening, the ureteral mucosa
is pink tan with the usual striations. The pelvic mucosa is pink tan and
unremarkable. Adjacent to the capsular cyst at the lower portion of the
upper is a moderately firm red-yellow, focally hemorrhagic, relatively
circumscribed tumor measuring 2 x 2.7 x 2.2 cm which extends to the rim of
the cortex and protrudes into the surrounding perirenal fat. The tumor
does not grossly invade the subjacent pelvis. The remaining renal
parenchyma is pink tan and unremarkable. The cortex measures 0.8 cm in
maximum thickness.
The attached adrenal gland measures 7 x 2 x 1.5 cm and weighs 7 grams.
There is no gross involvement by tumor. Examination of the attached
perirenal fat is unremarkable. No grossly apparent nodes are seen.
Representative sections are submitted, multiple (12) labeled as follows:
Cassette 1:

The specimen shows poorly differentiated malignant neoplasm with vacuolated clear abundant cytoplasm. Tumor cells 
stain positively for vimentin, pan CK (focal), CD68, RCC (focal), and negatively for TTF-1, Mel an A, S1 00, CD34, and 
desmin. The immunostain study support carcinoma diagnosis of non-lung origin, due to negativity TTF-1. The positivity 
of vimentin and CD68 is seen in malignant fibrous histiocytoma. However, the positivity of vimentin, pan CK and RCC 
immunostains suggests metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Recommend clinical and radiological correlation.

COMMENT: 
The tumor is composed of two histological patterns: the typical chromophobe celi type renal celi adenocarcinoma is 
juxtaposed to a high-grade sarcomatoid pattern. The chromophobe celi and the sarcomatoid areas occupies 
approximately 40% and 60% of the total tumor volume, respectively. Immunostaining is performed and the results will be 
reported in an addendum to confirm the chromophobe component. 
Addendum '. 
Special and immunostaining reveal that the chromophobe compone.nt of the tumor is posltiv7 for Ha.le's C~lIoid iron, EMA 
and focally for CAM 5.2. Our diagnosis is not changed by these findings. Therefore, the prevIously hsted final dIagnosis 
(see below) should be considered our final report. With this report, our st\.ldy of this case is now completed. Thank you

This tumor has an unusal morphology with areas closely resembling clear cell type carcinoma which are admixed with 
additional more high grade spindle cell components including those with tumor nuclei that are markedly enlarged, with 
macronuclei, Irregular nuclear shapes and pleomorphism. In addition, there are areas with glandular formation, 
remniscent of an ""intestinal"" type morphology. Taken together, these are unusual histological findings.

COMMENT: 
Part 3 is composed of a nodule of renal cell carcinoma with surrounding fibromuscular and adipose tissue. There are no 
lymphocytes and no suggestion of lymph node architecture. Lymph node involvement cannot therefore be confirmed 
histologically and this nodule is favored to represent either a soft tissue deposit or an intravascular nodule of tumor. The 
deposit In the adrenal gland is separate form the main tumor mass and Is therefore considered a metastatic' deposit. The 
pathologic stage is therefore rendered as pT3b Nx M1.

METASTATIC RENAL CELL CARCINOMA. SEE COMMENT. 
Comment: 
The aspirates are pauci-cellular and reveal rare small clusters of malignant epithelial cells in a background of blood. Only rare 
reactive bronchial cells and sparse inflammatory cells are present. The tumor cells are large with abundant granular cytoplasm and 
well defined cell borders. The nuclei are enlarged and mildly pleomorphic with moderately Irregular contours, coarse chromatin 
and prominent central nucleoli. The morphologic findings are consistent with a renal cell carcinoma. To confirm the diagnosis and 
help exclude a primary lung tumor, we performed a panel of immunohistochemical stains on the cell block material with the 
following resulls: 
Antibody 
CD10 
Pan-keratin 
CK7 
CK20 
RCC 
CD68

The immunohistochemical staining pattern supports the morphologic diagnosis. Positive staining for CD1 0 and pan keratin with 
negative staining for CK 20 is consistent with renal cell carcinoma. Although CK7 is often negative in most renal cell carcinomas, 
positive staining can be seen in up to 1/3 of cases. Similarly, negative staining for ReC is seen in approximately 13% of cases. 
Negative staining for CD68 indicated the tumor cells are not reactive pulmonary macrophages which can have similar morphology 
in rare cases. Negative staining for TTF-1 also rules against a diagnosis of a primary lung carcinoma. Overall, based on 
. the final diagnosis is that of metastatic renal cell carcinoma.

The adrenal gland shows a cystic lesion, composed of cle-ar cells. The fibrovascular pattern, and the morphology of the 
tumor cells, strongly suggest an origin In the kidney. · 
A panel of immunohistochemical stains was performed on a section from the tumor in the kidney as well as the tumor in 
the adrenal gland. The primary renal cell carcinoma is positive for pan cytokeratin and RCC tumor marker. The primary 
tumor shows aberrant expression of inhibin. The tumor is focally positive for vimentin. The tumor is negative for 
cytokeratin 7, cytokeratin 20, throglobulin and thyroid transcription factor (TTF). This immunphistochemical profile is

COMMENT : 
Parts 1 and 2: This renal tumor Is very large with gross invasion Into the perinephric adipose tissue. and with Ihe 
Gerota's fascia stretched over the tumor. A 0.15 cm defect Is prasentln a section conlaining apparent Gerola's faSCia in 
the upper pole region, with carcinoma present at Ihe corresponding Inked margin (slide 1 F). It is not certain whether or 
not the tumor has invaded through Garota's fascia Into surrounding 60ft tissue, or whether this represen ts ~ 
surgical defect in Gerow's fascia; therefore , the assigned pT stage is pT3a+. The case was discussed with 
who indicated that he noted a small defect in the this area of the specimen during intraoperative examination , an _ 
)thought there was a small amount of residual tumor In the corresponding adjacent tissue near Ihe adrenal gland. He 
then resected the adrenal gland and surrounding soft tissue. No tumor was recognized grossly In the adrenal specimen 
(part 2) during pathologic examination and se<:tlonlng; the remaining tissue in part 2 will be submitted for histology, wlth 
ttie result to follow In an addendumr It is mO$t likely that the final margin in the 60ft tiuue adjacent to the upper pole of 
the kidney Is benign. 
-The small tumor fragment in the main renal artery lumen (section 1A) was not Identified grossly, and is not attached 10 
the wan of the artery. However, the tumo~ cells are surrounded by fibrin. It is not certain whether this represents a tumor 
thromboembolus or an artifaclually displaced tumor fragment occurring during sectioning . The renal artery wall margin 
appears to be free of tumor. 
GROSS DESCRIPTION : 
The specimen is received in two parts. 
~ is received fresh, properly labeled and identified with the paUe~t's ~ame ~ s. ""ri.ght kidney'"". The speCimen 
conSists of a kidney surrounded by adipose tissue. On external examination the~ ~lCl<lIS slrete~ed and smooln. On

and the medulla, compresses the renal pelvis and extends into the perlnephnc <lnd hdar adlpo~e tissue. O.n se~al sectioning . most 
of the tumor is homogenous ly beige and soft. Yellow foci and areas of hemorrhage and nee.rosls are ~Iso Identified. The

Molecular fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis demonstrates presence of trisomy of chromosomes 7 and 17 
in both the papillary as well as the clear cell areas of this morphologically complex renal cell carcinoma, In addition the 
papillary areas also show foci with tatrasomy of chromosome 17, ' 
This mOlecular phenotype is most consistent with a papillary renal cell carcinoma,

Interpretation guidelines: 
Chromosomal losses are considered significant if present in greater than 30% of cells. The loss is indeterminate if present in 20-
30% of cases, The loss is considered artifactual if seen In less than 20% of cases, 
Chromosomal gains are cons',dered significant if present in greater than 20% of cells, The gain is considered artifactual if seen in 
less than 20% of cases, 
Probes used: CEP1 (1p11,1q11,1), CEP7 (7p11,1q11,1), CEP17 (17p11,1q11,1). 
At least 25 cells are analyzed. The Signal distribution for targeted foci of renal carcinOma is recorded, If the test results are not 
consistent with the ciin',cal findings, andlor diagnostic, a consultation between pathologist and treating physician is warranted. 
This test was d8ve.o ad and its performance characteristics determined by the University of Pittsburgh, Department of Pathology, 
as required bv the regulations,

The renal cell carcinoma shows prominent necrosis. In addition, the tumor has a mixed morphology with papillary and 
clear cell features, The exact charecterizatlon of this lesion will be perfonned after molecular testing has been 
accomplished, The results of the molecular tests, as well as their interpretation, will be reported in an addendum, 
The non-neoplastiC renal parenchyma distant from the tumor is unremarkable, However, the peritumoral r&nal 
parenchyma shows prominent glomerular sclerosis and focal areas of intersijtial inflammation, Clinical and serologic 
correlation is suggested,

COMMENT: 
Part 3; I am aware that this patient underwent recent left partial nephrectomy for a conventional (clear cell) renal cell 
carcinoma which was staged as pathologic stage pT1b Nx Mx. If the carcinoma in the right kidney (current resection) is 
an independent primary, then the pathologic stage of the right renal tumor is pT1b Nx Mx. The possibility that the right 
and left tumors represent primary and metastatic lesions cannot be entirely excluded, but this is less likely. If requested, 
mutational genotyping of the left and right tumors may be performed to compare the mutational profiles of these tumors, 
to more objectively determine whether they are more likely to be independent or related. 
Part 4; The specimen part number 4 labeled ""eleventh rib"" has been subjected to a gross examination only, If it is desired 
that this specimen be processed for additional stUdies, particularly microscopic examination, it is suggested that the 
case pathologist be notified within two weeks of the slgnout date of this report. This Is particularly important as 
specimens are routinely discarded .after a prescribed period of time.  A, Side: 1 1, Right

The tumor cells show prominent eosinophilia and focal areas of necrosis. The Fuhrman nuclear grade ranges bettiiesr+: 2
and 3 .Some of the Fuhrman grade 2 areas with fibrohistiocytic cores resemble type t papillary renal cell carcinoma, t ut
overall a diagnosis of type 2 papillary renal call carcinoma is favored.
lmmunohistochemical stains are performed with adequate controls and demonstrate that the tumor cells are strongly
positive for p504s and AE1 /3 and show focal I patchy positivity forCK7 ,CAa, and EMA. These findings support the
above diagnosis.

COMMENT:
Part 2 :The renal mass consists of an oncocytic epithelial neoplasm with prominent foamy macrophages and
hemosiderin laden macrophages associated with hemorrhage .The epithelial cells are arranged In solid, acinar, and
focally papillary .architectures .The neoplastic calls have large nuclei with prominent nucleoli and round nuclear
contours .A limited panel of Immunohistochemical stains is performed .The neoplastic cells are strongly immunoreactive
for P504S (alpha -methylacyl CoA racemase )and are negative for cytokeratin 7 and carbonic anhydrase IX. Parvalbumin
immunostain is equivocal ,with a high background .The overall pathology favors a type 2 papillary renal call carcinoma.
Parts I and 2: The renal cell carcinoma Is focally present at the capsular resection margin In an area where the capsule is
not intact (?capsular incision )and the parenchymal resection margin on the partial nephrectomy specimen. A
microscopic detached fragment of carcinoma is present in the fat overlying the tumor (part 1). it is uncertain whether any
microscopic residual carcinoma is present .Clinical /radiologic follow -up is recommended.

COMMENT:This tumor has an interesting morphology with a papillary architecture but in areas has elongated and angulated tubular
growth pattern reminiscent of mucinous and tubular spindle cell carcinoma .No distinct mucin is identified and there are
many foam cells In the background .Immunostains were performed and show that tumor cells are positive for CK7 and
racemase ,focally positive for CD10 and negative for CA(. While we favor this to represent a papillary renal cell carcinoma,
our differential diagnosis also includes an unusual variant of mucinous tubular spndle cell carcinoma.

Interpretation
MOLECULAR ANATOMIC PATHOLOGY FLUORESCENCE IN SITU HYBRIDIZATION ANALYSIS
Comment :Fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH) tests show monosomy of chromosome I and 2 In approximately 66%
and 54% of the tumor cells .Trisomy of chromosome 17 Is seen In 25% of tumor cells.
This FISH profile is suggestive of a mucinous tubular and spindle cell carcinoma .However a papillary renal cell
carcinoma cannot be ruled out.
Specimen type: Renal tumor.
Result:
1Signal 2 Signals 3 or more Signals
CEP1 40(65.6%) 21(34.4%) 0(0%)
CEP2 36(53.7%) 29(43.3%) 2(3.0%)
CEP7 13(21.3%) 44(72.1%) 4(6.6%)
CEP17 11(18.0%) 35(57.4%) 15(24.6%)
Abnormality detected:
Monosomy of chromosome I and 2 Is seen in approximately 66% and 54 %of the tumor calls. Trisomy of chromosome 17
is seen in 25% of tumor cells.
Interpretation guidelines:
Chromosomal losses are considered significant if present in greater than 30% of cells. Theloss is indeterminate if present in
20-30% of cases .The loss is considered artifactual if seen in less than 20% of cases.
Chromosomal gains are considered significant if present in greater than 20% of cells. The gain is considered artifactual if seen in
less than 20% of cases.
Results
Probes used .CEP1 (1p11.1g11.1), CEP2 (2p11.1g11.2), CEP7 (7p11.1g11.1), CEP17 (17p11.1g11.1).
At least 25 cells are analyzed .The signal distribution for targeted foci of renal carcinoma is recorded. If the test results are not
consistent with the clinical findings,and/or diagnostic, a consultation between pathologist and treating physician is warranted.
This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the Department of Pathology,
as required by the CLIA' 88 regulations.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION 
Histologic type: Mixed papillary renal cell carcinoma and clear 
cell renal cell carcinoma, approximately 50% of each tumor type. 
Histologic grade (Fuhrman Nuclear Grade) : Both tumor types are 
grade II 
Primary tumor (pT) : Tumor measures 5 em in greatest dimension with 
no extension beyond the kidney identified (pT1b) 
Margins of resection: Negative for tumor

Non-neoplastic kidney: Chronic interstitial inflammation is present 
and some benign cysts are present 
and 
as Other findings: To delineate the two tumor types, CK7, EMA, RCC 
PAX2 immunohistochemical stains were evaluated on tissue block 3 
where the two tumor types are both present. The 
papillary renal cell carcinoma area is very 
strongly positive for cytokeratin 7 and there is a 
lack of cytokeratin 7 staining in the clear cell 
carcinoma area and this helps support the 
interpretation of the two tumor types being 
present. The EMA staining is stronger in the 
papillary area than in the clear cell area. The 
RCC staining is also somewhat stronger in the 
papillary area. The PAX2 staining is similar.

Clinical Information
Renal cancer
Gross Description
Received fresh and subsequently fixed in formalin labeled ""right
kidney"" is a 406 g kidney which is predominant covered with abundant
yellow lobular fat measuring 15 x 11 x 5.5 cm. (Weight and measurements
including fat). The specimen shows no discrete adrenal gland. There is
a 4.0 cm long ureter. The specimen is bivalved to show 2.5 x 2.0 x 2.0
cm orange irregular well-circumscribed mass located at the hilum. This
is within 1.2 cm of the stapled hilum. There is an additional pale
yellow irregular nodular lesion measuring 2.7 cm in greatest dimension.
This is well-circumscribed and does not appear to grossly invade
through the capsule. This is located near the periphery of the specimen, approximately 2.8 cm from the hilum and 2 cm from first
described tumor. The remainder of the parenchyma is pink red, smooth
and glistening with a discrete cortical medullary border. No other
discrete gross lesions are identified. No lymph nodes are grossly
identified in the surrounding fat. Representative sections of the
specimen are submitted as follows: 1 - vascular and ureteral margins, 2
- 5- representative tumor to radial margin and normal, 6 - possible
tumor to hilar margin, 7 - representative normal, 8 - 11 -
representative sections of additional tumor to radial margin (capsule)
and normal, 12 - representative section of normal between tumors.

Gross Description: 
Specimen A is additionally labeled ""left renal tumor #1, partial nephrectomy"" and is a 134.6 gram, 7.5 x 7.5 x 
6.5 em partial nephrectomy covered with a small amount of fat. The exposed parenchymal margin is marked with 
black ink and the capsule and perinephric soft tissue is marked with blue ink. The specimen is sectioned to 
demonstrate a well-circumscribed 5.2 em in diameter spherical yellow/brown solid nodule with focal softening and 
hemorrhage. The mass expands the renal capsule but does not appear to extend into the perinephric fat. The 
tumor is well-demarcated from the adjacent renal parenchyma which is remarkable for a 1 em in diameter thin­
walled clear fluid filled cyst (A4). The tumor comes within 0.3 em of the closest black inked parenchymal margin 
and abuts the blue inked perinephric soft tissue in multiple areas but does not appear to go through.

Comment :
Immunohistochemical stains are performed on block A3 and
demonstrate the tumor
is diffusely positive for CD10 while being negative for CK7,
CD15, CD117, and
has faint positivity for racemase. While not entirely specific,
this
immunophenotype is consistent with renal cell carcinoma, clear
cell subtype.
Clinical History:
-year-old male with a left renal mass.
Gross Description:
Received is one appropriately labeled container, additionally
labeled ""left
renal mass."" It holds an 85 gram, 7.5 x 5.1 x 4.2 cm partial
nephrectomy. There
is a small amount of attached perinephric fat. The parenchymal
margin is inked
black, and the perinephric soft tissue margin is inked blue. The
specimen is
sectioned to reveal a 6.7 x 4.1 x 4.1 cm variegated friable
pink/tan mass
expanding the renal capsule and focally abutting the black inked
parenchymal
margin. The surrounding cortex appears compressed and slightly
distorted. The
renal capsule is expanded and there is a 0.6 cm area of pale
white nodularity
(A6), but appears grossly intact. The small amount of attached
perinephric fat
is intact. Tumor is given to Tissue Procurement. Representative sections are submitted of the lesion to include
its relationship
to the black inked parenchymal margin, blue inked capsular
margin, capsule and
adjacent parenchyma.

Gross Description:
Received is one appropriately labeled container, additionally
labeled ""left kidney."" It holds a 1,220 gram, 25 x 12.0 x 10.0
cm nephrectomy specimen. The perinephric fat is inked blue.
Within the fat there is a 16.2 x 8.0 x 8.0 cm kidney. Within the
lower pole there is an 8.0 x 7.2 x 7.0 cm tan/yellow/red
firm, well circumscribed, variegated mass. The mass bulges the
capsule, but does not grossly appear to invade through it. The
majority of the mass is solid (90%) with the remaining 10% being
cystic. The cysts are filled with dark brown liquid. There are
no white myxoid areas grossly noted. The mass does not invade
into the sinus fat or involve the pelvis. The remainder of the
kidney parenchyma is red/brown with a distinct corticomedullary
junction. The renal vein artery and ureter are all patent. The
adrenal gland is not grossly identified.

However, information about the size of the tumor and its relationship with surrounding structures is not provided, making it difficult to determine the stage. The left peri-aortic lymph node excision showed no evidence of malignancy, but this does not exclude the possibility of nodal involvement by the renal cell carcinoma. Therefore, the behavior is classified as malignant based on the diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

a nephrectomy specimen with an overall dimension of 24.0 x 14.0 x 11.0 em. The vascular and ureteral margins are Identified and 
uninvolved by tumor. A portion of adrenal gland at the superior pole of the kidney, measuring 1.5 em in greatest dimension is 
identified and is unremarkable. The lower pole of I he kidney demonstrates a bulging mass. A Jongtitudinal section through the 
specimen demonstrates a large, orange-yellow, soft to firm mass arising from the lower pole of the kidney, measuring 11.5 em in 
greatest dimension. Areas of hemorrhage and focal necrosis are also Identified. The periureteral junction superior to the mass 
appears to be somewhat dilated. The tumor penetrates through the renal capsule and Is predominantly present in the perirenal 
fat. Sections through the tumor demonstrates that the tumor comes to less than 1 mm to the perirenal fat surgical margin. No

1) The specimen is received fresh, labeled, ""Left kidney, adrenal gland, perinephric fat and renal vein thrombus"". It consists 
of a radical nephrectomy specimen composed of a kidney, adrenal gland and perinephric adipose tissue, weighing 330 grams and 
measuring 13.2 x 9.8 x 3.4 em. The external surface is inked black. The upper half of the kidney is replaced by an Ill-defined, 
vaguely, lobulated, variegated tumor mass, measuring 6.8 x 5.7 x 3.2 em, located 1.1 em from the adrenal gland. The tumor 
extends into the renal vein from which the tumor grows distally as an exophytic polypoid mass, measuring 3.6 em in length. The 
tumor also extends into the pelvis. However, grossly ureter margin and vascular margins are free of tumor. The tumor appears 
to extend to, but not through, the overlying renal capsule. On cut sections, the tumor is yellow-tan, friable tissue with multiple 
cystic degeneration and necrosis. The remaining kidney appears to be unremarkable. The adrenal gland measures 4.2 x 2.0 x 
0.7 em, and is unremarkable. No lymph nodes are identified in the perinephric adipose tissue, therefore, representative sections 
are submitted for histology. Photographs are taken. Small samples are given to TPS.

hemorrhagic cortico-medullary tumor measuring 6.9 x 4.9 x 4.0 em. The tumor is situated in the upper pole of the kidney, and 
grossly impinges the sinus fat and renal pelvis, but does not show any definite invasion. The adjacent vessels appear grossly free 
of tumor. The tumor bulges inlo !he perinephric fat, which shows possible tumor involvement. Sections through the remainder of 
I he kidney reveal a pink brown parenchyma, with a well·defined cortlco-medullary junction. There is a cyslic area identified 
measuring 1.1 x 1 .0 em, which is lined by unremarkable brown renal parenchyma and filled with clear fluid. The cortex measures 
3.0 em and the calyces appear normal. On complete opening of the ureter, renal pelvis, and collecting ducts, they show smooth

"," Site: Left kidney, distal pancreas, spleen, left adrenal gland, para-aortic lymph nodes, left psoas muscle
Laterality: Left
Histology: Not completely specified in the description, but a large tumor is mentioned in the kidney, which might be a renal cell carcinoma. The involvement of adjacent organs and lymph nodes suggests a possible advanced stage.
Stage: Not provided (TNM staging would require additional information)
Grade: Not provided (This would typically require histologic examination)
Behavior: Malignant, as the tumor shows local invasion and lymph node involvement.

The description is not sufficient to provide complete answers for all categories, especially stage and grade, which usually require histopathological examination. The mention of a large mass with local invasion and lymph node involvement suggests a malignant process, most likely a renal cell carcinoma based on the location. However, without further information, staging and grading cannot be accurately determined.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2).Tha specimen Is received fresh, labeled ""left kidney, adrenal gland and lymph nodes"" and consists of a kidney with attached 
ureter, renal vessels and perinephric fat weighing 753 g in total. The kidney measures 15.0 x 7.1 x 6.0 em. The attached ureter 
measures 10.1 em In length and 0.5 em In diameter. The attached renal vein measures 1.5 em In length and .0.9 em In diameter. 
The renal vessels and ureter margins are grossly unremarkable. An adrenal gland Is Identified, measuring 5.9 x 2.0 x 0.9 em. The 
kidney Is inked black and bivalved to reveal a poorly delineated tumor 9.5 x 6.2 x 5.0 em which Is Involving almost all of the upper 
pole of the kidney as well the lower pole. The tumor is Impinging upon the renal pelvis but grossly does not appear to be Involving 
the renal pelvis. Polypoid protrusion of the tumor Is present in the renal vein but the margin of the vein Is grossly negative of 
tumor. The tumor appears to be pushing the renal capsule but does not appear to be grossly Invading the perirenal fat. Sections 
through the remainder of the kidney reveal a pink-brown parenchyma, with a well-defined cortlco-medullary junction. The cortex 
measures 0. 7 em and the calyces appear normal. Multiple lymph nodes are Identified In the perinephric fat. The specimen is 
photographed. Representative sections are submitted for TPS and for permanent sections.

1). The specimen is received fresh, previously Incised and placed in formalin, labeled ""Right kidney"" and consists of a total 
nephrectomy specimen with an attached ureter, renal vessels and perinephric fat, weighing 642 g post fixation. The external 
surface has been inked black. T~e kidney measures 12.5 x 8.3 x 4.6 em. The attached ureter measures 3.3 em in length and 
0.4 em In diameter in greatest dimension. The ureteral margin is identified and appears grossly uninvolved by tumor. On 
opening, the ureter is lined by a pink-ten soft faintly corrugated tissue. The attached renal vessels are identified, with a slight area 
of firmness Identified at the distal aspect of the smeller vessel, and the margins appear grossly uninvolved by tumor. The capsular 
surface is smooth and pink-tan. ihe kidney is bivalved to reveal a pseudo encapsulated yellow-red tumor mass measuring 8.1 x 
7.5 x 4.3 em, occupying the superi,or and mid poles of the kidney, which appears to be partially surrounded by a rim of dense white 
fibrous tissue. The mass appears to focally protrude Into the sinus fat with possible focal invasion, but does not grossly Involve 
the renal pelvis. AI the center of the mass, an Ill-defined firm white-tan focally hemorrhagic scarred area Is Identified measuring 
2.8 x 2.3 em in greatest dimension. Focal areas of necrosis are also identified. The mass abuts the renal calyces and serial 
sectioning reveals possible invasion by soft friable red-tan tumor tissue. The attached perinephric fat has been inked black and on 
cut section reveals a focal area of possible extracapsular exlension into the fat. The Inked margins do not appear to be grossly 
involved by tumor. Sectioning through the remainder of the kidney reveals a pink brown parenchyma, which appears grossly 
unremarkable. The corticomedullary junction is well delineated, with the cortex measuring 0.6 em in width. Sectioning through 
the perinephric fat reveals no grossly identifiable lymph nodes. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted to TPS for 
permanent section and photograp~s have been taken.

Gross Description: 
1). The specimen is received fresh labeled ""right kidney"" and consists of a kidney with attached ureter, renal vessels and 
perinephric fat weighing 912 g In t~tal. The kidney measures 11,0 x 9,0 x 2.0 em. The attached ureter measures 0.5 em in length 
and 0.3 em in diameter. The renal vessels and ureter margins are grossly unremarkable. An adrenal gland Is not identified. The 
kidney is inked black and bivalvedl to reveal a 2.0 x 1.5 x 1.2 cm well-circumscribed tan-brown, hemorrhagic mass. The mass 
does not appear to invade into th~ sinus fat. Sections through the remainder of the kidney reveal a pink brown parenchyma, with a 
welt-defined cortico-medullary junction. The cortex measures 0.5 em and the calyces appear normal. A 0.3 cm lymph node is 
identified in the perinephric fat. The specimen Is photographed. Representative sections are submitted for and for permanent 
sections.

1). The specimen is received fr~sh for frozen section, labeled ""left radical nephrectomy"" and consists of three fragments of a total 
nephrectomy specimen vnth attached ureter, renal vessels and perinephric fat weighing 641 gIn total. The kidney fragments 
measures 8.0 to 10.0 em a greatest dimension. The attached ureter measures 0.4 em in diameter. The attached renal vein 
measures 0.2 em in lenglh and 0.5 em In diameter. The renal vessels and ureter margins are grossly unremarkable. No adrenal 
gland is identified on the specimen. The external surface of the specimen is inked black. Sectioning of the kidney fragments 
reveals a 5.6 x 4.0 x 3.5 em tumor in the mid portion of the kidney. Sectioning through the tumor reveals a light tan to orange to 
maroon soft, variegated cut surfa\;e. Grossly, the tumor appears to extend to the perirenal adipose tissue. The renal capsule is 
noticeable for a 3,5 x 3.0 em retention cyst which Is filled with clear fluid. Sections through the remainder of the kidney reveal e 
pink-brown parenchyma, with a l~ell-deflned cortico-medullary junction. The renal pelvis Is not Identifiable. The cortex measures

I). The specimen is received fresp, labeled ""right kidney and part of adrenal"" and consists of a kidney with attached ureter, renal 
vessels and perinephric fat weighing 780 g in total. A portion of adrenal gland is also present on the specimen which measures 
1.6 x O.g cm. The kidney measures 10.3 x 6 x 5 cm. The attached ureter measures 6.5 cm in length and 0.3 cm in diameter. 
The attached renal vein measures 0.5 cm in length and 1.0 cm in diameter. The renal vessels and ureter margins are grossly 
unremarkable. The kidney Is inked black and bivalved to reveal a 4.6 x 2.7 x 2.5 cm well defined, orange-yellow tumor in the 
upper half of the kidney. Sectioning through the tumor reveats a soft, variegated cut surface. Grossly, the tumor appears to 
extend into the renal vein and abuts but docs not invade the renal petvis. Sections through the remainder of the kidney reveal a 
pink-brown parenchyma, with a well-defined cortico-medullary Junelion. The cortex measures 0.6 cm and the calyces appear 
normal. No _nOdes are identified in the perinephric fat. The specimen is photographed. Representative sections are 
submitted for nd for permanent sections.

length and 3.9 cm in diameter with a protruding mass measuring 6.3 x 5.1 x 3.1 em attached to the wall ofinferior vena cava and 
completely obliterative the renal vein. The portion of renal artery measures 2.7 em long and 0.4 em in diameter. The renal artery 
and ureter margins are grossty unremarkable. An adrenal gland is Identified, measures 5.5 x 3.5 x 1.3 em and grossly appears 
unremarkable. The perinephric fat is of thickness ranging from 0.4 to 1.7 em. The kidney is Inked black and bivalved to reveal an 
Irregular soft mass with variegated appearance, measures 12.2 x 9.8 x 8.9 em, involving the entire upper pole and portion of the 
middle pole of the kidney. The mass appears to involve the perinephric fat, renal sinus and perihilar fat and grossly extends into 
the renal vessels. The pelviealiceal system at the upper pole is completely compressed, while at the middle and 10Vier poles, does 
not appear to be involved by the mass. Two 0.5 em In diameter renal calculi are noted present in the middle pole. The remainder 
of the middle and lower pole shows a muitiloculated cyst 2.4 cm in greatest dimension, which cannot be separated from the upper 
pole mass as no uninvolved renal parenchyma is grossly Identified. Sections through the remainder of the kidney reveal a pink

1 )The specimen is received fresh labeled ""left kidney and proximal ureter"" and consists of a kidney with attached ureter, fenal 
vessels and perinephric fat weighing 645 g in total. The kidney measures 15 .2 x 8 x 5.9 em. The attached ureter measures 2.5 
em In length and 0.5 em in diameter. The attached renal vein measures 3.1 em In length and 1.2 em In diameter. The renal 
vessels and ureter margins are grossly unremarkable. An adrenal gland is not identifed. The kidney is inked black and bivalved to 
reveal a well-circumscribed multi-lobulated yellow golden hemorrhagic mass measuring 7.6 x 6.0 x 5.5 em . The mass Is located 
at the upper pole of the left the kidney and it appears to be abutting and confined wilhln the renal capsule. The renal artery, vein 
and ureters are not Involved by the tumor. The mass invades the renal sinus fat, it is about 1.5 em from the renal hilar fat. Tumor 
grossly has 40% hemorrhage and 20 % necrosis. Sections through the remainder of the kidney reveal a pink brown parenchyma, 
with a well-defined cortico-medultary junction. The cortex measures 0.8cm and the calyces appear nonnal. No lymph nodes are 
Identified in the perinephric fat. Representative sections are submitted for TPS and for permanent sections. Photos are taken.

COMMENT: The tumors in this case exhibit a very unusual constellation of features that do not fit into any of our well defined 
categories . The main tumor mass is predominant ly papillary and solid with focal tubular areas. It is high grade. Focal areas of 
necrosis are evident. In the adjacent renal parenchyma there are innumerable neoplastic foci that have tubular features and 
basophilic cytoplasm. These measure from 3 millimeters to less than 0.1 millimeter . It is these foci of disease that are present at

the parenchyma l margin of resection. The main tumor mass is immunoreactive for CK7 and focally for racemase . 11 is negative for 
CAS. The satellite nodules are immunoreactive for CK7 but negative for racemase. BAF47 is not interpretable. The overall 
appearance is suggestive of a syndrome-associated tumor although the unusual morphology does not allow us to make this 
statement with confidence or to suggest the syndrome involved, if such is the case. Close examination of the contralateral kidney 
is advised. 
Seen in consultation with  
Some of/he immunohistochemistry and ISH les/$ were developed and their performance characteristics were determined by the Department of

COMMENT
The tumor is present as a bulging nodule in a large caliber vascularspace at the parenchymal margin of resection extending to the inkedsurface indicated by the surgeon.  The immunohistochemical stain forCD31 (vascular marker) highlights the endothelial surface of thevascular structure.  This histologic finding is not diagnostic of renalvein involvement.  Additional sections prepared from the frozen sectionblock (A1FS) demonstrate a minute amount of adipose tissue adjacent tothe vascular structure consistent with renal sinus adipose tissue.  Thetumor does not invade this adipose tissue or the perinephric adiposetissue.
GROSS DESCRIPTION
(A)  RIGHT LOWER POLE TUMOR, INK AT MARGIN - A partial nephrectomyspecimen (7.7 x 5.3 x 4.2 cm) including a portion of kidney andsurrounding adipose.  At the margin of resection is a protruding area oforange-yellow tumor (0.7 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm) marked with blue surgical ink.This area is re-inked blue.  The remaining resection margin is tan-gray.     A 4.7 x 4.3 x 3.6 cm orange-yellow, partially cystic andhemorrhagic tumor is present.  Focally within the tumor are small areasof gray mucoid material.  The tumor is encapsulated by a rim of tanfibrous tissue.  The tumor bulges into the adjacent perinephric adiposewithout gross infiltration.The surrounding uninvolved renal parenchyma is unremarkable.Representative sections of tumor and normal are submitted for tumorbank.  A portion of the tumor is sequestered for potential electronmicroscopy.     INK CODE:  Blue - reinked surgical ink, yellow - surgicalparenchymal margin, and black - Gerota's fascia.
