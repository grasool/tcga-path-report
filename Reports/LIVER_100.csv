SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT
FINAL PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS:
A: Bile duct, distal margin, excision
-Positive, or detached fragments of hepatocellular carcinoma
B: Bile duct, distal margin #2, excision
-Negative for carcinoma.
C: Bone, xiphoid, excision
-Bone with trilineage hematopolesis.
-Unremarkable cartilage and adipose tissue.
-Negative for carcinoma.
1D:Gallbladder , cholecystectomy
-Gallbladder with chronic cholecystitis and focal intestinal metaplasia.-iVegative, f or carcinoma.
E: Liver, right hepatic lobe, partial hepatectorny
-hlepatocellular carcinoma, poorly differentiated.
Page I of 5 -Margins negativ e for carcinoma (see Comment).
-Background liver with incomplete cirrhosis (stage 5 out of b) and
hemosiderosis (patchy positive 2+14 staining in fiepatocytes and 3+14
staining in Kupffer cells).
-Pathologic Stage : pT2 NX (see Comment and Synoptic Report).
F: Vein, portal bifurc ation ,excision
-Unremarkable vein and soft tissue.
-Negative for carcinoma.
COMMENT: The tumor consists of a poorly differentiated carcinoma composed of malignant
cells with course or vesicular chromatin, occasional prominent nucleoli, and a moderate amount
of amphiphilic cytoplasm arranged in dense sheets or pseudoglandular structures with associated.
prominent interspersed inflammation. There are scattered multinucleated cells. In part F.
inununohistoehemieal stains were performed. (block El0) and demonstrate that the tumor is
strongly positive for glypican 3, and negative for CK7, CK20, and hepatocyte specific antigen
(Hep-earl ). The histomorphotogy and immunohistochemical profile is consistent with a poorly
differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma. The previous outside biopsy Fwas
reviewed in conjunction with the current case and the tumors are histologically similar. The
tumor closely approachcs (less than 0.1 cm), but does not involve, the parenchymal margin of
action. This case was intradcpartmentally reviewed on

diagnosis. Grass Description
A. The specimen is received fresh. labeled '"" segment 5 resection"". The specimen consists of
604.0 gram segmentectomy resection of liver which measures 1x6.0 x 11.0 x 7.0 cm. The capsule of
the specimen is pink-tan to red-brown, focally hemorrhagic, and has bosselated surface. The
parench^,anal resection margin is tan-red-brown, focally cauterized and is inked blue. The specimen is
serially sectioned to reveal an irregular, ill-defined lobulated intraparenehymal tumor mass which
measures 11.0 x 9.0 x 7.0 cm. The tumor is bulging capsule and is 1.0 cm from the closest
parenchymal resection margin- T G tumor mass is focally hemorrhagic and necrotic... The areas of
necrosis range from 0.1 to -2_5 cm in greatest dimension, and occupy less than 10% of the tumor.
Representative section of the tumor in relation to the closest parenchymal resection margin is
submitted for frozen section as FSAI. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted to the
Tissue Procurement Laboratory- Additional sections of the specimen are submitted in 6 cassettes as
follows:

Dl"," Site: Personally, I would interpret the description ""Tunica"" to be referring to the site as the ""serosa"" or ""peritoneum,"" but it is not explicitly stated in the text. The term ""Tunica"" is often used in anatomical context to refer to a membranous cover or sheath, such as the serous membrane that surrounds the liver. However, without further clarification, I cannot be certain.

Laterality: Not provided

Histology: The specimen consists of a ""stony"" ovoid mass with granular brown tissue and an irregular border, which suggests a diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or another type of malignant liver tumor. However, the specific histological diagnosis is not provided in the text.

Stage: The size and weight of the specimen suggest that it may be a relatively advanced-stage tumor, but the staging information is not explicitly stated in the text.

Grade: Not provided

Behavior: Based on the description of the tumor as ""stony"" and irregularly bordered, I would classify its behavior as malignant. However, this classification is not explicitly stated in the text.

Justification: The choice of site, histology, stage, grade, and behavior is based on a careful reading of the provided text and an interpretation of the available information. While some details are missing or unclear, I have made my best judgment based on the evidence presented.",,,,

Laterality: Not provided in the given text.

Histology: The specimen shows adenocarcinoma, which is suggested by the presence of glands and tumor cells infiltrating the bile duct wall.

Stage: Not provided in the given text, but the description of the tumor size (3.5 cm) and its invasion into the liver parenchyma may suggest a more advanced stage.

Grade: The grade of the tumor is not explicitly mentioned, but the presence of necrosis and infiltration into the surrounding tissue suggests a higher grade.

e Reviewed:"," Site: The primary tumor is located in the liver.

Laterality: The laterality is not explicitly mentioned in the description, so it cannot be determined.

Histology: The tumor is a malignant neoplasm, with features suggestive of hepatocellular carcinoma based on the presence of necrotic and hemorrhagic areas, as well as the appearance of cancerous cells in the resected margin.

Stage: The stage is not provided, but the description suggests an advanced-stage tumor due to its large size and involvement of the hepatic vein.

Grade: The grade is not explicitly mentioned, but the presence of necrotic areas may indicate a high-grade malignancy.

Behavior: The behavior of this tumor is malignant, as it exhibits features consistent with cancerous growth and invasion into surrounding tissues.

Justification: The diagnosis is based on the description of gross and microscopic findings, including the presence of necrotic areas, hemorrhage, and infiltration of cancer cells into surrounding tissues.",,,,

measures 10 x 9 x 9 cm; the gallbladder measures 8 x 2.5 x 2_5 cm.. The surgical resection margin of
the liver is inked blue- The external surface of the liver is mostly smooth, but with focal nodular area-
On sectioning, there is a tumor measuring 8 x 8.5 x, 0.5 cm. The tumor is well circumscribed. The cut
surface of the tumor is gray to pink with multilobulated appearance. Necrosis and hemorrhage are
present. In the center of the tumor there is a. stellate scar .The tumor is 0_7 cm from the closest
parenchymal surgical resection margin- It is subcapsular, and comes within 0.1 cm from the overlying
capsule. The serosal surface of the gallbladder is smooth and glistening... The cystic. wall measures
0.1 cm in thickness. The mucosal surface is velvety and bile-tinged. There ismedium amount of bile,
and no calculi are identified. One section is submitted for Tissue Procurement Laboratory.

The carcinoma is mostly invaded around the common bile duct and involves the bile ductal
mucosa. Based on the microscopic findings, this tumor is considered biliary primary,
although panlN is present.
The incidental neuroendocrine tumor is confirmed by its strong immunopositivity for
synaptophysin and chromogranin, while the surrounding adenocarcinoma is negative.

(variable, strong to moderate), HepParl (focal, weak), CD10 (focal, canalicular pattern),
and pCEA (focal, canalicular pattern).
*CLINICAL HISTORY:
Hepatitis B infection.
*COMMENT (S)
The tumor shows morphologic features of combined cholangiocarcinoma and hepatocellular
carcinoma, in roughly equal proportions.Although immunophenotype is predominantly of
cholangiocellular type, cytokeratin staining is weaker in areas of morphologic HCC, and
focal CD10/pCEA staining is present in these areas.in addition, many bile duct
hamartomas/von Meyenburg complexes (VMCs) are seen in non-neoplastic liver, as well as in
direct continuity with neoplasm (no definite in situ/dysplastic transformation of VMCS is
appreciated, however).Multiple VMCs is considered by many authors to represent a mild
form of ductal plate malformation (DPM). Likewise, there is a documented though rare
association of DPM/VMCs with cholangiocarcinoma.The significance of this finding, with
regards to potential causality for (or contribution to) neoplasia, is unclear in the
pathology literature.With regards to vascular invasion, scattered foci of tumor present
in medium-sized portal/septal type veins are identified. "" Major""venous invasion, per
AJCC/CAP definition, cannot be assessed in this specimen.

Microscopic Examination Unknown.
Special stains are performed on block A3. The reticulin stain confirms loss
of reticulin meshwork in the hepatocellular carcinoma. The tumor displays
focal pseudoglandular growth pattern. The mucicarmine stain is negative.
In the background uninvolved liver, the trichrome and the reticulin special
stains confirm the established cirrhosis. The portal tracts and the fibrous
septa. contain mild to moderate mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate. There is
mild bile ductular proliferation, but the native bile ducts are intact. The
parenchyma within regenerative nodules exhibits occasional ballooned
hepatocytes with poorly-formed Mallory bodies. Patchy pericellular sinusoidal
fibrosis is present within the regenerative nodules. The copper stain
highlights mild copper deposit in periportal/periseptal hepatocytes. The PASD
stain reveals PAS positive, diastase resistant, granules in
peri.portal/periseptal hepatocytes. The iron stain is negative.

COMMENT :The uninvolved liv er shows established cirrhosis .The presence of
steatosis ,occasional ballooned hepatocytes ,and patchy pericellular
sinusoidal fibrosis suggests steatohepatitis. The result of PASD and copper
stainsare not specific, however, the possibility of Wilson' s disease and
alpha--l--antitrypsin deficiency needs to be clinically excluded.

LIGHT MICROSCOPY
Light microscopic examination is performed.
Sections reveal that both of the grossly identified masses are moderately differentiatedhepatocellular {carcinoma. j'he tumor cells have a cord-like distribution and display moderate nuclear atypia. The tumor
closely approaches the hepatic capsule, but does not invade through it. Apparent lymphovascular space
invasion is present within the liver in the area of the gallbladder bed. The surrounding, non-neoplastic
liver shows some bile stasis, which is predominantly intrahepatocellular. There is mild bile duct
proliferation and scattered neutrophilic aggregates within portal areas and sinusoids. These findings are
suggestive of a biliary obstruction, possibly secondary to the tumor. Also present are mild portal
lymphocytic infiltrates, consistent with a mild (Grade 1) chronic hepatitis. Viral cytopathic
effect is not noted. An iron stain shows no evidence of iron accumulation within the liver. There is no
evidence of fibrosis or cirrhosis. Small foci of macrovesicular steatosis are noted. DIAGNOSIS

LIGHT MICROSCOPY
Light microscopic examination is performed.
Sections show a well circumscribed and apparently encapsulated tumor nodule composed of enlarged
hyperchromatic hepatocytes arranged predominantly in a trabecular pattern. There is both a micro-
trabecular as well as a macro-trabecular pattern. Focal pseudo-acinar structures are also
seen. There are focal areas of tumor necrosis and hemorrhage. Focal changes suspicious for
lymphovascular space invasion are observed in the capsule(section #8). There was a single nodule of
tumor without any apparent satellite lesions. The tumor appears to be well differentiated and does not
involve in the surgical margins. The adjacent liver tissue has a normal hepatitic architecture without
significant fibrosis. Steatosis was also absent.

Comment:
The mesothelial proliferation noted in specimen F is markedly reactive in cytologic appearance. It displays
a positive reaction to calretin, indicating its mesothelial origin. Dr. has reviewed the slides of the portions
of lung removed and concurs with the diagnostic opinion.
The portion of gallbladder removed for frozen section (FSA1) represents a gallbladder duplication cyst.

Gross Description:
Received are seven appropriately labeled containers.
Container A is additionally labeled ""gallbladder mass for frozen"". Per the frozen section team the specimen
consisted of an 11 x 4 x 2.5 cm gallbladder, not previously opened, containing no stones with a pink serosal
surface. The cauterized hepatic surface is inked black. A 1.7 cm, well-circumscribed, white nodule is noted
at the gallbladder fundus, a portion of which is sampled in FSAI. The remainder of the gallbladder mucosa
is generally green/tan and velvety with occasional flecks of yellow noted on the surface. No lymph nodes
are identified. Additional sections of the fundic nodule are submitted in Al-A2 while sections of the
gallbladder mucosa at the fundus, neck and cystic duct are submitted in A3.
Container B: Per the frozen section team the specimen consisted of a 2.0 cm lymph node which is bisected.
Half of the specimen is submitted in FSA1 and the remainder in Al.
Container C is additionally labeled ""right lobectomy liver"". The specimen consists of a 1050 g, 15 x 15 x
15 cm partial hepatectomy specimen, portions of which have been sampled for frozen section and given to
Tissue Procurement. The margin of resection has been inked in black. The hepatic surface is generally
smooth and glistening with a 10.5 x 6.0 cm portion of adherent diaphragm and parietal pleura. Serial
sectioning reveals a 12 x 10 x 10 cm, fairly well-circumscribed, yellow/tan mass with large areas and
necrosis and hemorrhage noted. The mass has a vaguely nodular character along with occasional fibrous
septations noted. The mass appears to come within 0.3 cm from the inked surgical margin. The mass
appears to abut the capsule does not erode through it. The remaining hepatic parenchyma is red/brown,
smooth without fibrosis or nodularity noted. Representative sections are submitted as per the block
summary.

Container D is additionally labeled ""right portal lymph node"". It holds a 2.5 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm, roughly ovoid
lymph node with a tan homogenous cut surface. Bisected. D1 and D2
Container E is additionally labeled ""superior segment right lower lobe"". Within container E is a 3.5 x 1.5 x
1.0 cm, roughly triangular portion of gray/purple soft tissue with a stapled edge. Two fairly well
circumscribed, variegated, white/red nodules are noted in the lung parenchyma measuring 0.4 and 0.3 cm in
greatest dimension. The specimen is serially sectioned and entirely submitted.
E1 - portion of lung closest to stapled margin
E2,E3 - remaining specimen
Container F is additionally labeled ""face of right lower lobe"". Within container F is a 4.5 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm
irregular portion of purple/gray apparent lung with a 2 cm stapled edge and a 3.5 cm open edge. The pleural
surface is studded by multiple pale tan nodules measuring 0.6 cm in greatest dimension. The specimen is
entirely submitted in F1-F5 with the section closest to the stapled margin in F1.
Container G is additionally labeled ""left portal lymph node"". It holds a 2 x 1 x 0.8 cm, single, irregularly-
shaped, black/tan soft tissue fragment. G 1
Light Microscopy:
Light microscopic examination is performed.
Sections of the gallbladder show chronic cholecystitis with cholesterolosis. The cystic structure noted adjacent to gallbladder lumen and examined by frozen section is grossly unconnected to the lumen of the
gallbladder and unlike the gallbladder mucosa is not stained with bile. It consists of a round cystic structure
lined by columnar epithelium and completely surrounded by a thick smooth muscle wall. The
lining mucosa in multiple foci concentrically around the lumen penetrates the wall in a Rokatansky-
Aschoff-like pattern.. These features are consistent with a gallbladder duplication cyst. Sections of the liver
tumor show a tii atel^idifterentlated epatocellular carcinoma with large numbers of PAS-positive
alpha-l- antitrypsin inclusions. Trichrome and reticulin stains demonstrate biliary fibrosis
in the adjacent parenchyma. The iron stain is non-contributory. Tumor infiltrates the inferior surface of the
diaphragm with some destruction and fibrosis of skeletal muscle of the diaphragm. However, the
diaphragm is not penetrated by tumor.
The right lower lobe of the lung, on the immediately adjacent diaphormatic surface shows striking
mesothelial proliferation, but no tumor is identified.
The three lymph nodes submitted show reactive hyperplasia but no evidence for metastatic hepatocellular
carcinoma.

Gross Description:
Specimen A is received fresh for frozen section and is a 10 x 4 x 3 cm red/tan soft tissue fragment which
was frozen as FSAI
Specimen B is received in a formalin-filled container labeled ""liver segments 5, 8, stitch = do not mark margin upper section"" and is a 740 gram, 15.5 x 14.8 x 10.5 cm partial hepatectomy specimen. There is one
roughened cauterized surface ,which is the surgical resection surface .This surface is entirely
inked blue. At the periphery, there is a 9.3 x 4.0 cm area of exposed golden brown liver parenchyma. There
is a portion of the liver tacked down to this surface with suture materia. There is additionally suture
material in the center of this exposed parenchyma. This is believed to be the surface referenced on the
specimen container as ""do not mark margin upper section"".
L1The capsular surface is red/tan, subtly mottled with hemorrhage and remarkable for a 10 x 7.5 cm area of
subcapsular firmness .This does not appear to be a contiguous mass. Sectioning exhibits golden brown liver
parenchyma .The liver parenchyma is remarkable for at least three intraparenchymal lesions, 8 x 5 x 3
mm, 1.5 x 0.8 x 0.8 cm, and approximately 11 x 7 x 6.5 cm. These intraparenchymal lesions are each firm,
white and have well -defined to scalloped borders. The largest lesion has some areas of erythema and
hemorrhage scattered throughout. The largest lesion causes the capsular disruption noted previously.
The largest lesion has a lobulated shape and is believed to cause all of the capsular distortions . The two
smaller lesions are well within the parenchyma and not near the capsule .The smallest lesion is 4.3 cm to
the closest blue inked margin, the mid sized lesion is 4.8 cm to the closest blue inked margin and the largest
lesion is 2.1 cm to the closest blue inked margin. There are no other abnormalities readily identified within
the liver parenchyma. There is a wire mesh stent present within some of the vasculature of the liver.
Sections are submitted per the block summary.

Grade: The grade of the tumor is not provided, but some features suggestive of higher-grade disease include trabecular architecture, plate expansion, nuclear pleomorphism, and variable nucleolar prominence.
Behavior: Malignant (hepatocellular carcinoma is a type of primary liver cancer)

The justification for these choices includes the description of a large mass in the liver with features consistent with hepatocellular carcinoma, such as a white/yellow appearance, diffuse hemorrhage, and a central fibrous component. The tumor is confined by the capsular surface but abuts it closely, and there are satellite lesions located some distance from the main mass. These features suggest that the tumor is malignant and locally advanced, although the stage cannot be determined without additional information.

focal areas of cauterization and inked black. Sectioning reveals
brown unremarkable liver parenchyma. The specimen is entirely
submitted in block El-E6,
Light Microscopy:
Light microscopic examination is performed by Dr.
The sections show hepatocellular carcinoma involving the portal
tract margin (Bl), the surgical margin in specimen B and also
the separately submitted medial (specimen D) and anterior
margins (specimen E). The carcinoma is detached in specimen D
and uninked; therefore, the carcinoma in this specimen cannot be
oriented as to old versus new margin in specimen D. In specimen
E.the carcinoma involves both the old and the new margin.
Stains are performed on the portal tract margin (B1) and the
carcinoma in this section is positive for glypican 3 and shows
widened trabeculae by reticulin staining. The
immunohistochemistry is supportive of portal tract margin
involvement in Specimen B.
The hepatocellular carcinoma abuts capsule with an overlying
fibrous serosal adhesion, reactive mesothelial cells and
hemosiderin laden macrophages. Immunohistochemistry is performed
on the section with capsule (B4). HEPAR-l is negative within the
fibrous adhesion and calretinin highlights reactive mesothelial
cells. The carcinoma abuts capsule; but no diagnostic
involvement of capsule is identified. The hepatocellular carcinoma shows both trabecular and
pseudoglandular (acinar) architecture. Immunohistochemistry is
performed on a representative section of carcinoma (B5). HEPAR-1
stains a subset including the gland forming areas.
Glypican 3 is positive. CK7 is positive in a subset including
both the glandular and non-glandular architecture. CD5 is
negative. The findings are consistent with a hepatocellular
carcinoma with areas of pseudoglandular architecture. No
adenocarcinoma (cholangiocarcinoma or metastatic colorectal
carcinoma) is identified.
The background liver is cirrhotic with mild steatosis (< 10%,
predominately macrovesicular). No definite active
steatohepatitis is identified. Special stains are performed on
the representative uninvolved liver (B8). Reticulin and
trichrome highlight stage 4 fibrosis. Iron highlights scattered
iron within hepatocytes and mostly within Kupffer cells. PASD
stains macrophages in sinusoidal areas,and is negative for
alpha-1 antitrypsin particles.
In the cecal margin block of specimen A (A2) there is apparent
detached benign appearing liver tissue. HEPAR-1 is positive in
these detached fragments confirming liver in this section. This
may represent floater versus adhesion to liver. No carcinoma is
identified in the proximal cecal margin.

Comment:
Immunostains are performed on a section of tumor (block A5). The
malignant cells are positive for cytokeratin AE1/AE3, CK8/18,
and HepParl. MOC-31 shows patchy moderate staining. CD10 is
negative. The immunophenotype shows overlapping features between
hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma; however, given
the strong HepParl staining, a poorly differentiated
hepatocellular carcinoma is favored.
Special stains are performed on a section of background liver
(block A9). A trichrome stain shows bridging fibrosis with areas
suggestive of possible early nodule formation. There is a single
focus of minor centrilobular perisinusoidal fibrosis. A
reticulin stain shows no significant hepatic plate expansion. An
iron stain shows mild to moderately increased iron staining
within hepatocytes (grade 2 of 4) and increased iron staining
within Kupffer cells. A PAS-D stain shows no PAS positive
cytoplasmic inclusions.

Comment:
A reticulin stain confirms the presence of hepatocellular
carcinoma.
Background liver shows macrovesicular steatosis involving
approximately 30-40% of the hepatic parenchyma. Ballooned
hepatocytes containing Mallory' s hyaline are readily
identified, and moderate numbers of inflammatory cells, mainly
neutrophils, are clustered around and within lobular
hepatocytes. A trichrome stain shows patchy pericellular and
periportal fibrosis. The findings are consistent with
steatohepatitis. The presence of Mallory' s hyaline and
neutrophil-predominant lobular inflammation raises suspicion for
alcoholic steatohepatitis. Clinical correlation is recommended.

No piecemeal necrosis is identified. There is mixed macrovesicular
and microvesicular steatosis involving less than 5% of the hepatic
parenchyma and no features are present to suggest involvement by
steatohepatitis.
A trichrome stain highlights areas of periportal fibrosis with no
evidence of bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis. A reticulin stain also
highlights periportal fibrosis but shows an otherwise normal hepatic
plate thickness. A DPAS stain shows no evidence of alpha-l-
antitrypsin deficiency (no DPAS positive globules identified within
hepatocytes). An iron stain shows a mild increase in hepatic
iron (grade 1 of 4). The findings are consistent with chronic
hepatitis, grade 1, stage 2. The differential diagnosis includes
viral hepatitis and autoimmune hepatitis. Correlation with clinical
history and laboratory studies is recommended to determine the
etiology of the chronic hepatitis.
Clinical History:
The patient is a -year-old female with a clinical diagnosis of
HCC. Gross Description:
Specimen A is received with one appropriately labeled container
additionally labeled ""gallbladder"".
Previously opened or disrupted: No
Measurements: 4.6 x 3.1 x 0.9 cm
External surface: Yellow/green, smooth and glistening
Luminal contents: Green viscous fluid
Stones present: No
Mucosa: Green and velvety
Wall thickness: 1 mm
Other comments: No
Block #: Al - Cystic duct margin and representative section
Tissue remains in formalin.
Specimen B is received in formalin appropriately labeled ""segments 5
and 6"".
Specimen Type: Segmentectomy and right hemicolectomy
Specimen Weight: 745 grams
Measurement: 12.5 x 11 x 7 cm segment of liver with attached right
hemicolectomy consisting of 3 cm of terminal ileum and 14 cm of
cecum and ascending colon.
Orientation: Anatomical. The liver resection margin is inked blue.
Capsule: There is a 14.5 cm yellow bulging defect with adherent
mesenteric fat and colon. Where the tumor is adherent to the
mesentery, the surface margin is inked green. The remainder of the
capsule is tan/brown and smooth. Beneath the capsular defect there
is an 11 x 9 x 6.5 cm white to tan nodular partially
circumscribed mass with multiple adjacent budding nodules.
Mass:Further sectioning reveals a blood vessel that is plugged
with tumor thrombus. Additionally, the mass extends through the
capsule to within 1.1 cm of the green inked mesenteric margin. Where
the mass is adherent to the bowel, it appears to extend to but not
grossly invade the capsule. The tumor is 1.7 cm from the blue inked
hepatic resection margin, and widely free of the distal margin.
Adjacent liver tissue: Tan/brown and unremarkable.
The colonic mucosa is pink/tan with normal folding.
The appendix is surgically absent.
Major portal vein/ hepatic vein:
Gallbladder: See specimen A.

B11 - Tumor in relationship to the bowel
B12 - Tumor in relationship to lateral sidewall muscle
B13 - Vascular margin with thrombus, en face
B14-B15 - Multiple colonic lymph nodes
Container C is additionally labeled ""ileum."" It holds a 6 cm in
length x 2.1 cm in diameter segment of small bowel. There is a 2.5 x
1.8 cm area of hemorrhagic adhesions 0.5 cm from the closest mucosal
margin. The serosal surface is pink/tan and smooth. Opening reveals
pink/tan mucosa with normal folding. Beneath the hemorrhagic
adhesions, the cut surface is yellow fat.

A. Lose of heterozygosity is IDENTIFIED at chromosomeSq (371).B. Fractional Allelic Lose is 8%(1 locus with lo8e /12 informative loci). Block48, microdissectiontarget 2 (T2):
A. Lose of heterozygosity is IDEN'i'T.FIED at chromosome lp (321).B. Fractional Allelic Loss is 8%(1 locus with loss/12 informative loci).
Note;
LON of high amplitudeis considered when more than 75% of cellular DNA is affected.
Loss of heterozygosity of tumor suppressor gene alleles is knownto occur inliver neoplaeias and to correlate with tumor progression. As reported in theliterature, benign neoplasms (hepatic adenoma and focal nodular hyperplasia)typically have low frequency of LOH (mean tractional allelic lose -61) and hepatocellular carcinomas (BCC) frequently have higher prevalence of LOX (meanfractional allele loss -301) (1,2). Some studies have shown that MCC with
PAL of 430% are associated with indolent biological behavior and PAL of >30%with an aggressive biological behavior (3-5). LOU mutations are reported ashigh amplitude when more than 754 of cellular DNA is affected.Some HCC with low amplitude LOX mutations and PAL 25 -35 4 considered to be indeterminatebiological behavior .However,not all tumors reveal such a correlation and,therefore , the LOH profileshould be interpreted in the context of thecytologicand histologic findings and the patient'a clinical history.Sample Preparation and LOH Analysis
Manual microdissection of the tissue sample was performed to include tumor
tissue and normal adjacent tissue if available)or a blood sample. DNA wasisolated using standard laboratory procedure.Specimens with the minimum of
S0% of tumor cells in a microdisseetion target are accepted for the analysis.
Optical density readings were obtained.
Eighteen microsatellite markers (listed below )that have been previously foundto be involved in liver neoplasia and/or co-localize with known tumor
suppressor genes were used for analysis.FCR was performed using
fluorescently labeled primers and the products of amplification were detected
using capillary electrophoresis on A613730 platform .Relative fluorescence was
determined for individual alleles and the ratio of peaks was calculated
. Normal tissue was examined to determine whether the
patient is heterozygous at the marker (genetically informative )and neoplactic
tissue was then analyzed to detect lose of heterozygosity .Thresholds for
significant allelic imbalance were determined using normal(non-neoplastic)
specimens for every marker .Loss of heterozygosity was determined using (NL /Na)! (TL /TS) formula and reported when allelic ratio for a particular marker
was below 0.5 or above 2.0. when normal tissue was not available ,peak height
ratios falling outside of 2 We beyond the mean for each polymorphic allele
iparngwere assessed asshowing lose of heterozygosity.

oat. Reviewed"," Based on the given text, here are the answers for the six categories:

Site: The site of the tumor is not explicitly mentioned in the text, but it can be inferred that it is a liver neoplasia since the markers used for analysis have been previously found to be involved in liver neoplasia.

Laterality: Laterality is also not provided in the text.

Histology: The histology of the tumor is not explicitly stated, but based on the context, it can be assumed that it is either hepatic adenoma or hepatocellular carcinoma since these are the types of liver neoplasia mentioned in the text.

Stage: The stage of the tumor is not provided in the text.

Grade: The grade of the tumor is not explicitly stated, but the text mentions PAL (proliferation index) which can be used to determine the grade of the tumor. However, specific values for PAL are not given.

Behavior: Based on the PAL values mentioned in the text, it can be inferred that the tumor with a PAL of 430% or more has an aggressive biological behavior, and a PAL between 25-35% is considered indeterminate for biological behavior. However, specific information about the tumor's behavior is not provided.

Therefore, the answers are:

Site: Liver neoplasia (inferred)
Laterality: Not provided
Histology: Hepatic adenoma or hepatocellular carcinoma (inferred)
Stage: Not provided
Grade: Not explicitly stated
Behavior: Indeterminate or aggressive (based on PAL values, but not specifically mentioned for this tumor).",,,,

""Site"": The site is not explicitly mentioned in the report, but based on the context, it appears to be a specimen from a surgical procedure, so I'll assume the site is the area where the surgery was performed, which is not provided in this report.
2. ""Laterality"": The report does not mention laterality.
3. ""Histology"": The histological pattern is mosaic and storiform with lymphocytic infiltration, fibrosis, and vascular invasion, suggesting a neoplastic process, but the specific type of neoplasm is not provided in the report.
4. ""Stage"": The report does not contain enough information to determine the stage.
5. ""Grade"": The report does not provide sufficient information to determine the grade.
6. ""Behavior"": Based on the histological findings of lymphocytic infiltration, fibrosis, and vascular invasion, the behavior appears to be neoplastic, but the specific type of neoplasm is not provided in the report.",,,,

Laterality: Laterality is not provided or inferable from the information given in the form.

Histology: The histological diagnosis suggests adenocarcinoma, but more specific information about the type of adenocarcinoma is not provided.

Stage: The TNM stage is not explicitly mentioned; however, there are details about the primary tumor and lymph nodes that could be used to determine the stage.

Grade: The grade of the tumor is not explicitly stated in the form. However, there is some information about nuclear features that might help a pathologist determine the grade.

Behavior: The behavior of this lesion is assumed to be malignant based on the context and the histological diagnosis of adenocarcinoma.

The information provided is not sufficient for a complete pathology report, as important details such as the exact site, laterality, stage, grade, and behavior are missing or unclear.",,,,

*(INTEG)tATEDRE,AORT OF FINDINGS BY"," Site: The specimen is from the breast, as indicated by the focus on primary tumor in the breast and associated lymph nodes.

Laterality: Not provided, as there is no information given about the location of the tumor within the breast.

Histology: Infiltrating ductal carcinoma, as suggested by the diffuse growth pattern, cell distribution, and structural patterns present in the microscopic description.

Stage: pT3 No Mo, indicating a significant primary tumor (>5 cm) without evidence of regional lymph node or distant metastasis.

Grade: Not explicitly stated, but the presence of necrosis, high mitotic activity, and poor cellular differentiation suggest a higher grade lesion.

Behavior: Malignant, given the infiltrating nature of the tumor and the absence of any information suggesting otherwise. The justification for these categories is based on the provided pathology report, with a focus on the microscopic description and the pTNM staging.",,,,

Date"," Based on the data provided, here is the information for the requested categories:

Site: The primary tumor site is not explicitly mentioned in the data, but it can be inferred that it may be related to the breast based on the mention of ""Hormone Replacement Therapy"" and various breast cancer-related tests such as ""CEA,"" ""CA 15-3,"" ""CA 19-9,"" and ""PSA."" However, this is not definitive.

Laterality: Not provided.

Histology: The histological diagnosis is not explicitly stated in the data, but there are several clues that suggest a malignant epithelial tumor, such as the mention of ""Hormone Replacement Therapy,"" various breast cancer-related tests, and pathological findings like ""Diffuse Necrosis"" and ""Vascular Invasion."" However, this is not definitive.

Stage: The stage is not explicitly mentioned in the data, but there are several clues that suggest a later stage based on the mention of various imaging studies such as ""Ultrasound X,"" ""X-Ray,"" ""CT,"" and ""MRI,"" as well as the mention of ""Surgical Treatment"" and ""Neoadjuvant Therapy."" However, this is not definitive.

Grade: The grade is not explicitly mentioned in the data.

Behavior: Based on the various clues, it can be inferred that the tumor behavior is malignant. However, this is not definitive.

Justification: The justification for these categories is based on the available data and the various clues that suggest a malignant epithelial tumor, likely related to the breast, at a later stage, with a high grade and malignant behavior. However, it's important to note that this interpretation may not be accurate without further information.",,,,

Laterality: Not provided.

Histology: The histological diagnosis is adenocarcinoma based on the mention of ""Glandular cell"" and ""Cellular Differentiation: Glandular.""

Stage: The stage appears to be T3 N1 M0, based on the given information.

Grade: The nuclear grade is not explicitly mentioned, but hyperchromatism, nucleolar prominence, multinucleated giant cells, and mitotic activity suggest a high-grade tumor.

1. Site: The primary tumor location is not explicitly mentioned in the given report; however, it can be inferred to be in the pancreas based on the surgical procedure and other diagnostic studies.
2. Laterality: Not provided in the report.
3. Histology: The histological diagnosis is adenocarcinoma, as stated in the ""Histological Diagnosis"" section of the report.
4. Stage: The pathological stage is pT3 No M0, which indicates that the tumor has grown into the surrounding tissues but has not spread to distant sites or lymph nodes.
5. Grade: The grade of the tumor is not explicitly mentioned in the report; however, it can be inferred to be moderately differentiated based on the description ""moderately well-differentiated adenocarcinoma"" found in the IRS Approval section.
6. Behavior: The behavior of this tumor is malignant, as it is an invasive cancer that can spread to other parts of the body.

Justification: These six categories are chosen because they provide essential information about the tumor's characteristics and help guide treatment decisions.

14"," Based on the given replacement therapy social history and lab data, here are the six categories with my choices and justifications:

1. Site: Lung, as the smoking history and positive AFP test result suggest a possible primary lung tumor. However, it is not explicitly stated in the document.
2. Laterality: Not provided, as there is no information about the location or side of the tumor.
3. Histology: Adenocarcinoma, as the positive AFP test result suggests a hepatocellular carcinoma, which is a type of adenocarcinoma. However, it is not explicitly stated in the document.
4. Stage: Not provided, as there is no information about the size or extent of the tumor.
5. Grade: Not provided, as there is no information about the differentiation or aggressiveness of the tumor.
6. Behavior: Malignant, as the positive AFP test result and the need for replacement therapy suggest a malignant tumor. However, it is not explicitly stated in the document.

In summary, based on the available information, I chose ""Site"" as lung, but it's not explicitly mentioned; ""Laterality"" is not provided; ""Histology"" as adenocarcinoma, but it's not confirmed; ""Stage"" and ""Grade"" are not provided, and ""Behavior"" as malignant.",,,,

Site: Not explicitly provided, but can be inferred to be the prostate based on the mentioned tests and treatments.

Laterality: Not provided, as no information about the spread of the cancer suggests it is limited to one side of the prostate.

Histology: Adenocarcinoma, not otherwise specified (NOS), as this is a common type of prostate cancer.

Stage: T3 N0 M0, meaning the tumor has grown beyond the prostate but has not yet spread to nearby lymph nodes or distant sites.

Grade: Not explicitly provided, but it can be inferred that the grade is likely higher than 1 due to the need for treatment.

Behavior: Malignant, as this is a cancer diagnosis.

Justification: The given information includes tests and treatments specific to prostate cancer, such as PSA levels, biopsy results, and surgical procedures on the prostate gland.",,,,

2. ""Laterality"": Not provided, as the information is not relevant for rectal tumors which are typically located in the lower part of the body.
3. ""Histology"": The histological type of the tumor is adenocarcinoma - this is stated in the 'Pathological Description' section where it mentions ""SOUNWH ON GbndularadN*MCdSaaftetlon"".
4. ""Stage"": Based on the surgical treatment and pathological staging sections, the tumor appears to be at least pT3 N1 M0 stage (invasive tumor with metastasis in 1 to 3 pericolic or perirectal lymph nodes but no distant metastasis).
5. ""Grade"": Not provided, as the report does not include information about the differentiation level of the cancer cells.
6. ""Behavior"": Malignant - this is inherent in the definition of adenocarcinoma and supported by phrases like ""invasion"" used in the pathological description.",,,,

Reviewer Initi s __.Aa eviewed: -J"," Based on the incomplete medical history provided, here is the summary of the case:

1. Site: Not provided
2. Laterality: Not provided
3. Histology: The patient has a positive HepC test result, indicating liver disease, but the specific histological diagnosis is not provided.
4. Stage: The clinical staging is T2N0M0, which means that the primary tumor is 5 cm or less in size and has not spread to nearby lymph nodes or distant organs. However, the detailed location, size, and type of the tumor are not provided.
5. Grade: The grade of the tumor is not provided, making it difficult to assess its aggressiveness and potential for metastasis.
6. Behavior: Not provided

Justification: The site and laterality of the tumor are crucial for determining the appropriate treatment plan and prognosis. Histology provides information about the type and characteristics of the tumor, which is essential for selecting the most effective therapy. Stage, grade, and behavior are also important factors that influence the patient's outcome and response to treatment. Therefore, it is necessary to have complete and accurate information in these six categories to make informed clinical decisions.",,,,

Prior Malignancy History
Dual/Synckropous Primary"," Based on the given medical report, here are the relevant categories with some information or ""not provided"" when missing:

1. Site: The primary tumor site is not explicitly mentioned but suspected involved lymph nodes and other details suggest a possible gastrointestinal location.
2. Laterality: Not provided, as the report does not specify whether the tumor affected one side or was bilateral.
3. Histology: Adenocarcinoma, based on the mention of CEA, CA 19-9, and other tumor markers.
4. Stage: The TNM staging suggests a locally advanced cancer (T3 N0 M0), but the final pathological stage is not provided.
5. Grade: Not provided, as the report does not include information about the differentiation or growth rate of the cancer cells.
6. Behavior: Malignant, as it is a cancer diagnosis with potential for invasion and metastasis.

Justification: The choice of these categories is based on the available information in the medical report, which includes various tests, imaging results, and treatment recommendations suggestive of a gastrointestinal adenocarcinoma. However, some key details such as laterality, stage, and grade are not explicitly stated, making it challenging to provide definitive answers for those categories.",,,,

Liver (460 grams, 17.5 x 7.9 x 3.8 cm) gallbladder (7.2 x 3.5 x 3.1
cm), omentum biopsy (2 pieces 2.6 x 0 .8 x 0.5 cm) and hepatic artery
lymph node.
DIAGNOSIS:
Liver and gallbladder, resection: Grade 3_of 4, hepatocellular
carcinoma, usual type, forming a hilarmass4.8 x 4.3 x 3.2 cm
involving segments V and VIII abutting the gallbladder, but no
involving it. The hepatic capsule is free of tumor. The surgical
margins are free of tumor, the clearance being 0.7 cm
microscopically. Angiolymphatic invasion is identified (by VVG
stain) within the tumor however, extratumoral vascular invasion is
not identified. The tumor is partially encapsulated, infiltration
of parenchyma being of the pushing type. The adjacent liver
parenchyma is non-cirrhotic. The gallbladder shows subacute and
chronic cholecystitis with cholelithiasis (3 mixed stones). All
surgical margins are free of tumor, closest 0.7 cm.
Imniunoperoxidase studies were performed on paraffin sections of the
liver mass using antibodies directed against the following antigens:
Hep-1, pCEA, keratin, TTF-1, CD10, mucicarmine, albumin ISH, and
VVG.The tumor cells are positive for albumin RNA by ISH with
patchy strong staining for keratin, Hep-1 with focal focal
canalicular pCEA positivity, and patchy cytoplasmic TTF-1
positivity. The tumor cells are negative for CD10 and mucicarmine.
These findings support the H.E diagnosis.
Omentum, biopsy: Fat necrosis negative for malignancy.
Lymphnode,hepatic artery ,excision :A single hepatic artery lymph
node is negative for tumor.
