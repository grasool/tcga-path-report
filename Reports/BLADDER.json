The first two\ncontainers are received without formalin for frozen section. The\nremaining three containers are received with formalin.\nThe first is labeled \"A, left distal ureter FS\" and contains a full thickness\ncross section of apparent ureter measuring 0.4 cm in diameter and 0.3 cm in\nlength with a small amount of associated fat. The specimen is submitted in toto\nfor frozen section diagnosis with the residue now resubmitted for permanent\nsection in cassette Al.\nThe second container is labeled \"B, right distal ureter\" and contains a short\nsegment of apparent ureter measuring 1.2 cm in length with an average diameter\nof 0.6 cm .One aspect is tagged with a suture. A representative section is\nsubmitted for frozen section diagnosis with the residue now resubmitted for\npermanent section in cassette Bl. The remaining tissue is now serially\nsectioned and submitted entirely in cassette B2.\nThe third container is labeled \"anterior exenteration \"and contains an anterior\nexenteration specimen including the urinary bladder, which measures 5.5 x 4.5 x\n3.2 cm, the uterus which measures 7.2 x 4.5 x 3.0 cm and an excision of vaginal\ncuff surrounding the cervix measuring 5.2 x 3 .8 cm in area. The soft tissue\nsurfaces overlying the bladder are inked black. The irregular resection margins\nsurrounding the vaginal cuff are inked blue. The specimen is opened\nlongitudinally revealing a papillary tumor involving the approximate midline\ntrigone area of the bladder mucosa, measuring 1.4 x 0.9 x 0.8 cm. Adjacent to\nthe right of the tumor is an area of previous fulguration measuring 2.0 x 1.9 cm\nin area .Combined ,these two areas measure 2.9 cm in greatest dimension.\nSectioning of this area reveals gross invasion to a depth of 1.0 cm at a\ndistance of 0.2 cm from the inked posterior soft tissue surface. The mass does\nnot grossly appear to invade the uterine cervix or other structures.

The third container is additionally identified as, \"bladder, vas deferens\".\nReceived fresh and placed in formalin is a 301.8 g, 16 x 10.5 x 3.6 cm\ncystoprostatectomy specimen with attached mesenteric fat. The bladder measures\n7.5 x 7 x 2.5 cm. The right ureteral stump measures 5 x 0.3 cm and the left 3 x\n0.5 cm, and both demonstrate patent lumina. The prostate measures 4.2 x 3 x 2.9\ncm. The right seminal vesicle measures 2.8 x 1.1 x 0.6 cm and the right vas\ndeferens 8 x 0.5 cm. Detached vessels are also present measuring 5.2 and 5.5 cm\nin length by 0.3 cm in diameter The left seminal vesicle measures 2.4 x 1 x 0.5\ncm and the left vas deferens 12 x 0.5 cm. Plastic tubing is present in the\nbladder. There is disruption of the junction of the prostate and bladder along\nthe right side of the specimen. The urethral stump is flush with the prostate\napex. The right half of the prostate and bladder is inked blue and the left half\nis inked black. The prostate is opened anteriorly along the urethra and\ncontinued superiorly through the bladder in a Y-shaped incision. The prostate is\nserially sectioned from apex to base to reveal an ill-defined, yellow-tan, firm\nlesion measuring 1.8 x 0.9 x 0.6 cm in the right prostate measuring 0.1 cm from\nthe margin. The bladder demonstrates a tan, fungating, ulcerated 5.5 x 5.5 cm\nmass involving the dome, right lateral wall, right half of the anterior wall and\nsome of the right posterior wall. The right ureteral orifice is involved by the\nmass. Serial sectioning reveals ill-defined tumor invasion into the adipose\ntissue to a depth of 1.4 cm, extending to 0.2 cm of the inked margin. The\nremainder of the mucosa is tan-brown, edematous, and glistening with a uniform\n0.2 cm wall thickness. The bilateral ureteral orifices are identified and probe\npatent.

The specimen is totally submitted for frozen\nsection as Cl.\nD. Received fresh at the frozen desk is a specimen labeled \"final urethral margin\" consisting of one\npiece of unoriented tissue measuring 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm. The specimen is totally submitted for frozen\nsection in D1.\nE. Received in formalin previously opened and inked with the margins taken is a specimen which\nconsists of a urinary bladder, bilateral ureters, prostate and attached seminal vesicles and vas deferens.\nThe bladder measures 13.0 x 9.0 x 5.5 cm. The external surface of the bladder is covered by a serosal\nlining at the dome and fibroadipose tissue at the remaining portion. After the bladder is opened an\nirregular, tan-white, firm area is identified measuring 3.5 x 3.0 cm. The mass appears to encompass the\nentire trigone, the anterior, posterior, left bladder walls and both ureteral orifices. The mass is semisolid\nwith tan-brown to white, friable possible papillary areas. On sectioning, the mass appears to extend\nthrough the left wall for a distance of 1.5 cm and is 0.2 cm from the soft tissue line of resection (inked\nblack). It does not appear to involve the perivesicular adipose tissue. Purulent material is present upon\nsectioning of the left wall and left trigone. The remainder of the bladder wall appears edematous and\ndiffusely hemorrhagic. The hemorrhagic areas are predominantly visible on the posterior bladder wall. A\n3.0 cm segment of right ureter is present. It is probe patent. Its mucosa is slightly inflamed and\ngranular. A 2.0 cm segment of left ureter is present. It Is probe patent and its mucosa is inflamed and\ngranular. The prostate measures 3.0 cm anteroposteriorly, 3.2 cm craniocaudally, and 4.0 cm\ntransversely. The capsular surface appears slightly roughened but complete. The gland is inked blue on\nthe right and yellow on the left, and sectioned from the apex to base transversely at 3 mm intervals\nperpendicular to the urethra. The cross sections reveal a yellow-tan mottled cut surface. A definitive\nmass is not identified. Rubbery nodularity is present. The seminal vesicles appear unremarkable.\nSegments of vas deferens appear unremarkable. Sectioning of the attached fibroadipose tissue reveals\nthree tan-white firm nodules, resembling lymph nodes ranging in size from 0.3-0.6 cm in greatest\ndimension. Representative sections are submitted In formalin as follows: El right distal ureter shave,\nE2 left distal ureter shave, E3-E4 anterior bladder wall, E5 left wall to include deepest extent of lesion,\nE6 left ureteral orifice, E7-E8 left trigone, E9 posterior wall demonstrating hemorrhagic mucosa, El 0\ndome demonstrating hemorrhagic mucosa, E11 right ureteral orifice, E12 right wall, E13 right trigone,\nE14 right ureteral mucosa (1.0 cm from distal margin), E15 left ureter mucosa (1.2 cm from distal\nmargin), E16 lymph nodes (3), Ell right apex, E18 left apex, E19 3 mm right, E20 3 mm left, E21 15\nmm right anterior (capsular surface incomplete), E22 15 mm right posterior to include seminal vesicles,\nE23 left anterior (capsular surface incomplete), E24 15 mm left posterior to include seminal vesicles.\nPage 4 of 10 SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT\nGross Description:\nF.

Bladder, ovaries, uterus, fallopian tubes and cervix; Sections from the\nmacroscopically identified lesion confirm a poorly differentiated solid\nurothelial carcinoma arising from surface carcinoma in situ and extending the\nfull thickness of the bladder wall to extend into the perivesicle fat.\nThe tumour invades with broad fronts and does not elicit a lymphocytic\ninfiltrate at the tumour host interface. Lymphovascular invasion is frequent.\nThere is occasional perineural invasion.\nThe tumour extends to within 4 mm of the circumferential surgical resection\nmargin. The background bladder wall is within morphologically normal limits.\nThe urethral surgical resection margin shows squamous metaplasia only. Bladder\nwall also contains a mesonephric duct remnant.\nThe tumour cells themselves are markedly pleomorphic and have moderate amounts\nof eosinophilic cytoplasm. There are numerous admixed giant cells some which\nare osteoclastic type. They do not have trophoblastic differentiation. No\nbackground sarcomatoid change or heterologous elements are noted.\nThe sections of the uterus and cervix confirm inactive endometrium, two\nsubserosal small leiomyomas, normal cervix and normal adenexae.\nThe nodule identified separately in the remnant fat away from the main specimen\nis a lymph node with metastatic carcinoma with extracapsular extension.\nB.

        "llm_output": " Site: Bladder and prostate\nLaterality: Not provided\nHistology: Based on the description of the indurated lesion, tan-gray appearance, and ulceration, the specimen is consistent with a malignant tumor, possibly urothelial carcinoma.\nStage: The tumor appears to invade the left seminal vesicle and vas deferens, and there is concern for lymph node metastasis. Therefore, the stage may be at least T3bN1M0 (AJCC 8th edition).\nGrade: Not provided in the description.\nBehavior: Malignant, as evidenced by the invasion of surrounding structures and potential for lymph node metastasis.\n\nJustification: The site is identified as the bladder and prostate, with a large, indurated lesion present in the bladder. The lesion's appearance and involvement of the left ureter orifice suggest malignancy, likely urothelial carcinoma based on typical bladder cancer presentation. The stage is estimated based on the tumor's invasion into surrounding structures and potential lymph node metastasis. Grade is not provided in the description. The behavior of this lesion is malignant due to its aggressive characteristics, including invasion and possible metastasis."

Container B is received fresh for frozen section additionally labeled 'left ureter' and contains a 0.6 cm in length x 0.7 cm in diameter yellow-tan\ncylindrical soft tissue, which also bears a clip at one end. Representative section is submitted for frozen section with the residual entirely resubmitted for\npermanent section in cassette 131 labeeet\nC. Container C is received with formalin additionally labeled 'uterus , cervix, right ovary and bladder\" and contains an anterior exenteration specimen\ncomprised of bladder (8.0 x 7.0 x 6.0 cm), urethra (3.0 cm in length x 1.0 cm in diameter), anterior vaginal wall (6.5 x 4.5 cm), right ureter (5.0 cm in\nlength x 0.4 cm in diameter), leftureter (4.5 cm in length x 0.5 cm), uterine cervix (2.0 cm in length x 4.3 x 3.2 cm), uterine corpus (4.5 cm in length x 4.0\nx 2.5 cm), right adnexal complex (4.5 x 3.0 x 2.0 cm), and attached perivesicular fat A left uterine adnexal complex Is not present The soft tissue\nmargins are inked. The bladder is opened to reveal a 7.5 x 6.5 x 1.5 cm yellow tan fungating and friable mass that involves the anterior, right and left\nlateral bladder wails, as well as the bladder dome. This mass approaches to within 0.1 cm of the right ureteral orifice, 1.5 cm of the left ureteral orifice\nand 7.0 cm from the urethral margin. Normal appearing pink-tan focally erythematous but glistening bladder mucosa is present near the trigone. On\nsection, this mass extends into the detrusor muscle and approaches to within 0.1 cm of the inked deep margin, as well as to within 0.1 cm of the inked\ndeep peritonealized surface .This mass does not involve the uterine wall. The endocervical canal is yellow-tan cystic and mucoid with the usual folds.\nThe triangular endometrium Is pink -tan and glistening with an average thickness of 0.1 cm. The posterior aspect is remarkable for 1.0 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm\npink-tan polypoid lesion .On section, no areas of invasion are identified. The surrounding myometrium is pink- tan and fibrous with an average thickness\nof 1.0 em. Within the myametrium on the posterior aspect is a 0.7 cm well delineated intramural nodule which features a yellow-tan diffusely calcified cut\nsurface. Sections through the right adnexal complex reveals a 3.5 cm in length x 0.5 cm in diameter segment of firnbriated fallopian tube. The yellow tan\nlobulated right ovary is 2.5 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm.

Received already fixed, inked, and opened labeled \"bladder and prostate\" is a specimen that\nconsists of urinary bladder, right ureter, prostate, attached seminal vesicles and vas deferens. The right\nureter is probed but there is no probe identifying the left ureter and the left ureter orifice in the trigone\narea could not be seen or probed and after dissection a possible 3cm segment of left ureteris seen.The bladder measures 19 x 11 x 5 cm. The adhered surface of the bladder is covered by a smoothserosallining at the dome and fibroadipose tissue at the remaining portion. After the bladder is opened,\na mass measuring 5 x 4 x 1 cm is identified and is located on the anterior wall, right lateral wall, leftlateral wall, posterior wall and the trigone area .The mass is 4 cm from the right ureter margin, 3.5 cm\nfrom the urethral margin, and 3.5 cm from the possible left ureter margin, and appears to invade 1 cmdeep.The mass is principally papillary. On sectioning, the mass extends to roughly 1 cm grossly into\nthe wall but does not grossly appear to go through the muscularis propria. It does not appear to involve\nthe perivesicular adipose tissue. The bladder mucosa is erythematousnear the urethra. A 4 cm\nsegment of right ureter and is patent, and the mucosa appears unremarkable. The left ureter was very\ndifficult to locate as there is no probe within it for fixation and the orfce in the trigone area could not be\nIdentified. A possible 3 cm segment of left ureter is identified after dissection. Its mucosa appears\nunremarkable. The prostate measures 4 x 4 x 4 cm cranlocaudally, anteroposteriorly, and transversely.\nThe apex of the gland is conical. The capsular surface is smooth. On palpation, an area of firmness is\nnot identified. The gland Is inked blue on the right, and yellow on the left. After fixation, the gland is\nserially sectioned at 3 mm intervals and the cross sections do not reveal a masslesion .Rubberynodularity is present. The seminal vesicles appear unremarkable. Representative sections are\nsubmitted as follows: FSA1 urethra, FSA2 suture, FSA3 left vas deferens, FSA4 right vas deferens,\nFSA5 right ureter, FSA6 left ureter, A8 anterior wall with mass, A9 right trigone area and right ureter\nwith mass, Al0 right lateral with mass, All dome, A12 left lateral wall with mass, A13 possible left\nureter distal margin, A14 left trigone area with mass, A15 mass in relation to right seminal vesicle, A16\nbladder mucosa near urethra, A17 posterior wall with mass, A18 possible mid left ureter, A19 right mid\nureter, A20-A21 possible lymph nodes, A22 right apex, A23 left apex, A24 3 mm right, A25 3 mm left,\nA26 mid prostate right anterior, A27 mid prostate left anterior, A28 mid posterior right posterior, A29\nmid prostate left posterior, A30 base of prostate right anterior, A31 base of prostate left anterior, A32\nbase of prostate right posterior, A33 base of prostate left posterior, A34 right seminal vesicle, A35 leftseminal vesicle.\nB. Received fresh labeled \"pelvic lymph nodes #1\" are multiple segments of yellow fibrofatty tissue\naggregating to 10 x 5 x 1.5 cm. Palpation reveals 17 yellow firm nodules ranging in size from 0.5 to 4.0\ncm in greatest dimension. The nodules are totally submitted as follows: 131 four nodules, B2 four\nnodules, B3 four nodules, B4 two nodules, B5 one nodule, B6 nodule, B7 one nodule bisected.\nC.

The first container is additionally identified as, \"bladder\". Received fresh\nand place in formalin is a 145.08 g cystectomy specimen with overall\nmeasurements of 12.5 x 11.0 x 3.7 cm. The right ureteral stump measures 3 cm in\nlength and 0.4 cm in diameter, and the left measures 2.5 cm in length and 0.7 cm\nin diameter, and both demonstrate intact patent lumens. The serosal surface\nshows yellow, lobulated fibroadipose tissue with focal cautery artifact. There\nis a 2.5 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm matted area on left posterior bladder held together by a\nsuture which is removed to reveal a 1.6 x 0.9 cm defect and a 4.0 x 3.5 cm area\nof peritoneal discoloration on the right side adjacent to the dome. There is a\n7.4 x 7.0 cm portion of tan-pink vaginal mucosa fixed on the posterior aspect of\nthe bladder. The urethral margin is inked black, and the bladder is inked blue\non the right half and black on the left half. The bladder measures 6.0 x 5.5 x\n2.5 cm. The specimen is opened anteriorly to reveal a 2.5 x 1.7 cm red-tan,\nhemorrhagic, friable, ulceration located in posterior wall within an ill-defined 4.1 x 3 cm area of induration. On cut section, the mass is white-tan,\nindurated, and extends through the muscularis propria and pericystic adipose\ntissue and abuts the deep surgical margin (i.e. 2.5 cm of 2.6 cm of the total\nthickness of the specimen). Inferiorly, the induration also appears to abut the\nvaginal wall. The surrounding bladder mucosa is wrinkled, congested, pink-tan\nwith a uniform 0.5-0.9 cm wall thickness. Bilateral ureteral orifices, adjacent\nto the trigone, are identified and probe patent.\nRepresentative sections are submitted as follows:\nAl: Left ureter\nA2: Right ureter\nA3: Urethral margin\nA4: Uninvolved bladder mucosa anterior wall\nA5: Uninvolved bladder mucosa posterior wall\nA6: Uninvolved bladder mucosa bladder dome\nA7-A10: Bladder mass /Ulceration\nA 11-A 13: Bladder mass abutting the vaginal wall\nA 14 Fallopian tube\nA15-A16 Ovary\nB.

The extent of invasion cannot he\nascertained. The distance to\nleft pelvic surgical resection margin is approximately 12 mm. The background\nbladder mucosa appears normal.\nThe prostate shows some nodularity. A lymph node measuring 20 mm in maximum\ndimension is located deep to the tumour.\nPlease note\nThe resection margins and lymph nodes associated with this surgical procedure have\nbeen processed as\nMICROSCOPY\nPlease note\nThe following report includes the findings from the resection margins and lymph\nnodes processed as\nTl\u00bb tumour in the bladder is a poorly differentiated (Grade 3) urothelial carcinoma. It\narises from the surface and\ninvades through muscle to reach just beyond the muscularis propria into the\nextravesical fat. No unequivocal evidence of lymphovascular invasion is seen. The background bladder urothelium\nshows a focus of cystitis\ncystica.but no metaplasia, dysplasia or intraepithelial neoplasia.\nThe left and right ureteric resection margins show no evidence of tumour and are\nlined by normal urothelium.

Cylindrical piece of tissue 15mm in length x 3mm diameter.\nMICROSCOPY\n1. Sections taken from the macroscopically identified tumour show a poorly\ndifferentiated transitional cell carcinoma with a significant lipoid cell\ncomponent, extending through the bladder wall to reach the perivesicle fat.\nAreas of necrosis are noted. Extensive perineural invasion is seen. There is\nsome possible lymphovascular invasion.\nThe tumour host interface contains only a sparse lymphocytic infiltrate.\nThe overlying epithelium is largely denuded, but where present, is\nmorphologically normal with no evidence of dysplasia or carcinoma in situ.in\nRandom sections from the rest of the bladder wall shows morphologically normal\nurothelium.\nThe sections from both lobes of the prostate are morphologically normal.\nThe prostatic urethral resection margin shows no evidence of tumour or\ndysplasia.\n2.External iliac right; Reactive lymph node with no evidence of metastatic\ncarcinoma. 3.Right internal iliac; A reactive lymph node with no evidence of metastatic\ncarcinoma.\n4.Right obturator node; Three reactive nodes with no evidence of metastatic\ncarcinoma.\n5.Left obturator node and internal iliac; Nine reactive nodes with no evidence\nof metastatic carcinoma.\n6.Right para rectal lymph node; A lymph node with no evidence of metastatic\ncarcinoma.\n7.Right internal iliac artery; Sections confirm a muscular artery with medial\ndegeneration and dystrophic calcification.

Justification: There is no mention of laterality in the report, as it could be a non-lateralized organ or information not applicable.\n3. \"Histology\": Transitional cell carcinoma. Justification: The 'Formatted Path Reports' section mentions \"Histologic type: Transitional cell carcinoma\".\n4. \"Stage\": Not provided. Justification: The report does not contain enough information to determine the TNM stage, as it lacks details on tumor invasion into surrounding structures, lymph node involvement, and metastasis.\n5. \"Grade\": Poorly differentiated. Justification: The 'Formatted Path Reports' section states \"Histologic grade: Poorly differentiated\".\n6. \"Behavior\": Malignant. Justification: This is inferred from the diagnosis stating \"Infiltrating urothelial carcinoma\", which implies invasion into surrounding tissues, and the generally aggressive nature of transitional cell carcinomas."

The specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section in BFS.\nC:The specimen is received fresh from the O.R. and labeled \"Apical urethral\nmargin-f/s\". It consists of a piece of soft pink tissue measuring 1.5 x 0.3 x 0.2\ncm.The specimen is entirely submitted by for frozen section diagnosis in CFS.\nD:The specimen is received fresh from the Q.R. and labeled \"Bladder, prostate\".\nThe specimen overall measures 32 x 16.5 x 5.5 cm and is partially covered in a\nshiny, fatty, yellow-pink peritoneum measures 26.5 x 15. 5x less than 0.1 cm. The\nspecimen consists of a bladder (15 x 9 x 5.5 cm) and attached prostate (5 x 4.2 x\n3.3 cm). The right attached seminal vesicle measures 3.7 x 1.8 x 0.6 cm and the\nleft attached seminal vesicle measures 3.3 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm. The surgical margin of\nthe entire specimen is inked black, with the right side inked with, superimposed\nred.The specimen is opened along the anterior urethra revealing a prostatic\nurethra measuring 3 cm in length x 3 cm in circumference. The verumontanum\nmeasures 1.3 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm. The urethral mucosa is pink-tan, smooth, and does-not\nappear to be excavated. The bladder is almost entirely filled by huge, necrotic,\nbloody, friable, soft, exophytic mass which measures 14.5 x 8 x 5 cm. The mass\nappears to arise from the left lateral wall. Upon sectioning through the mass, the\ncut surfaces are coagulative, solid, soft and ranges in color from red to yellowish\nin a marbled pattern. Upon sectioning through the mass's relationship to the left\nlateral wall, it appears to arise from the solid, firm, light tan mass at the base\nand to extend into the bladder wall but not involve the underlying perivesical fat.\nThe tumor appears to be 1 cm from the inked black margin. Bilateral attached\nureters are opened. The right ureter measures 6 cm in length x 1.2 cm in\ncircumference and the left ureter measures 7.3 cm in length x 1.1 cm in\ncircumference. The ureteral mucosa are both grossly unremarkable. The remaining\nbladder mucosa is gray, congested, and grossly unremarkable elsewhere, except for\nthe trigone where there is a firm nodularity. The specimen is taken to the O.R. in\na gross consultation. The urothelium is fixed in B5 fixative for an hour and the\nspecimen is subsequently entirely fixed in formalin. The prostate is serially\nsectioned from distal to proximal, revealing smooth, solid, grossly unremarkable, Page 4 of 6\nlight yellow cut surfaces. No gross tumors are noted in the prostate.

The tumor infiltrates the lamina propria and muscularis\npropria and into the superficial perivesical fat. The neoplastic cells invade as\nnests, cords, sheets and as single cells. They have high nuclear to cytoplasmic\nratios, hyperchromatic pleomorphic nuclei and prominent nucleoli. Multifocal\nlymphovascular invasion identified. The tumor involves the posterior wall and\nextends into the trigone and bladder neck distally and extends bilaterally to Page 6 of 6\nx:.:\u2022:u\u2022_:::_;t:.:^^ .t::c.\u2022_:_ r::r:-_:sae: ::f:::ur:\u00ab.:\u2022t.. ^+.:.^.e2-.__ ..s-^*r .'t^nsn .rw:.\u2022a:\n[!n w\u00abq^=cLy\n^PRlL'FM\u2022Ii ' ,\nW ; IN u\u00ab x 9 S - ?53 .

Sections of the tumor adjacent to the left seminal vesicle shows tumor\nin the perivesical fat but not involving the seminal vesicle. Sections that\ninclude the bladder neck show invasive tumor extending near but not involve\nprostatic tissue. Resection margins are free of urothelial dysplasia and\nmalignancy.\nSections of the prostate show a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma (E19),\ninvolving the right mid anterior prostate, Gleason' s score 6 (3+3). The tumor is\ncharacterized by single variably shaped and sized malignant glands that infiltrate\nthe stroma in a random fashion. The neoplastic cells are medium to large with high\nnuclear to cytoplasmic ratios, vesicular chromatin and prominent nucleoli. The\nprostatic capsule, periprostatic soft tissue and inked capsular margins are free of\ntumor. The bilateral seminal vesicles are free of tumor. No perineural invasion\nis identified. The non-neoplastic prostate shows benign prostatic hyperplasia with\nrare foci of high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN II). The\nprostatic urethra is free of urothelial dysplasia and the prostatic itself shows no\nevidence of invasive urothelial carcinoma.\nF-T:See final microscopic-diagnosis.\nSigned by: .\nELECTRONIC SIGNATURE\nPOST- OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS\nSame as preop\nPRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:\nMuscle invasive bladder TCC\nORDERING PHSYCIAN:Ordering Physician:",

It consists of a bladder with attached bilateral tubes and\novaries. Overall, the specimen measures 23 x 15 x 5 cm with a smooth, glistening,\nmobile peritoneum which is 18 x 12 by less than 0.1 cm. The bladder itself\nmeasures 7 x 7 x 3 cm. There is a soft pink vaginal cuff at the distal aspect of\nthe bladder urethra which is 2 x 2 x 2 cm. The specimen is inked black around the\nouter surface and the specimen is opened along the anterior aspect to reveal a\nlarge ulcerated tumor 5 x 2.5 cm in the -trigone area and focally in the proximal\nurethra. The urethra itself is 3.5 cm long by 1.5 cm in circumference and appears\nunremarkable. The rest of the bladder mucosa appears to be unremarkable. The\nbladder wall around the tumor is thickened 2.0 cm in thickness and the uninvolved\nwall is 0.5 cm in thickness. Both attached ureters are opened longitudinally to\nreveal unremarkable mucosa with the right ureter 6.5 cm long by 0.6 cm in\ncircumference and the left ureter 5.5 cm long by 0.6 cm in circumference. The\nspecimen is taken back to the O.R. to show the surgical staff in aid to the patient\ncare. The tumor is then serially sectioned to reveal grossinvasion through the\nmuscularis wall but not into perivesical fat grossly. Representative sections of\nthe tumor are submitted from C1 to C13. Representative sections of the normal\nbladder rnucosa are submitted in cassettes C14 through C18.

        "llm_output": " Site: The primary tumor site is identified as the bladder based on the pathological examination (E1-3, 5-7). Justification: These sections show high-grade invasive urothelial carcinoma, indicating the bladder as the origin of the malignancy.\n\nLaterality: The laterality of the primary tumor is not explicitly mentioned in the provided information. However, it can be inferred that both right and left sides of the bladder are affected based on the sections examined (E1-3, 5-7, Ell, E12, E13). Justification: Multiple sections from both lateral sides of the bladder show evidence of high-grade urothelial carcinoma.\n\nHistology: The histological type of the primary tumor is high-grade invasive urothelial carcinoma (E1-3, 5-7). Justification: These sections demonstrate the presence of a malignant epithelial tumor consistent with urothelial carcinoma.\n\nStage: The stage of the primary tumor is not explicitly provided in the given information. However, based on the pathological findings, it can be classified as at least muscle-invasive (T2) urothelial carcinoma. Justification: The tumor extends into the deep muscularis propria without involving perivesical soft tissue, indicating a T2 stage.\n\nGrade: The grade of the primary tumor is high grade, as evidenced by sections E1-3, 5-7. Justification: These sections show grades 3 and 4/4 urothelial carcinoma, which indicates a high-grade malignancy.\n\nBehavior: The behavior of the primary tumor is malignant due to its invasive nature and high-grade characteristics. Justification: High-grade invasive urothelial carcinoma has a strong potential for local invasion and metastasis, making it a malignant neoplasm."

The tumor's size and location suggest a significant, malignant process, which would be classified as at least pT3b based on the TNM staging system for bladder cancer. However, without more information, such as depth of invasion or lymph node involvement, a definitive stage cannot be assigned."

The bladder\nmeasures 8.0 x 8.0 x 4.0 cm, the prostate measures 4.0 x 4.0 x 4.0 cm, the right seminal vesicle measures 4.5 x 2.5 x 0.5 cm, the\nright vas deferens measures 8.0 cm in length x 0.2 cm in diameter, the left seminal vesicle measures 4.5 x 1.5 x 0.6 cm, and the\nleft vas deferens measures 7.8 cm in length x 0.2 cm in diameter. The anterior aspect of the bladder is inked blue and the\nposterior black. The prostatic urethral margin is shaved and submitted. The bladder is opened along the anterior midline to reveal\na white-tan papillary mass measuring 4.5 x 4.0 cm which is grossly involving the left and right anterior wall and grossly appears to\nextend to the dome. The mass lies 5.5 cm from the left ureteral orifice and 5.3 cm from the right ureteral orifice. Both ureters are\nprobed patent measuring up to 0.2 cm in maximum diameter. The lesion is sectioned to reveal a white firm cut surface and\nextending to a depth of 4.2 cm. The mass is 0.2 cm from the inked fat. There is a scar noted on the left posterior wall measuring\n1.5 x 0.3 cm, located 3.0 cm from the left ureteral orifice and 4.5 cm from the right ureteral orifice. In addition, there is a white-tan\nfirm scarred area noted on the right posterior wall measuring 0.5 x 0.3 cm, located 3.5 cm from the left ureteral orifice and 1.5 cm\nfrom the right ureteral orifice. The posterior bladder mucosa is red-brown, congested with ill-defined areas of nodularity. Discrete\nperivesical lymph nodes are grossly identified. The prostate is serially sectioned to reveal a diffuse firm parenchyma with a\nwhite-tan whorled appearance. There are several white nodules noted ranging from 0.2 to 0.6 cm in diameter and multiple cysts\nranging from 0.1 to 0.2 cm in diameter.

Justification: The site is explicitly mentioned for most specimens in the surgical pathology report.\n\nLaterality: Most of the specimens were labeled by laterality, including left and right sides of the urethra, vas deferens, ureters, and periureteral tissue. Justification: Laterality is provided for most specimens in the surgical pathology report.\n\nHistology: The histology was described for some specimens, including benign prostatic tissue, adipose soft tissue, and tan soft tissue. However, many specimens did not have a specific histologic diagnosis mentioned. Justification: While some specimens had a histologic diagnosis provided, many did not, making it difficult to categorize them based on histology.\n\nStage: The stage was not provided for any of the specimens in the surgical pathology report. Justification: There is no information available regarding the staging of the specimens.\n\nGrade: The grade was not provided for any of the specimens in the surgical pathology report. Justification: There is no information available regarding the grading of the specimens.\n\nBehavior: The behavior was not applicable for any of the specimens in the surgical pathology report, as they were all excised or removed for diagnostic purposes and were not malignant.

On sectioning, focal areas of soft papilliferous\nwhite-pink tissue in keeping with tumor are identified. A portion\nof the presumptive tumor is submitted for tissue procurement as\nrequested. Received separately within the specimen container is a\ncopious amount of red-brown clot. No anatomic structures are\nevident. Random representative sections focusing on the apparent\ntumor are submitted in eight blocks. RS-8. RR1-8 additional\nsections submitted to evaluate for the presence or absence of\nmuscle\ninvasion.\nMICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION\nMicroscopic examination reveals extensive high grade\nurothelial carcinoma with some clear cell differentiation.\nThe tumor is extensively exophytic. Invasion of lamina propria is\nidentified in tissue block 6 and RR3. Muscularis propria is\npresent. And some foreign body giant cell reactions are identiifed\nin the muscularis propria sections. However, no diagnostic\ninvasive\ntumor is identified in those sections of muscularis propria. The\nlack of orientation of the specimen precluded accurate margin\nevaluation. The exophytic friable nature of the tumor also\nprecluded accurate margin evaluation.\nMICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION\n5\nDIAGNOSIS\nA.

Multiple yellow-brown\nfirm-rubbery lymph node candidates are dissected from the specimen ranging from\n0.2-4.0 cm in greatest dimension. Representative sections are submitted as\nfollows:\nBI-B3: multiple lymph node candidates\nB4,B5: one matted lymph node candidate, bisected\nC. Container C is further designated 33. bladder and prostate4. Received fresh\nand placed in formalin is a specimen of cystectomy weighing 395 gm and the\noverall measurement is 14.5 x 10.5 x 6.0 cm. The bladder measures 9.0 x 8.5 x\n5.5 cm and the prostate measures 4.0 x 3.3 x 3.0 cm. The bladder is opened from\nthe anterior wall with a Y-shaped incision . A gray-white, firm, ulcerated mass\nis identified in the posterior wall of the bladder measuring 6.3 x 5.1 cm and\nraised 2.8 cm from the bladder mucosa. Multiple small papillae are identified\nin the periphery of the mass. The outer surface of the bladder and the prostate\nis inked black on the left side and blue on the right side. Probing through the\nureters reveals that both ureteral orifices are involved by the tumor. The\nspecimen is serially sectioned. Both ureters are surrounded by solid tumor.\nThe tumor displays a thickness of 5.0 cm. The tumor grossly invades through the\nbladder wall but not through the surrounding adipose tissue. The center of the\ntumor is white and soft and grossly necrotic. The prostate and the seminal\nvesicles are not grossly invaded by tumor. No lymph nodes are identified in the\nperi-bladder adipose tissue. Received in the same container is a 4.8 cm round\ntubular tissue with a diameter of 0.4 cm.

Laterality: Not provided - The form does not include any information regarding the laterality (left or right side) of the suspected tumor.\n3. Histology: Invasive ductal carcinoma - The pathology report mentions a \"mass infiltrating into the surrounding tissue,\" which is consistent with this type of breast cancer.\n4. Stage: pT2 N60 Mo Stage II - Based on the number of positive lymph nodes (6 out of 18 examined), the tumor size (>2 cm), and no evidence of distant metastasis, the stage appears to be II.\n5. Grade: Not provided - The form does not include any information regarding the grade of the tumor, which is a measure of how aggressive the cancer cells appear under the microscope.\n6. Behavior: Malignant - Invasive ductal carcinoma is a type of malignant tumor that can invade surrounding tissue and metastasize to other parts of the body."

Page 6 of 6\nC:Sections of bladder show an extensive poorly differentiated invasive papillary\ntransitional cell carcinoma (C11-16), nuclear grade 4/4, located grossly at the\nleft inferolateral bladder wall approximating the bladder neck and invading into\ndeep muscularis propria and approaching but not involving the perivesical fatty\ntissue.The tumor is characterized by a large (grossly 2.1 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm)\npapillary proliferation of tumor cells with moderate to marked pleomorphism. The\nnuclear to cytoplasmic ratio is markedly increased in many cells, and the nuclei\nare round to oval, some showing large nucleoli. Numerous mitotic figures are seen\nas well as necrosis. The tumor deeply infiltrates into the muscularis propria with\nthe closest inked radial margin located 0.4 cm from the tumor (C13).\nLymphovascular invasion is identified (C11). The left ureterovesical junction is\nuninvolved. The tumor is located 0.6 cm from the anterior vaginal wall (C12). All\nresection margins are free of both malignancy and urothelial dysplasia. Additional\nsections of bladder showfocal areas of erosion and mild to moderate chronic\ncystitis with lymphoid aggregates identified. Mild dysplasia is seen in the\ntrigone but no foci of high-grade dysplasia or in situ carcinoma (flat lesion) are\nidentified. In addition, a focal foreign body giant cell reaction is seen (CS)\nconsistent with previous biopsy site.\nSections of anterior vaginal wall show benign squamous epithelium. Sections\nfrom the cervix show benign cervical glandular epithelium and the endometrium\nexhibits atrophic changes. Small intramural leiomyomas are identified. The right\novary shows benign physiological changes and the right fallopian tube is\nunremarkable. There is no evidence of atypia or malignancy.\nSigned by:\nELECTRONIC SIGNATURE\nPOST-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:\nSame as preop\nPRE-OPE RATIVE DIAGNOSIS:\nBladder cancer\nORDERING PHSYCIAN:Ordering physician:",

The right seminal vesicles\nmeasure 4.2 x 1.7 x 0.9 cm and right vas deferens measures 9.5 cm in length by\n0.2-0.5 cm in diameter. The left seminal vesicles measures 4.5 x 1.6 x 0.8 cm\nand left vas deferens measures 10.5 cm in length by 0.2-0.5 cm in diameter. The\nright ureteral stump measures 1.6 cm in length by 0.6 cm in diameter, the left\nmeasures 2 cm in length and 0.6 cm in diameter, and both demonstrate intact,\npatent lumens to the trigone.\nThe right half of the prostate is inked blue and the left half is inked black.\nThe soft tissue surrounding the bladder is inked black. The bladder and prostate\nare opened anteriorly along the urethra. The prostate is surrounded by a thin,\nintact membranous capsule and sectioning demonstrates rubbery, pink-tan,\nperi-urethral nodularity with no discrete masses or indurations.

The prostate measures 30mm SI, 30mm ML x 21mm AP.\nAttached\nfibrofatty tissue measures up to 120mm maximum dimension. No lymph nodes\nidentified.\nIn the left lateral wall of the bladder there is an ulcerated area 20mm.\nUnderlying this is a hard tumour extending into perivessicular fat, measuring\n25mm St by approximately 25mm ML. The tumour extends for a depth of 22mm and\nis\nvery close to the left lateral soft tissue circumferential resection margin.\nElsewhere, on the right side of the urethral orifice is an area of mucosal\nirregularity 15 x 12mm.\nMICROSCOPY\nThe tumour seen in the left lateral wall of the bladder is a sarcomatoid variant\nof transistional cell carcinoma/high grade urothelial carcinoma. The tumour is\ncomposed predominantly of high grade malignant spindle cells with no\nheterologous elements evident. Superficially, the morphology of the tumour is\nmore reminiscent of a solid conventional high grade urothelial carcinoma and\nthere is some overlying carcinoma in situ from which the tumour appears to be\narising. There is no definite evidence of lymphovascular invasion.\nThe tumour invades through the muscularis propria into the perivessicular fat\n(pT3) and is 2mm from the circumferential resection margin at its closest point\n(block 3B).\nThe macroscopically abnormal area near the bladder neck shows evidence of oedema\nand increased vascularity associated with urothelial hyperplasia. There is some\npatchy dysplasia in this area which just amounts to CIS in a few foci. The\nprostatic urethra shows evidence of similar oedema and increased vascularity\nassociated with von Brunn's nests and hyperplasia but there is no evidence of\ndysplasia and the prostatic resection margin is clear of neoplasia.\nThe prostate, vas deferens and seminal vesicles show no significant abnormality.\nThe left and right distal ureteric resection margins (specimens 1 and 2) show no\ndefinite evidence of carcinoma in situ.\nSUMMARY\nCystoprostatectomy:\nSarcomatoid variant of high grade urothelial carcinoma.(G3,pT3)\n2mm clearance from left lateral circumferential resection margin.\nAdjacent carcinoma-in-situ.

        "llm_output": " Based on the given pathology report, here are the six categories with their corresponding information:\n\n1. Site: The specimens are taken from various sites including the bladder, prostate, and kidney, among others. This is important in identifying the origin of the tumor or abnormal growth.\n2. Laterality: Some specimens indicate laterality, which refers to the side of the body where the sample was taken. For example, some samples were taken from the left or right kidney or bladder.\n3. Histology: This category refers to the study of the microscopic structure of tissues. The report includes various types of histology such as adenocarcinoma, transitional cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma, among others.\n4. Stage: The stage of cancer is not explicitly provided in the report. However, some specimens are labeled as \"pT\" or \"pN,\" which are abbreviations for primary tumor and lymph node involvement, respectively. These labels suggest that the staging was already determined but not included in the report.\n5. Grade: The grade of cancer refers to how abnormal the cells look under a microscope and how quickly they are likely to grow and spread. This information is not provided in the report.\n6. Behavior: The behavior of the tumor or growth is also not explicitly stated in the report. However, some specimens are labeled as \"malignant,\" indicating that they are cancerous and have the ability to invade nearby tissues and spread to other parts of the body.\n\nJustification: These six categories are commonly used in pathology reports to provide a comprehensive description of the tumor or growth, its origin, characteristics, and behavior. They are essential in determining the appropriate treatment plan and prognosis for the patient."

The\nspecimen comes with an abundant amount of perivesicular adipose\ntissue attached. The cystoprostatectomy specimen consists of a\nbladder (6.5 x 5.5 x 5.0 cm) with attached right and left ureter\n(1.0 cm in length). There is a prostate (5.0 cm from\nleft-to-right, 3.5 cm from anterior-to-posterior, 3.3 cm from\napex-to-bladder-neck-margin) with attached right seminal vesicle\n(3.0 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm), right vas deferens (12.0 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm),\nleft seminal vesicle (3.5 x 2.5 x 0.6 cm), left vas deferens (3.0\nx 0.3 x 0.2 cm). The right side of the specimen is inked blue;\nthe left side of the specimen is inked black.\nIn the left anterior and posterior lateral wall of the bladder,\nthere is a 4.5 x 2.5 x 0.9 cm pink-tan polypoidmass.This lesion\nextends across the midline into the right anterior and posterior\nbladder and extends towards the bladder-prostate junction. ThePage 2 of 4 Page 3 of 4\nmass' cut surface is white-tan, firm and extends into the\nperivesicular fat. The mass at the posterior bladder, comes to\nwithin 0.5 cm to the perivesicular fat margin (inked black) and\non the anterior bladder is 1.0 cm. from the perivesicular fat\nmargin (inked black). The lesion is 2.5 cm from the nearest\nperitonealized surface. The ureteral orifices are patent. There\nare no other discrete masses or suspicious areas grossly\nidentified. The remainder of the mucosa is tan, glistening and\npliable.\nThe prostate has a white-tan cut surface with no discrete nodules\nor masses grossly identified.

Laterality indicates that the tumor is primarily located on the left anterior and posterior lateral wall. The histology is specified as urothelial carcinoma based on microscopic examination. The stage is determined by the invasion of the tumor into the perivesical fat, classified as pT3a. The grade is reported as high-grade, consistent with the description of marked atypia and poor differentiation in the microscopic description. Lastly, the behavior is malignant, implying that the tumor has the potential to invade surrounding tissues and metastasize."

This suggests a non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, most likely stage T1 (not provided).\n\nGrade: The grade of the tumor is not explicitly mentioned in the provided information. However, the presence of atypical urothelium suspicious for carcinoma in situ (CIS) in the left distal ureter biopsy may indicate a high-grade tumor.\n\nBehavior: The behavior of the tumor is malignant, as it shows features consistent with urothelial carcinoma."

The bladder cavity\nmeasures 5.5 cm superior to .inferior, 3.5 cm right to left, 3 cm\nanterior to posterior, andis completely filled with friable\npale tan tumor apparently broadly attached posteriorly\nassociated with pronounced induration of the bladder wall. on\nexamination of the posterior aspect the specimen segments of\nright and left vas extend for 4 cm on each side. The area of the\nright and left seminal vesicles is rather indurated with fat\nsurrounding the seminal vesicles somewhat more firm and pale tan\nthan usual. Scattered staple Lines are present along the\nposterior resection margin. The right side of the specimen is\ninked blue, the left side black. Upon sectioning, there appears\nto be tumor extending from the posterior prostate into the area\nof the right and left seminal vesicles bilaterally abutting the\nresection margin with the left seminal vesicle practically\nobliterated and the right better preserved. The tumor appears\nto abut the inked resection margin both in the area of the right\nand left seminal vesicle.

Entirely embedded for frozen section in cassette AFS.\nB:The specimen is. received fresh from the O. R. and labeled \"Apical urethral\nmargin F/S\". It consists of two strips of soft pink mucosal tissue which together\nmeasures 1.5 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm. Entirely submitted for frozen section diagnosis in\ncassette BFS.\nC:The specimen is received fresh from the O.R. and labeled \"Bladder/prostate\".\nIt consists of a cystoprostatectomy specimen which includes bladder and prostate.\nOverall, the specimen measures 27.5 x 11 x 4.5 cm with a smooth, glistening, mobile\nperitoneum which measures 23.5 x 10 by less than 0.1 cm. The peritoneum does not\nappear to be involved by tumor. The bladder itself measures 7.4 x 5 x 3.5 cm. The\nspecimen is palpated to reveal firmness involving the anterior bladder neck and\nthis area is inked black on the outside as well as the entire prostate. The\nspecimen is then opened along the anterior prostatic urethra to reveal a large,\nexophytic, fungating, firm, pink tumor involving most of the anterior bladder neck\nwall measuring 7.6 x 3.3 x 2.2 cm with the involved wall measuring 2 cm.in maximal\nthickness. The tumor approaches within less than 0.2 cm of the inked resection\nmargin. The tumor is split into half as the result of the opening incision. The\nuninvolved bladder wall measures 1.2 cm in thickness and the rest of the bladder\nmucosa appears unremarkable. Both ureterovesical junctions are identified and are\npatent. The attached ureters are opened longitudinally to reveal an unremarkable\nmucosa .The right ureter measures 6 cm in length and 0.5 cm in circumference, and\nthe left ureter attached to kidney measures 20 cm in length and 0.6 cm in\ncircumference. The prostate measures 5x 4.5 x 4.5 cm. The seminal vesicles are\npalpated from the posterior sidewith the right seminal vesicle measuring 2 x 1 x 1\ncm and the left seminal vesicle measuring 2.1 x 0.7 x 0.7 cm. The prostatic\nurethra appears excavated and measures 3.1 cm in length by 2.6 cm in circumference.\nThere is a focal areaof hemorrhage in the posterior wall of the urethra which\nmeasures 0.4 x 0.3 cm and which represents a possible biopsy site. The\nverumontanum itself measures 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm. Representative sections of the\nbladder tumor and bladder are submitted in cassettes C1 to C28. The prostate is\nthen serially sectioned from apex to base (1 through 9) to reveal gross hypertrophy\nof the transitional zone.Sections are submitted in cassettes C29 to C51.\nD: The specimen is received fresh from the O.

It\nconsists of a nephroureterectomy specimen which is attached to the bladder and\nprostate by its ureter (bladder and prostate represent part C) and overall measures\n21 x 12.4 x 4 cm, including the perinephric fat. The kidney itself measures 12 x 5\nx 3 cm. The ureter attached to the bladder measures 20 cm in length and 0.6 cm in\nexternal diameter. The kidney is bivalved and reveals unremarkable cortex and\nrenal medullary tissue. The renal pelvis appears slightly dilated. The junction\nof the proximal ureter and renal pelvis is narrowed to the extent that it is\ndifficult to open utilizing scissors .Once opened the circumference at the Page 4 of 6\nnarrowest point of the ureteropelvic junction is 0.4, but\nunremarkable. The mucosa of the entire ureter, ureteropelvic junction and renal\npelvis appears grossly normal. No mass lesions or other mucosal abnormalities are\nappreciated. The-opened specimen is demonstrated at this point to the surgeon. The\nvascular margins including renal artery and vein are then identified with the renal\nartery measuring 3 cm in length by 0.5 cm in diameter and renal vein measuring 3 cm\nin length by 1 cm. in diameter.

This includes the\ntrigone (CIO) and left ureterovesical junction (C8). Sections of the mass around\nthe bladder neck show a deeply invasive poorly differentiated urothelial carcinoma\n(C11-26), that focally involves the perivesical soft tissue (C19,25,26). Sections\nof the attached left ureter show focal reactive changes but no evidence of\ndysplasia or malignancy. No lymphovascular invasion is seen and all.resection\nmargins are free of both urothelial dysplasia and malignancy.\nSections of the prostate show unilateral prostatic adenocarcinoma (C30,43),\nGleason' s score 7 (3+4). Thecarcinoma is confined to the prostate without\ninvolvement of either the capsule or periprostatic soft tissue. Also seen are\nseveral foci of high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN III) [C29,341.\nThe prostatic urethra shows no evidence of urothelial dysplasia and no invasive\nurothelial carcinoma is seen in any of the sections of the prostate. Bilateral\nseminal vesicles show no evidence of malignancy. Resection margins are free of\nmalignancy.\nD:Sections of the kidney that include the entire ureteropelvic junction, show no\nurothelial dysplasia or malignancy. The mucosa of the renal pelvis is\nunremarkable. Sections of renal parenchyma show no significant histopathologic\nchange.

Extensive multifocal lymphovascular spaceinvasion is\npresent. Also present are several foci of the deceptively bland trabecular pattern\nsuperficially invading the lamina propria.\nSections of the cervix show cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN III) with\ngland duct involvement. No invasive cervical squamous cell carcinoma is\nidentified. Architecturally while the urethra is involved with urothelial\ncarcinoma, the ectocervix and cervical stroma are not, thus the two processes are\nphysically discontinuous.\nSignature Line\nSigned by:\nELECTRONIC SIGNATURE\nGROSS DESCRIPTION:\nA:The specimen is received fresh from the O.R. for rapid frozen analysis and\nlabeled \"Rt. distal ureter\".

Theprostatic urethral margin is shaved and\nsubmitted .The bladder is opened along the anterior midline to reveal a pink -tan papillary mass measuring 4.7 x 3.4 x 2.0 cm\npredominately on the left posterior wall. The lesion lies 0.5 cm from the left ureteral orifice and 1.5 from the right. Adjacent to the\npapillary mass is a 1.6 x 1.6 cm pink -tan scar lesion, which measures 0.1 cm from the left ureteral orifice ,and 3 .5 cm from the\nright.There is a 0.4 x 0.2 x 0.1 cm papillary area adjacent to the right ureteral orifice which measures 2.0 cm from the tumor. Both\nureters are probe patent, measuring up to 0 .2 cm in maximum diameter .Sectioning of the scar lesion reveals a tan cut which does\nnot extend to the inked fat. The mass is sectioned to reveal a white- tan slightly irregular cut surface. Extension to the inked fat is\ngrossly not identified. The remaining bladder mucosa is tan-pink with the normal folds .A perivesical lymph nods is identified.

The second container is additionally identified as, \"2. Left pelvic lymph\nnodes\". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 10 x 8.5 x 2.5 cm aggregate\nof soft yellow-tan fibroadipose tissue. The specimen is searched for lymph\nnodes, and 26 candidates are identified ranging in size from 0.6 cm up to 2.6 cm\nin greatest dimension. All of the lymph nodes are. submitted as follows:\nB 1-3: 6 nodes in each cassette\nB4: 4 nodes\nB5: 2 nodes\nB6-7: 1 node bisected in each cassette\nC. The third container is additionally identified as, \"3. Bladder and\nprostate\". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 554.8 g, 19.0 x 12.0 x 5.0\ncm cystoprostatectomy specimen consisting of a 9.5 x 7.5 x 4.0 cm bladder with\nattached mesenteric fat and a 5.5 x 4.0 x 3.8 cm prostate. The right seminal\nvesicles measure 4.5 x 2.2 x 0.6 cm and right vas deferens measures 7.5 x 0.3\ncm. The left seminal vesicles measures 4.5 x 1.8 x 0.7 cm and left vas deferens\nmeasures 8.0 x 0.3 cm. The right ureteral stump measures3.0 x 0.7 cm, the left\nmeasures 2.5 x 0.5 cm, and both demonstrate intact, patent lumens. Two detached\nsegments of vas measuring 7.5 x 0.3 cm and 8.0 x 0.3 cm are found separately in\nthe same container as the main specimen.\nThe right half of the prostate and bladder is inked blue and the left half is\ninked black. The bladder and prostate are opened anteriorly along the urethra.\nThe prostate is surrounded by a thin, intact membranous capsule and sectioning\ndemonstrates rubbery, pink-tan, peri-urethral nodularity with 0.9 x 0.6 x 0.6 cm\ndiscrete indurations in the left lateral half. The prostatic apex is disrupted\nalong the posterior aspect. Approximately 50% of the prostate is submitted.\nThe opened bladder reveals a 7.5 x 5.5 cm indurated ,hemorrhagic ,edematous,\nshaggy ,mucosa with central ulceration measuring 4.5 x 4. 0 cm located in the posterior wall, right lateral wall and right anterior wall. On cut section, the\nmass extends through the muscularis propria, and is 0.2 cm from the deep margin.\nThe greatest dimension of tumor extension to the margin is approximately 2.6 cm.\nThe urethral orifices and trigone are spared. The surrounding bladder mucosa is\nedematous, wrinkled, congested, pink-tan with a uniform 0.8 cm wall thickness.\nBilateral ureteral orifices, adjacent to the trigone, are identified and probe\npatent. Gross photographs are taken.\nRepresentative sections are submitted as follows:\nC 1: Left ureter resection margin\nC2: Right ureter resection margin\nC3: Urethral margin\nC4-C6: Distal prostatic (apex)\nC7-C8: Bladder mass/Ulceration, greatest invasion, tandem sections\nC9-C 10: Bladder mass/Ulceration, greatest invasion, tandem sections\nC 11-C 13: Bladder mass /Ulceration,\nC 14: Uninvolved bladder mucosa bladder dome\nC 15: Uninvolved bladder mucosa anterior wall\nC 16: Uninvolved bladder mucosa posterior wall\nC 17: Additional section of Bladder mass/Ulceration,\nC18-C25: Representative right lobe of prostate from apex to base\nC26 C33: Representative left lobe of prostate submitted from apex to base\nC34: Right bladder wall\nC35: Left bladder wall\nC36: Right vas deferens and seminal vesicle\nC37: Left vas deferens and seminal vesicle\nD. The fourth container is additionally identified as, \"4. Left distal ureter,\nsuture on non-margin side\". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 1.7 cm in\nlength by 0.6 cm in external diameter pink-tan portion of tubular tissue with a\nlumen consistent with ureter. One aspect is stitch indicating the non-margin\nside.. The non-margin side is inked in black, and the true margin side is inked\nin blue. Each side is shaved and submitted en face in D 1.\nE.

The other sections do not have a histological diagnosis in this report.\n\nStage: The stage is not provided in this report since it requires clinical and radiologic correlation, and it is not determined by the pathologic examination alone.\n\nGrade: The grade is not provided in this report as it depends on the type of tumor and its differentiation, which is not available in this report.\n\nBehavior: The behavior is not provided in this report since it requires a definitive diagnosis of the tumor or lesion, which is not available in this report.\n\nIn summary, this surgical pathology report contains representative sections from various sites with laterality specified for some sections and histology provided only for the frozen section diagnosis. The stage, grade, and behavior are not provided since they require additional information and correlation."

        "llm_output": " Site: The specimens are from various locations including presacral lymph nodes, bladder, prostate, seminal vesicles, perivesical lymph nodes, urachus, distal pelvic lymph nodes, and distal ureter. This information is explicitly provided in the description of each specimen.\n\nLaterality: The laterality is specified for some of the specimens. The bladder, prostate, seminal vesicles, perivesical lymph nodes, urachus, and one set of distal pelvic lymph nodes are from the right side of the body, while the left distal ureter is from the left side. The laterality for other specimens is not provided.\n\nHistology: The histology of the specimens is not explicitly provided in the description. However, based on the gross examination, it can be inferred that some specimens may contain neoplastic lesions, while others are normal or show non-neoplastic changes. For example, the bladder specimen contains a necrotic mass, and the prostate specimen shows a white whorled firm cut surface, which could suggest a neoplastic process.\n\nStage: The stage of the disease is not provided in the description. This information is typically determined based on the histological examination and other clinical and radiological findings.\n\nGrade: The grade of the tumor is not provided in the description. The grade refers to the degree of differentiation of the tumor cells, which can provide insight into the biological behavior of the tumor.\n\nBehavior: The behavior of the lesions is not explicitly provided in the description. However, based on the gross and histological examination, some specimens may show malignant behavior, while others may be benign or of uncertain behavior. For example, the bladder specimen with a necrotic mass may show malignant behavior, while the normal lymph nodes are likely to be benign."

        "llm_output": " Based on the pathology report, here are the six categories with one-sentence justifications:\n\n1. Site: Uterine Cervix\n   Justification: The report consistently refers to the site as the cervix, and there is no information suggesting a different primary site.\n2. Laterality: Not Provided\n   Justification: The report does not mention any laterality information, such as left or right-sided involvement.\n3. Histology: Squamous Cell Carcinoma\n   Justification: The report specifies that the tumor is a squamous cell carcinoma (E17) and provides further details about its characteristics.\n4. Stage: Not Provided\n   Justification: Although the report includes various measurements, it does not provide enough information to assign a formal FIGO stage for cervical cancer.\n5. Grade: Moderately Differentiated\n   Justification: The report mentions that one of the blocks (Block 2) shows moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, which is consistent with a grade 2 tumor.\n6. Behavior: Malignant\n   Justification: The pathology report describes a malignant tumor, as it confirms the presence of squamous cell carcinoma and provides details about its spread to surrounding tissues."

The third container is additionally identified as, \"3. Bladder\". Received\nfresh and place in formalin is a 150 g cystectomy specimen with overall\nmeasurements of 13.5 x 12 x 3.8 cm. The right ureteral stump measures 2.5 x 0.5\ncm, and the left measures 1.8 x 0.4 cm. The right ureter is patent to the\nsurgical margin. The serosal surface shows yellow lobulated fibroadipose tissue\nwith focal cautery artifact. The urethral margin is inked black, and the\nbladder is inked blue on the right half (including right ureteral stump) and\nblack on the left half. The specimen is opened anteriorly to reveal a 2.5 x 2.0\ncm centrally ulcerated mass occupying the posterior wall and left lateral wall\nextending to within 0.5 cm from the left ureter orifice. The left ureter orifice\nis only patent in the most proximal 0.5 cm. On cut section, the mass is firm\nand displays tan-yellow cut surface with focal hemorrhagic discoloration. The\nmass extends into and through the muscularis propria and is close to the black\nink. The surrounding bladder mucosa is wrinkled and pink-tan with a wall\nthickness of 1.6 2.1 cm.\nRepresentative sections are submitted as follows:\nCl: Distal urethral margin\nC2: Right ureter resection margin (blue) and left ureter resection\nmargin\nC3-C6: Closest extension of mass to ink\nC7: Mass in trigone\nC8: Section of mass and adjacent left ureteral orifice\nC9: Uninvolved anterior wall\nC 10: Uninvolved dome\nC 11: Uninvolved right lateral wall\nD. The fourth container is additionally identified as, \"4. Distal left ureter,\nsuture on non-margin side\".

The carcinoma extends into deep muscle (D3,7) but does not involve\nperivesical soft tissue and no lymphovascular space invasion is seen. Sections from the right lateral wall and\nthose adjacent to the tumor show areas of urothelial carcinoma in situ (D2,10,11). Random sections from the\nremainder of the bladder show no evidence of high grade urothelial dysplasia. Resection margins are free of both\n.dysplasia and malignancy.\nSections from the cervix show benign squamous and endocervical mucosa. The endometrium is atrophic. The\nmyometrium contains several small leiomyomas without evidence of cellular atypia or malignancy. Sections of\nbilateral ovaries and fallopian tubes show physiologic changes without atypical or malignant elements.\nE-S: See final microscopic-diagnosis.\nSignature Line\n.Signed by:\nELECTRONIC SIGNATURE\nGROSS DESCRIPTION:\nA: The specimen is received fresh from the O.R. and labeled \"Right distal ureter F/S\".

Effective January 1, 2010 this Checklist utilizes the 7th edition TNM staging\nsystem for Bladder of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and the\nInternational Union Against Cancer (UICC).\nComment\nOn part B. there is pagetoid spread of urothelial carcinoma in situ involving\nthe left ureter margin. Immunohistochemical stains performed on the distal left\nureter shows that the neoplastic urothelial cells are highlighted by CK20 and\np53 (nuclear) positivity. CD44 highlights the background urothelium. This\nimmunostaining pattern confirms the above diagnosis. Controls appropriate.\nInterpretation performed by the Attending Pathologist and reviewed with the\nResident/Fellow, [] M.D.\nElectronically Signed Out by [], MD\nClinical History:\nPatient is a year-old male with bladder cancer undergoing cystectomy.\nSpecimens Received:\nA: Left pelvic lymph nodes\nB: Distal left ureter\nC: Right pelvic lymph nodes\nD: Bladder, prostate, seminal vesicles, vas deferens\nGross Description:\nThe specimens are received in four containers each labeled with the patient's\nname and medical record number.\nA. The first container is additionally identified as, \"left pelvic lymph node\".\nReceived fresh and placed in formalin is a 4.5 x 4.0 x 1.5 cm aggregate of\nlobulated yellow fibrofatty tissue. The specimen is dissected for lymph nodes\nto reveal multiple apparent lymph nodes ranging from 0.2-2.5 cm in greatest\ndimension. All apparent lymph nodes are submitted as follows:\nA 1: 4 lymph node candidates\nA2-3: 3 lymph node candidates in each cassette\nA4: One lymph node candidate, bisected\nB. The second container is additionally identified as, \"distal left ureter\".\nReceived fresh and placed in formalin is an unoriented, 0.7 cm long segment of\nureter with small amount of adipose tissue attached. The specimen is sectioned\nand entirely submitted as B 1. C. The third container is additionally identified as, \"right pelvic lymph\nnodes\". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 5.0 x 4.5 x 2.7 cm aggregate\nof lobulated yellow fibrofatty tissue. The specimen is dissected for lymph\nnodes to reveal multiple apparent lymph nodes ranging from 0.5-3.5 cm in\ngreatest dimension. All apparent lymph nodes are submitted as follows:\nC 1: 8 lymph node candidates\nC2: 4 lymph node candidates\nC3: 3 lymph node candidates\nC4: 2 lymph node candidates\nC5-6: One lymph node candidate, bisected in each cassette\nD. The fourth container is additionally identified as, \"bladder, prostate,\nseminal vesicles vas deferens\". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 244.4\ngram, 15 x 11 x 4.5 cm cystoprostatectomy specimen with attached mesenteric fat.\nThe bladder measures 6.5 x 6 x 2.5 cm. The right ureteral stump measures 3.1 cm\nand the left 1.8 cm, and both demonstrate patent lumina. The prostate measures 4\nx 2.8 x 2.7 cm. The right seminal vesicle measures 2.2 x 1.1 x 0.5 cm and the\nright vas deferens 10 x 0.5 cm. The left seminal vesicle measures 2.8 x 1.3 x\n0.6 cm and the left vas deferens 9 x 0.5 cm. The right half of the prostate and\nbladder is inked blue and the left half is inked black. The prostate is opened\nanteriorly along the urethra and continued superiorly through the bladder in a\nY-shaped incision. The prostate is serially sectioned from apex to base to\nreveal unremarkable parenchyma. The bladder demonstrates a 4.5 x 1.8 cm\nulcerated area (lesion #1) involving the right posterior/lateral/anterior wall.\nSerial sectioning reveals tumor invasion into the muscularis propria to a depth\nof 0.8 cm, extending to 1.9 cm of the inked margin. There is another 1.4 x 0.7\ncm ulcer in the left posterior/lateral wall (lesion #2). Serial sectioning\nreveals invasion into [] to a depth of [] cm, extending to [] cm of the inked\nmargin. The remainder of the mucosa is tan-brown, edematous, and glistening with\na uniform 0.7 cm wall thickness. The bilateral ureteral orifices are identified\nand probe patent.

The left ovary is 2.5 x 2 x 1.1 cm with an\noverlying fimbriated fallopian tube, which is 5 cm in length and averages 0.6 cm\nin diameter. The surface of the uterine corpus is remarkable for an area of\nroughening, arising within the right cornu fundic aspect, which may represent\nsite of removal of tissues (see part D). Upon further bisecting the specimen,\nthe bladder is remarkable for diffuse thickening of the bladder wall,\nparticularly notable on the posterior aspect with ulcerated urothelium\nparticularly notable on the fundic aspect posterior wall with confluent\nextension involving the anterior aspect. This mass has extensive involvement of\nmultiple structures with overall estimated dimensions of 7.5 x 6.5 cm with\ninvasion into the uterine corpus/cervix for a depth of 4 cm and into the\nanterior superior aspect of the bladder for a depth of 2.5 cm (see also gross\nphotos). This mass approaches to within 2.5 cm of the urethral margin of\nsurgical resection. Both the left and right ureters are grossly probe patent\nwith an average length of 6 cm, each which open into a markedly edematous\ntrigone. This tumor abuts the perivesical fat adjacent to the left\nadnexa/uterine corpus. Additionally this tumor does approach the\nsuperior/posterior aspect of the bladder adjacent to the \"bladder flap\" site\n(see cassette C11). There is no gross evidence of tumor involvement of the\nsurface of the vaginal patch or into the adnexal structures.\nSections are submitted as follows: These lymph node candidates are submitted as follows:\nF1-2 one whole lymph node bisected,one half in each cassette;\nF3-4 one whole lymph node quadrisected,one half in each cassette.\nMicroscopic Description:\nThe final diagnosis of each specimen incorporates the microscopic examinationfindings.\nEND OF REPORT\nTaken: .

This suggests that the site of origin for the tumor is most likely the uterus or ovaries.\n\nLaterality: Not provided, as the report does not specify whether the tumor occurred on the left or right side of the body.\n\nHistology: The tumor is described as a \"tan-brown friable mass\" with areas of necrosis and hemorrhage. These features suggest that the tumor is likely a high-grade malignancy, such as serous carcinoma or clear cell carcinoma.\n\nStage: Not provided, as the report does not include information on the extent of the tumor or whether it has spread to other parts of the body.\n\nGrade: The grade of the tumor is not explicitly stated in the report, but its description as a \"friable mass\" suggests that it is high-grade.\n\nBehavior: The behavior of the tumor is not explicitly stated in the report, but its malignant nature and presence of necrosis suggest that it is aggressive and has the potential to spread or metastasize."

Sections of the\nleft side of the tumor show microscopic infiltration through the\ndetrusor muscle into perivesical soft tissues for a distance of 0.1 cm.\nThe tumor does not extend to the radial soft tissue margin.\nCarcinoma in-situ is present in every section of the bladder and is\npresent at left ureteral margin. Previous biopsy situ changes are\nobserved in sections of the trigone. Sections of the prostate show\nbenign prostatic tissue with no tumor extension.\nI have personally reviewed all specimens and or slides, including the\nlisted special stains, and used them with my medical judgement to\ndetermine the final diagnosis.\nCLINICAL HISTORY: This is a ear-old male with a history of bladder cancer, undergoes\nradical cystectomy with attached prostate and lymph node dissection.\nGROSS:\nSix specimens are received, each labeled with the patient's name and\nhospital identification number.\nA. Specimen A is designated \"left pelvic lymph nodes.\" The\nspecimen consists of a 6.5 x 5.2 x 3.2 cm aggregate of yellow lobulated\nadipose tissue containing multiple potential lymph nodes ranging in size\nfrom 2.0 to 0.4 cm in greatest dimension. All lymph nodes are removed\nand submitted in six cassettes.\nB. Specimen B is designated \"right pelvic lymph nodes.\" The\nspecimen consists of a 6.3 x 5.5 x 2.2 cm aggregate of yellow lobulated\nadipose tissue containing multiple potential lymph nodes ranging in size\nfrom 2.5 to 0.5 cm in greatest diameter. All lymph nodes are submitted\nin six cassettes.\nC. Specimen C is designated \"bladder, prostate, seminal\nvesicles.\" The specimen consists of a 19.2 x 13.1 x 4.5 cm bladder with\nassociated adipose tissue. The prostate measures 4.0 x 2.9 x 2.8 cm.\nThe specimen is inked as follows: right hemisphere - blue, left\nhemisphere - black. The apical margin is removed and submitted for frozen section diagnosis as CFS1. The remainder of the specimen is open\nalong the anterior midline revealing a papillary, exophytic appearing\nlesion tethered to the anterior aspect of the mucosal surface measuring\n5.6 x 2.1 cm, extending 0.5 cm into the lumen. This area is located\napproximately 0.2 cm to the right ureteral orifice, 1.2 cm to the left\nureteral orifice, 4.0 cm to the apical margin, and 1.5 cm to the\ntrigone. Sectioning of the lesion reveals that it infiltrates into the\nwall. Grossly the lesion is completely excised. The surrounding\nmucosal surface has a tan-red appearance. No additional lesions are\npresent. The prostate is sectioned revealing a fibrotic tan-gray cut\nsurface. Grossly no lesions are identified within the prostate. The\nspecimen is extensively sampled in 21 cassettes. No lymph nodes are\nidentified within the associated adipose tissue. Representative tissue\nwas procured for potential future studies from specimen C.\nD. Specimen D is designated \"left common iliac lymph nodes.\"\nThe specimen consists of a 2.6 x 2.6 x 1.5 cm aggregate of yellow\nlobulated adipose tissue containing an unremarkable yellow lobulated cut\nsurface. No lymph nodes are grossly identified. The specimen is\nentirely submitted in two cassettes.\nE. Specimen E is designated \"right common iliac.\" The specimen\nconsists of a 2.0 cm aggregate of yellow lobulated adipose tissue.\nGrossly the specimen is unremarkable. No lymph nodes are grossly\nidentified. The specimen is entirely submitted in two cassettes. F. Specimen F is designated \"hernia sac.\" The specimen\nconsists of a tan-red portion of fibromembranous soft tissue measuring\n1.0 x 0.8 x 0.3 cm. One surface has a smooth and intact appearance, the\nopposite is roughened. No evidence of thickening or complexity is\nidentified. The specimen is sectioned and submitted in cassette F.\nSummary of Sections:\nAl-A4 - lymph nodes.\nAS - single lymph node.\nA6 - single lymph node.\nB1-B3 - lymph nodes.\nB4 - single lymph node.\nB5-B6 - single lymph node (same node).\nC1- portion for frozen section.\nC2 - right ureter margin.\nC3 - left ureter margin.\nC4 -C5 - lesion , right bladder.\nC6 - lesion, right ureteral orifice.\nC7 - lesion, left ureteral orifice.\nC8-C9 - additional lesion, left hemisphere.\nC10 - uninvolved right bladder.\nC11 - uninvolved bladder dome.\nC12 - uninvolved bladder, left.\nC13 - trigone.

This constriction is due to the deeply infiltrating\ntumor in the urinary wall around the ureter. The tumor also involves bilateral\nseminal vesicles and vasa deferentia. The tumor is close to but does not involve\nthe colonic mucosa. The right resection margins appears grossly involved by tumor.\nThe prostate is cross sectioned perpendicular to the prostatic urethra and is\nunremarkable. The proximal and distal resection margins of the rectum are both\ngrossly free of tumor. The peritoneum is unremarkable.

Justification: The surgical pathology report includes the removal of various lymph node groups, ureters, bladder, and prostate, indicating multiple sites were involved in the cancer.\n\nLaterality: Right and left sides. Justification: The report mentions cancer involvement in right and left ureters, common iliac lymph nodes, external iliac lymph nodes, hypogastric/obturator lymph nodes, and Cloquet's lymph nodes, indicating laterality.\n\nHistology: Urothelial carcinoma. Justification: The report consistently refers to metastatic urothelial carcinoma throughout the findings, making this the primary histological type.\n\nStage: pT4a, N2 (Sf93), Mi. Justification: According to the TNM staging system, pT4a indicates the primary tumor invades surrounding structures; N2 signifies metastasis in 4-6 regional lymph nodes; and Mi represents microscopic satellite tumors or tumor deposits.\n\nGrade: Not provided. Justification: The surgical pathology report does not include information on the grade of the cancer, which is a measure of how abnormal the cancer cells look under a microscope and an indicator of how quickly the cancer might grow or spread.\n\nBehavior: Malignant. Justification: Given that this is a metastatic urothelial carcinoma case, it is inherently malignant with the potential to invade surrounding tissues and metastasize to distant organs."

The bladder measures 13.5 x 9.5 x 9 cm and is markedly distorted with an underlying non palpable mass. The prostate\nmeasures 4.5 x 4 x 3.8 cm. The right half of the prostate is inked green; the left half of the prostate is inked blue. The anterior\naspect of the bladder is inked black and the posterior blue. The prostatic urethral margin is shaved and submitted. The bladder is\nopened along the anterior midline to reveal a tan-yellow fungating predominately necrotic mass fulfilling the majority of the bladder\ncavity measuring 12.5 x 9.5 x 6.2 cm. The tumor is more closely associated with the left lateral wall, but extends into all regions of\nthe bladder, completely covering the left anterior and posterior wall, dome mucosa. The attachment of the tumor to the bladder\nmucosa is a 1.1 cm from the right ureteral orifice, completely obliterating the left ureteral orifice and is 4.2 cm from the prosthetic\nurethral margin. The tumor is sectioned to reveal extension through the bladder wall into the perivesicular fat, predominantly to the\nleft aspect. The remaining bladder mucosa at the right anterior/posterior wall and trigone is tan yellow and granular. The\nperivesicular fat is sectioned to reveal vascularity only. No perivesicular lymph nodes are identified. The prostate is serially\nsectioned to reveal a diffuse tan nodular parenchyma with an edematous left and right seminal vesicle. The tumor is 1.4cm from\nthe underlying vasa deferentia. Representative sections are submitted. The specimen is photographed.

Justification: The report mentions \"Urothelial carcinoma\" under the histologic type and specifies \"with variant histology: micropapillary\" later on.\n4. \"Stage\": pT3b N1 M0. Justification: The report indicates \"pT3b\" under pathologic staging, meaning the tumor has invaded through the bladder wall and into perivesical fat but not into adjacent organs or the pelvic or abdominal wall.

The bladder measures 2.0 x 5.5 x 4.5 cm. The external surface\nof the bladder is covered by smooth lining-at the dome and fibroadipose\ntissue of the remaining portion. After the bladder is opened, a firm white\npapillary-like mass is identified measuring 4.5 x 4 .0 x 2.0 cm within the\nposterior wall. The mass is papillary and solid. On sectioning, the mass\nextends through the muscularis propria into the perivesical adipose tissue\nretracting the overlying serosa. The serosal surface appears involved. The\nremaining bladder mucosa is unremarkable. The wall of the bladder appears\nthickened. A segment of right ureter measures 2.8 cm in length and is\npatent. Its mucosal surface is smooth and glistening. A segment of left\nureter is 2.2 cm in length and its mucosa is also unremarkable. The\nprostate measures 4.5 cm transversely, 3.0 cm anteroposteriorly and 3.0 cm\ncraniocaudally. The capsular surface is smooth. The gland is inked with\nblue on the right and yellow on the left and sectioned from apex to base\ntransversely at 3 mm intervals perpendicular to the urethra. The urethra\nhas been amputated in the same plane as the prostatic urethra, therefore, a\nshave margin cannot be obtained. Cross sections of the prostate reveal a\ntan solid cut surface without any definitive lesions. Rubbery nodularity is\nnot present. The seminal vesicles are unremarkable.

Total weight =\n460g. The bladder contains an extensively necrotic polypoid tumour on the\nposterior wall measuring at least 40 x 70 x 30 mm. The tumour is close to the\ndetrusor muscle and is 8 mm from the posterior serosal margin. There are\nbilateral ureteric stumps measuring 5 x 4 mm each.\nMICROSCOPY\nThere is a poorly differentiated, Grade 3, transitional carcinoma involving the\nlateral and posterior wall, close to and surrounding the right ureter. It\ninvades muscularis propria. It extends to within 9 mm of the prostate, but\nthere is no convincing evidence of invasion into the perivesical fat. Squamous\ndifferentiation is noted, but elsewhere the tumour has a spindle\ncell/sarcomatoid appearance. It does not show the lymphoepithelioma-like\nappearance suggested on the previous biopsy.\nNo vascular invasion has been identified. The circumferential margin is clear\nof tumour. Both ureteric resection margins are clear of tumour. The uninvolved\nbladder wall is severely inflamed and focally denuded of urothelium. Where\npresent, it shows some atypia but there is no evidence of carcinoma-in-situ.\nAlthough the urethral resection margin is clear of transitional bladder\ncarcinoma, there is a focus of prostatic adenocarcinoma at this margin (Block\nIA). There are further multiple foci of Gleason score 3 + 3 = 6 prostatic\nadenocarcinoma in both right and left prostatic lobes, measuring at least 14 mm\nin dimension. High grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, PIN, is also\npresent. There is no evidence of extracapsular extension.\nSUMMARY\n1-Transitional cell carcinoma of bladder G3 p1'2, completely excised.\n2 - Adenocarcinoma of prostate, Gleason score 3 + 3 = 6, pT2, at urethral\nresection margin.\nRef:\nPathologists -\nJA(' \u20ac^C.LL Yvt3 .. % C ^1^C l.3\no/.\ncca4e- of lath BC(a\nGke{ia J ?' yet N\nDiagnosis Discrepa cy\nPrimary Tumor Site Discrepancy\nHIPAA Discrepancy\nPrior Malignancy History\nDual/Svnchrom- Primary\nUse is (circle ): UAUF /DIQU IED\nReviewer Initials Date Reviewed _/.",

This information is crucial for determining the location and spread of the disease.\n\nHistology: The histology of the specimens is not explicitly provided in the description. However, given the context of cancer surgery and the mention of high-grade dysplasia, it can be assumed that the histology relates to urothelial carcinoma or a similar malignancy.\n\nStage: The stage of the disease is not explicitly mentioned in the specimen descriptions. However, the extent of tissue sampling suggests an advanced stage, as multiple sites and regions are being examined for cancerous involvement.\n\nGrade: High-grade dysplasia is mentioned for some specimens, indicating a high likelihood of malignancy with aggressive behavior. This information is essential for determining the appropriate treatment approach and prognosis.\n\nBehavior: The behavior of the disease is not explicitly stated but can be inferred as malignant given the mention of high-grade dysplasia and cancer surgery. Thorough examination of the specimens will help confirm the presence and extent of malignancy, informing treatment decisions and prognosis.\n\nNot provided: Some information such as the patient's medical record number, account number, visit date, discharge date, and attending physician is not provided in the description.

The anterior aspect of the bladder is inked blue and the posterior black. The prostatic urethral margin is shaved and\nsubmitted. The bladder is opened along the anterior midline to reveal hemorrhagic, ulcerated, indurated, necrotic tumor measuring\n5.0 x 4.8 x 1.8 cm which is grossly situated within the left and right posterior walls. The tumor grossly involves both the left and\nright ureteral orifices. Both ureters are probed patent measuring up to 0.2 cm in maximum diameter. The lesion is sectioned to\nreveal white-pink cut surface with invades the underlying fat. Possible extension to the inked fat is grossly identified. The remaining\nbladder mucosa is pink-tan with the normal folds. Two ovoid lesions measuring 0.6 x 0.4 cm are identified at the dome and right\nposterior wall. Discrete perivesical lymph nodes are grossly not identified. The prostate is serially sectioned to reveal white-tan\nprostatic parenchyma with multiple yellow foci and white fluid filled cysts identified. A gold thread-like material is identified within\nthe prostate. Representative sections are submitted sections from each prostatic quadrant and transition zone.

It consists of a bladder with attached prostate and seminal vesicles measuring 15 cm from superior to inferior,\n14.5 cm laterally and 4 cm from anterior to posterior. A stitch marks the left pelvic sidewall margin which is inked orange. The\nanterior aspect of the bladder is inked blue and the posterior black. The prostatic urethral margin is shaved and submitted. The\nbladder is opened anteriorly to reveal a tan-pink endophytic granular tumor measuring 6 x 5.7 cm which is grossly situated within\nthe dome and left posterior wall and grossly involve the underlying adipose tissue. Within the bladder is a 4 x 3.5 x 2.2 cm free\nfloating blood clot. The lesion lies 1.5 cm from the left ureteral orifice and 2.5 from the right. Both ureters are probe patent,\nmeasuring up to 0.2 cm in maximum diameter. The lesion is sectioned to reveal a maximum depth of invasion is 3.5 cm and\ngrossly approaches the inked fat and pelvic sidewall. The remaining bladder mucosa is tan-pink and focally edematous. Discrete\nperivesical lymph nodes are not grossly identified. The prostate is serially sectioned to reveal tan nodular cut surfaces. The\nspecimen is representatively submitted including two sections from each prostatic quadrant and transition zone.

The proliferative rate with Ki-67 stain is low (<5%). Inhibin and GFAP\nimmunostains were also performed, but the lesion was no longer present in the slides stained. These results support fallopian tube\nepithelial differentiation. The fallopian tubes were entirely submitted for histologic examination and additional abnormalities are not\nidentified.\nThe lesion is, therefore ,best considered a focus of epithelial hyperplasia.\nThis part of the specimen was reviewed in consultation with Dr. who concurs. Representative slides were also\nreviewed at the daily intradepartmental pathology consensus conference.\n*** Report Electronica llyWykSigned Out ***\nSigned out by\nuiitrb Jf/ 4 7 ^.7 r\niaenosis Discrepancy\nPrimary Tumor Site Discrepancy\nHIPAA Discrepas\nPrior I jAsnancy History\n1Dual/Synchronous Primaryry\u2022\nIa a is lcircle : QU/WFlED\nReviewer Initial.Yes Na\n/ D\"QUALIFIED\nviewed:.\nPage 6 of 6 END OF REPORT",

The third container is additionally identified as, \"3. Bladder, prostate,\nseminal vesicles, vas deferens \". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a\n514.6 g, 20.5 x 11 x 5 cm cystoprostatectomy specimen. The bladder is 8.5 x 8.5\nx 5 cm. The right ureteral stump is 4.5 x 0.5 cm and the left ureteral stump is\n3 x 0.4 cm. The prostate is 6.3 x 4.8 x 4.8 cm. The right seminal vesicle is 4.3\nx 2.3 x 0.9 cm and the right vas deferens is 11.8 x 0.4 cm. The left seminal\nvesicle is 4.3 x 2.4 x 1 cm and the left vas deferens is 6.5 x 0.5 cm. There are\n2 additional detached segments of vas deferens measuring 3.8 x 0.4 cm and 9.8 x 0.3 cm. The right half of the prostate and bladder is inked blue and the left\nhalf is inked black. The bladder and prostate are opened anteriorly along the\nurethra. The prostate is surrounded by a thin, intact membranous capsule and\nsectioning demonstrates rubbery, pink-tan, peri-urethral nodularity and a 3.5 x\n1x 1 cm area of firm, tan-white induration along the posterior aspect\nbilaterally. The seminal vesicles contain dilated cystic spaces filled with\ntan, gelatinous material. The opened bladder reveals a 3 x 2.7 cm ulceration\nlocated in the right posterior/lateral wall with a 5 x 4.2 cm surrounding area\nof hemorrhagic mucosa. The remaining bladder mucosa is edematous, wrinkled and\npink-tan with a uniform 0.2 cm wall thickness. The bladder is serially\nsectioned to reveal tumor grossly extending to a depth of 1.4 cm which is 2.4 cm\nfrom the inked blue margin. Bilateral ureteral orifices, adjacent to the\ntrigone, are identified and probe patent.\nRepresentative sections are submitted as follows:\nCl: Distal prostatic urethral margin (apex)\nC2: Right and left ureter resection margin (right side is inked blue)\nC3-C5: Prostate apex, shaved and serially sectioned\nC6-C9: Representative right lobe of prostate from apex to base\nC 10-C 13: Representative left lobe of prostate submitted from apex to base\nC 14: Right seminal vesicle and vas deferens\nC 15: Left seminal vesicle and vas deferens\nC 16: Uninvolved bladder mucosa, posterior wall\nC 17: Uninvolved bladder mucosa, left lateral wall\nC18: Hemorrhagic mucosa, dome\nC 19: Uninvolved bladder mucosa, anterior wall\nC20-C30: Bladder mass/Ulceration (entirely submitted) with the deepest area of\ninvasion in cassette C20 (with inked margin deep to the area of invasion in\ncassette C21).\nD. The fourth container is additionally identified as, \"left distal ureter\nstitch on non-margin side\". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a rubbery\nwhite-tan tubular structure measuring 0.9 cm in length and 0.6 cm in diameter.\nThere is a stitch designating the non-margin side.

The specimen is received fresh for frozen section consultation, labeled, \"Soft tissue bladder margin (fs)\" and consists of a\nfragment of soft pink and yellow tissue (1.5x 0.6x 0.3 cm). The specimen is entirely frozen and submitted in one cassette.\nSummary of sections:\nFSC - frozen section control\n2). The specimen is received fresh labeled \"Urachus, perivesicular tissue lymph nodes, upper portion of bladder, bladder\ndiverticulum, distal right ureter\" and consists of a portion of bladder, diverticulum, portion of ureter, and perivesicular tissue. The\nportion of bladder is received opened with a dusky purple-pink but otherwise unremarkable mucosa measuring 8.6 x 7.5 cm with\nunderlying perivesicular tissue measuring 11.0 x 9.5 x 1.5 cm. The attached closed pouch like diverticulum measures 7.2 x 6.0 x\n3.0 cm and is attached by a 1.8 x 0.5cm piece of the opened bladder mucosa. The anterior wall of the diverticulum displays a\n1.8 x 1.5 cm transmural defect of a possible urachus, the tissue surrounding the defect is inked orange, the remaining anterior\naspect is inked black. The posterior surface of both the diverticulum and bladder perivesicular tissue are inked blue. The right\naspect of the diverticulum has an adhered segment of ureter measuring 3.0 cm in length by 0.5 cm in diameter. The ureter has\none clip and an opposing opened end. The diverticulum is opened to reveal a yellow-brown fungating papillary friable tumor\nmeasuring 4.7 x 4.3 x 1.5 cm, 4.1 cm from the transmural defect and 1.0 cm from the attached bladder mucosa. There is a\nsecond adjacent raised papillary nodule measuring 2.5 x 2.2 x 0.9 cm, 0.2 cm from the fungating tumor, 2.0 cm from the\ntransmural defects, and 5.6 cm from the attached bladder mucosa. Upon sectioning the two tumor nodules join and there is\npapillary extension to a depth of 1.8cm. The remaining bladder diverticulum mucosa is yellow and smooth. The tumor is 1.0\ncm from the attached ureter and the ureter is grossly uninvolved with the tumor. Both of the ureter margins are shaved and\nsubmitted en face. Perpendicular sections of the bladder mucosa margins are submitted ner clock face with 12 o'clock arbitrarily\ndesignated in pathology by the diverticulum attachment site.

In Part D\n(labeled final proximal margin of the right\nureter) the proximal specimen margin (slide Dl) is negative for dysplasia or\ncarcinoma. However the distal end of this specimen (slide 04) reveals nuclear atypia of urothelial carcinoma in situ. Because Of\nthe intense chronic inflammation, distinguishing\nreactive vs dysplastic changes are difficult. Immunohistochemical stain for\np53 was performed on slide D3 where the inflamed\nurothelium have atypical, round, slightly enlarged nuclei and prominent\nnucleoli. The stains highlights scattered positivity.\nThus based on the morphology and results of the immunohistochemical stain, the\natypical changes on slide D3 are regarded as\nreactive.

        "llm_output": " Site: The primary tumor sites are the bladder and the prostate. Justification: The pathology report includes sections from the bladder and the prostate with diagnoses of cancer in both organs.\n\nLaterality: The bladder cancer is not specified as to laterality, while the prostatic adenocarcinoma is predominantly on the left distal prostate. Justification: The report mentions that the bladder cancer is broadly extending through the muscularis propria and into the perivesical fat but does not specify if it is on one side or the other. Meanwhile, the prostatic adenocarcinoma is described as predominantly on the left distal prostate.\n\nHistology: The bladder cancer is a transitional cell carcinoma, while the prostate cancer is an adenocarcinoma. Justification: The report describes the bladder cancer as an invasive transitional cell carcinoma and the prostate cancer as unilateral prostatic adenocarcinoma.\n\nStage: The staging information for both cancers is not provided in this report. Justification: The report does not include any mention of the staging for either the bladder or the prostate cancer.\n\nGrade: The grade for the bladder cancer is not provided, while the prostatic adenocarcinoma is high-grade. Justification: The report does not include any mention of the grade for the bladder cancer, but it does describe the prostatic adenocarcinoma as unilateral and predominantly on the left distal prostate with a few areas of atypical glands in the right prostatic lobe. Two K903 stains performed show intermittent staining of basal cells around critical glands, supporting diagnoses of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and atypical basal cell hyperplasia.\n\nBehavior: The behavior for both cancers is not provided in this report.

The\ntumour is close to the seminal vesicles and the posterior resection margin.\nMICROSCOPY\nThe bladder contains an ulcerated poorly-differentiated micropapillary\ntransitional cell carcinoma with lymphovascular and perineural invasion. The\nsurface shows multinucleated giant cells amidst the granulation tissue. The\ntumour is confined to the posterior bladder wall. The tumour infiltrates beyond\nthe muscularis propria of the posterior bladder wall with microscopic invasion\nof vesical fat and is 2 mm away from the deep posterior margin. The tumour has\nan accompanying fibrous response and abuts but does not invade the seminal\nvesicles or prostate. Two separate deposits of tumour are seen distant from the\nmain mass, near the anterior wall.\nThe flat urothelium is not dysplastic.\nSee also for further information: both of the ureteric resections\nshow no evidence of malignancy.\nThe prostate shows hyperplasia and no evidence of prostatic adenocarcinoma nor\ninvasion by the bladder tumour.\nSUMMARY\nThe features are those of a grade 3 transitional cell carcinoma of\nmicropapillary type, pT3a Nx Mx.\nRef:\nPathologists -\nIQ5\na1^EiC-tilt ^ ^; oG&' cr,\nU-,43LOt C4,7 Z/\nCrn^H,1,,J i13011 !1Y\"t4Diagnosis moreoanry\nPrimary Tumor Site Disrreyaury\nHIPAA Discrepancy\nPrior Malignancy Hstory -^\nDual/ychronous Primary\nCase iscircle ): UAUP fjlIjylp(\nReviewer Initials Catr.

        "llm_output": " Site: The specimens were taken from various locations including left and right vas deferens, ureters, lymph nodes (common iliac, pelvic, pre sacral, external iliac), cloquet node, and perivesicle nodes. Justification: The site is where the tissue was taken from which helps in identifying the origin of the specimen.\n\nLaterality: Many of the specimens were specified as left or right sided. Justification: Laterality is important in determining if there are any differences between the two sides, and it can also help in identifying the location of the lesion or abnormality.\n\nHistology: The histology of the specimens includes benign lymph nodes, ureters, vas deferens, and prostate. Justification: Histology is the study of the microscopic structure of tissues, and it can help in diagnosing diseases or abnormalities present in the specimen.\n\nStage: The stage was not provided in the report. Justification: Staging is a way to describe where a cancer is located, if or where it has spread, and whether it is affecting other parts of the body. It helps doctors plan treatment and estimate a patient's prognosis.\n\nGrade: The grade was not provided in the report. Justification: Grading is a system used to classify cancer cells based on how abnormal they appear under a microscope, and how quickly they are likely to grow and spread. This can help doctors plan treatment and estimate a patient's prognosis.\n\nBehavior: The behavior of the specimens was described as benign. Justification: Behavior refers to whether the specimen is normal or shows signs of disease or abnormality. In this case, the specimens were all benign, meaning they were not cancerous and did not show any signs of abnormal growth or behavior."

BLADDER, TUBES, OVARIES AND VAGINAL WALL\nReceived fresh in a matching container and subsequently fixed in formalin is a cystectomy and bilateral\nsalpingo-oophorectomy specimen measuring overall 14.5 x 10.5 x 6.1 cm, including the urinary bladder\n(7 x 6 x 1.5 cm) and peri-cystic fatty tissue . The posterior fatty margin is inked black and the anterior\nsurface blue. A portion of tan smooth vaginal wall is demonstrated measuring 4 x 3cm. The urinary\nbladder is opened from the anterior aspect to reveal a fungating mass present on the right posterior\nlateral wall of the bladder with surface hemorrhage and ulceration, measuring 4.6 x 3.0 x 1.1 cm. The\ntumor is 2.5 cm from the closest urethral margin. The tumor appears to invade into the muscularis\npropria but not in the perivesicular fat. The tumor involves right ureter orifice but grossly does not\nappear to involve the right ureter. The remainder of the bladder mucosa is pink-tan and focally\nedematous. No other lesions are identified. The attached right fallopian tube is 5 cm long x 0.3 cm in\ndiameter, with a paratubal cyst 1.5 x 0.9 x 0.9 cm. The right ovary is 2 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm, The left fallopian\ntube is 4.2 cm long x 0.4 cm in diameter with fimbriated end. The left ovary is 2 x 1 x 1 cm.

The first container is additionally identified as, \"uterus ,cervix,\nbilateral tubes and ovaries ,urethra, bladder \".Received fresh and placed in\nformalin is a 236. 0 gm, 13 .5 x 11 x 5 cm pelvic exenteration specimen composed\nof a bladder ,uterus with complete adnexa ,cervix and vaginal mucosa. The bladder is 8.5 x 6 x 3 cm, tan-pink with a smooth glistening serosal surface. On\nboth the posterior wall and left lateral aspect of the bladder dome serosa there\nis a 2.5 x 1 cm area of slightly firm contracted bladder wall. The left ureter\nis 2.5 x 0.4 cm and the right ureter is 4.5 x 0.5 cm and each is probe patent.\nAttached at the inferior aspect is a segment of urethra that is 4.3 cm in length\nby 1.5 cm in diameter. The contracted serosal surface and the lateral resection\nmargins are inked black. The bladder is opened along the lateral walls to reveal\nan ulcerated granular tan-pink to red lesion (4.5 cm in length by 1.2-2.5 cm in\nwidth) extending from the posterior wall into the dome on the left lateral half\nof the bladder. The lesion appears to invade into the submucosa and into the\nposterior wall on the left lateral aspect of the bladder. There is a second\nulcerated contracted tan-pink granular lesion on the mucosa of the right\nsuperior-anterior wall measuring 1.2 cm in length by 1 cm in width. Between the\ntwo ureteral orifices, superior to the trigone on the posterior wall is a 0.7 x\n0.4 x 0.4 cm focus of transparent raised nodular tissue. The bladder is serially\nsectioned to reveal a scaly indurated tan-white cut surface with multifocal\nred-brown hemorrhage with attached soft yellow glistening adipose tissue. The\nlesion appears diffusely distributed across the cut surface of the anterior\nwall, posterior wall and bladder dome. The first lesion appears to invade to a\nmaximum depth of 1.4 cm and is close to the black inked serosa near the bladder\ndome. The second contracted lesion appears to invade to a depth of 1.1 cm. The\nbladder wall ranges in thickness from 0.9-2.1 cm. The remaining uninvolved\nbladder mucosa is tan-pink wrinkled and hyperemic. The perivesicular adipose\ntissue is dissected for lymph nodes and no lymph nodes are identified.\nAlso received as part of the specimen is a uterus with attached adnexa measuring\n4 cm from fundus to cervix by 4 cm from cornu to cornu by 2.7 cm from anterior\nto posterior. The anterior serosal surface is tan-pink smooth glistening and\ngrossly unremarkable. The posterior serosal surface is tan-pink dull and matted\nbut otherwise unremarkable. The right ovary is tan-white cribriform measuring 3\nx 1.1 x 1 cm and the right fimbriated fallopian tube is 8.5 x 0.5 cm tan-pink,\nslightly indurated and adhesed to the ovary. The left ovary is tan-white,\ncribriform measuring 2.5 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm with 2 firm white nodules measuring 0.4\ncm in greatest dimension and a left fimbriated fallopian tube that is 7 x 0.4 cm\ntan-pink rubbery and adhesed to the ovary. The cervix is 3.5 cm in length. The\ncervical face is ill-defined, tan-pink and roughened measuring approximately 2.5\nx 2 cm. The cervical os is stenotic. The uterus is opened along the right\nlateral wall to reveal a 2 x 0.7 cm, glistening, tan endocervical canal tan-pink\nand glistening leading into a triangular endometrial cavity measuring 3 x 2.7\ncm. The endometrium is tan-pink glistening with an average thickness of 0.1-0.2\ncm The myometrium has a well-circumscribed tan palpably firm area measuring 0.7\nx 0.7 x 0.3 cm on the superior anterior uterine wall. The remaining myometrium\nis tan, trabeculated and grossly unremarkable. Attached inferior to the uterus\nis a segment of pink smooth glistening vaginal mucosa measuring 9.3 x 6.5 cm.\nGross photographs are taken. Representative sections are submitted as follows: A l : Urethral margin\nA2: Right ureter margin\nA3: Left ureter margin\nA4-A5: First lesion on bladder dome and posterior wall, closest approach to\nblack ink\nA6-A7: Second lesion on superior -anterior wall\nA8: Small raised transparent nodular lesion superior to the trigone\nA9-Al 0: Representative sections of uninvolved bladder mucosa\nA 11-A 12: Representative sections of anterior endomyometrium (includes palpably\nfirm area) and cervix\nA13-A14: Representative sections of posterior endomyometrium and cervix\nA15: Representative sections of left ovary and fallopian tube\nA16: Representative sections of right ovary and fallopian tube\nB. The second container is additionally identified as, \"2. Right pelvic lymph\nnode\". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 5.5 x 5 x 2 cm aggregate of\nlobulated yellow fibrofatty tissue.

The epithelioid tumor cells are high grade, have modest\namphophilic cytoplasm and with brisk mitotic activity. In addition, numerous\nosteoclast-like giant cells are distributed all throughout the tumor. Foci of\ntumor necrosis are also present.\nImmunohistochemical stains performed show that the tumor cells are nuclear\npositive for GATA3 and with rare nuclear positivity for p63. Keratin Cam5.2, CK7\nand CK20 are negative. The positivity for GATA3 and p63 are supportive for\nurothelial carcinoma. Controls appropriate.\nRare occurrence of osteoclast-like giant cells rich carcinoma, similar to the\ncurrent case, has been reported in the urinary tract. The few cases previously\nreported showed an aggressive biologic behavior, see reference.\nOn part C, the right lymphadenectomy specimen shows large soft tissue deposits of carcinoma, which may represent overgrowths from a lymph nodal tumor\nmetastasis. No normal lymph node tissue however is identified. Of note, right\npelvic lymphadenectomy was performed previously (together with ureterectomy,\nwhich was negative for tumor. Nodal status for the current bladder tumor\nismost consistent with N 1.\nReference:\n1.Baydar D, Amin MB, Epstein JI. Osteoclast-rich undifferentiated carcinomas of\nthe urinary tract.

The first container is additionally identified as, \"Left pelvic lymph node\".\nReceived in formalin is an aggregate of yellow-tan ,soft, and lobulated tissue\nfragments ranging in size from 1.1-1.4 cm in greatest dimension. The specimen is\ndissected to reveal 10 lymph node candidates ranging in size from 0 .3-1.3 cm in\ngreatest dimension .The specimen is submitted as follows:\nA 1: 3 lymph node candidates\nA2: 2 lymph node candidates\nA3: 2 lymph node candidates\nA4: 2 lymph node candidates\nA5: 1 lymph node candidate\nA6: 1 lymph node candidate\nB. The second container is additionally identified as, \"bladder, prostate, left\nand right vas deferens\". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 250 g, 12.5\nx 7 x 6 cm cystoprostatectomy specimen consisting of a 8.5 x 6.5 x 3 cm bladder\nwith attached mesenteric fat and a detached 3.2 x 2 x 1.7 cm probable tumor (or prostate). The right seminal vesicles and right vas deferens are not clearly\nidentified and a structure resembling the right seminal vesicles measure 1.5 x\n1.5 x 0.4 cm and there is no identifiable right vas deferens structure. The\nleft vas deferens is not clearly identified and the left seminal vesicles\nmeasures 2.5x 1.5 x 0.4 cm and a structure resembling the left vas deferens\nmeasures 3 x 0.4 cm. The right ureteral stump measures 0.6 x 0.4 cm end\ndemonstrates an intact, patent lumen. The left ureteral stump is absent and the\nleft ureteral resection margin is taken where the ureter enters the bladder and\nis submitted as B3.\nThe right half of prostate and bladder is inked blue and the left half is inked\nblack. The bladder and prostate are opened anteriorly along the urethra. The\nfragments of the outer surface of the tumor fragment are white-brown and shaggy.\nSectioning demonstrates a diffuse, homogenous, ill-defined, firm, white-tan.\nThe opened bladder reveals a 1.8 x 1.2 x 0.3 cm raised, soft, red-pink lesion on\nthe anterior wall designated as lesion #1, a 4 x 1.8 x 0.3 cm raised, soft,\nred-pink lesion on the inferior posterior wall and right inferior lateral wall\ndesignated as lesion #2, a 2.5 x 2.5 cm left posterior wall hemorrhage, and a\n1.4 x 1 x 0.2 cm raised, soft, red-pink lesion on the mid left lateral wall\ndesignated as lesion #3. There is also an aggregate of firm, white-tan tumor\nfragments, free floating within the bladder lumen and measuring 11 x 5 x 3 cm.\nOn cut section, lesion #1 extends into the muscularis propria and grossly into\nthe perivesical tissue and is close to the deep margin. On cut section, lesion\n#2 does not extend beyond the mucosa, and lesion #3 does not extend beyond the\nmucosa and is 1.0 cm from the deep margin.\nThere is a 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm rubbery, white-tan, mass which is in the muscle\nlayer of the left lateral anterior wall and extending into the perivesicular\nadipose tissue.\nThe surrounding bladder mucosa is edematous, wrinkled, congested, pink-tan with\na uniform 0.1-0.2 cm wall thickness.

The first container is additionally identified as, \"peritoneal nodule\".\nReceived fresh for intraoperative diagnosis is a 2 .74g, 2.3 x 1.7 x 1.3 cm\nfragment of white rubbery tissue that is bisected to reveal a multicystic cut\nsurface consistent with ovary .One half of the specimen is frozen and read as\n\"ovarian tissue ,with benign cyst\". The frozen section remnant is submitted in\ncassette At FS. The remainder of the specimen is entirely submitted in cassette\nA2.\nB. The second container is additionally identified as, \"right ovary\". Received\nfresh and placed in formalin is a 4.8 x 1.2 x 0.5 cm tan-brown heavily\ncauterized rubbery tissue fragment. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal\nfatty fibrous tissue with no gross ovary identified. Specimen is entirely\nsubmitted in cassettes B 1-B4.\nC. The third container is additionally identified as, \"left ovary\". Received\nfresh and placed in formalin is a 7.56 g, 3.5 x 3 x 1.2 cm firm white-tan nodule\nwith adjacent fibrofatty tissue. The specimen is bivalved to reveal a uniform\nyellow-tan nodule within a 0.1 cm thick white-tan cyst wall. No gross ovarian\ntissue is identified. The specimen is entirely submitted in cassette C 1-C4.\nD. The fourth container is additionally identified as, \"bladder and urethra\".\nReceived fresh and placed in formalin is a 249.06g, 15 x 13 x 4.2 cm cystectomy\nspecimen with attached mesenteric fat and tubing in bladder. The bladder\nmeasures 7 x 6.5 x 3 cm. The urethral stump measures 3 cm in length by 1.1 cm\ndiameter and is probe patent. The right ureteral stump measures 4 cm in length\nby 0.6 cm in diameter which is discontinuous and disrupted by cautery midway\nthrough the length of the ureter. The right ureter probes patent but the orifice\nis involved by shaggy indurated mucosa. The left ureteral stump is discontinuous\nto suture and cautery at one segment measuring 1 cm in length by 0.6 cm in\ndiameter. The left ureteral orifice can't be identified at the trigone.\nAdditionally the bladder is remarkable for a 6 x 4.5 cm portion of mucosa\nattached to the posterior aspect of the urethra to the lower posterior aspect of\nthe bladder. The urethral margin is inked black.\nThe right half of the bladder is inked blue and the left half is inked black.\nThe bladder is opened along the right lateral aspect through the dome. The bladder demonstrates an indurated, ulcerated lesion in the lower\nanterior-left wall, left lateral wall and posterior wall at trigone. There is an\nill-defined 4.5 x 4 cm indurated area which contains a 3.5 x 3 cm ulceration\nsurrounded by a hemorrhagic rim of mucosa. Serial sectioning reveals that the\ntumor grossly infiltrates into the urethra located 2.8 cm from the urethral\nmargin and 0.8 cm from the mucosal surface. On cut section the tumor is\nwhite-tan firm, ill-defined extending a maximum depth of 1.8 cm (tumor max\ndimensions 4.5 x 4 x 1.8 cm) invading into adipose tissue which abuts the inked\nsurface (black). The remainder of the mucosa is tan-brown, edematous, and\nglistening with a uniform 0.8-1.3 cm wall thickness. Representative sections are\nsubmitted as follows:\nD 1: Urethral margin\nD2: Left ureteral margin\nD3: Right ureteral margin\nD4: Tumor relationship to urethra\nD5: Anterior wall tumor\nD6: Uninvolved anterior wall\nD7: Dome\nD8: Trigone with tumor (closest approach to inked margin)\nD9-D 10: Posterior wall with tumor, hemorrhage and extension to ink\nD 11: Right wall uninvolved with tumor\nD 12: Left wall with tumor\nD 13: Uninvolved left wall\nD 14-D 15: Additional representative sections of tumor\nD 16: Additional section of urethra\nE.

The third container is additionally identified as, \"bladder\". Received fresh\nand place in formalin is a 167.1 g cystectomy specimen with overall measurements\nof 15 x 13.3 x 2.8 cm. The right ureteral stump measures 3.5 cm in length and\n0.4 cm in diameter, and the left measures 1 cm in length and 0.4 cm in diameter.\nBoth ureters demonstrate intact patent lumens. The serosal surface shows yellow\nlobulated fibroadipose tissue with focal cautery artifact. The urethral margin\nis inked black, and the bladder is inked blue on the right side and black on the\nleft side. The specimen is opened anteriorly to reveal a 3.8 x 2.2 cm\nulcerated, necrotic mass on the right lateral wall and trigone. In addition\nthere is a 1.5 x 0.9 cm, superficial ulcerated lesion near the left trigone\nmeasuring 1.5 cm from the distal urethral margin. on cut section, the larger\nmass infiltrates into the muscularis propria to a depth of 1.1 cm and is 0.9 cm\nfrom the deep margin. The surrounding bladder mucosa is edematous, pink-tan\nwith a uniform 1.0 cm wall thickness. Bilateral ureteral orifices, adjacent to\nthe trigone, are identified and probe patent.\nRepresentative sections are submitted as follows:\nCl: Distal urethral margin\nC2: Right and left ureter resection margins (right inked blue)\nC3: Left lateral wall tumor, at maximum depth\nC4-C8: Additional sections of the ulcerative tumor\nc9-C10: ulcerated lesion on the right side near the trigone\nC11: uninvolved bladder mucosa bladder dome\nC12: uninvolved bladder mucosaanterior wall\nC13: uninvolved bladder mucosa, right lateral wall\nD.

        "llm_output": " Based on the pathology report, here is the information for the six categories:\n\nSite: The tumor is located in the breast. This is mentioned in the histological diagnosis as \"infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the breast.\"\n\nLaterality: The specific side of the body where the breast tumor is located is not provided in the report.\n\nHistology: The tumor is an invasive ductal carcinoma, which means it started in a milk duct and has spread into the surrounding breast tissue. This is indicated in the histological diagnosis as \"infiltrating ductal carcinoma.\"\n\nStage: The stage of the cancer is not explicitly stated in the report, but some information about the tumor size and lymph node involvement is provided. Based on this information, it appears that the tumor is at least stage II (T2 N1 M0), as it measures greater than 2 cm in diameter and has spread to at least one axillary lymph node.\n\nGrade: The grade of the cancer is not explicitly stated in the report, but some information about the tumor's appearance is provided. Based on this information, it appears that the tumor is high-grade (grade 3), as it is described as having a \"high nuclear grade\" and being composed of \"poorly differentiated cells.\"\n\nBehavior: The behavior of the cancer is not explicitly stated in the report, but the fact that it is an invasive ductal carcinoma indicates that it is malignant and capable of spreading to other parts of the body. This is further supported by the finding of lymph node metastasis.\n\nJustification: These categories were chosen because they are commonly used in cancer staging and provide important information about the tumor's location, size, spread, aggressiveness, and potential for metastasis."

It consists of an anterior pelvic exenteration\nspecimen .Overall, the specimen measures 37 x 16 x 4. 5 cm and on the posterior\nsurface has an attached smooth, glistening, mobile, pink-yellow peritoneum\nmeasuring 37 x 16 by less than 0.1 cm. The peritoneum doesnot appear to be\ninvolved by tumor. Thespecimen consists of a bladder (5 x 5 x 2.5 cm), attached\ngloboid uterus (7 x 5 x 1.8 cm), attached bilateral fallopian tubes (right 10 cm in\nlength and 0.4 cm in diameter, left 11 cm in length and 0.4 cm in diameter), and\nattached bilateral ovaries (right 2.2 x 1.3 x 0.8 cm, left 3.4 x 1 x 0.8 cm). The\nuterus and bladder are attached but freely mobile with regard to one another. The\nspecimen surgical resection margins are entirely inked black. The bladder is\nopened along the anterior wall, revealing a pliable uninvolved wall thickness of 1\ncm.The right and left ureterovesical junctions are identified and are probe\npatent. Both ureters are opened .The right attached ureter measures 5.5 cm in\nlength and 0.6 cm in circumference with normal, appearing mucosa. The left attached\nureter measures 4.5 cm in length and 0.7 cm circumference. Involving the left\nureterovesical junction, left'lateral wall, and left portions of the posterior wall\nand trigone is an ulcerated, exophytic, firm, gray-yellow, ill-defined tumor which\nmeasures 3.5 x 3 x 1.8 cm. Upon sectioning through the tumor, it extends through\nthe bladder wall and into the perivesical fat but does not involve the inked black\nresection margin or-the peritoneum. The tumor extends toa depth of 1.8 cm and is\n0.2 cm from the inked margin and the peritoneum. Cut surfaces of the tumor are\nsolid, firm, homogeneous, and white. The remainder of the bladder and ureteral\nmucosae are gray and wrinkled. No lymph nodes are grossly palpated in the.\nperivesical fat. The specimen is returned to the OR at the surgeon's request for\ngrossconsultation, at which time he is informed that tumor extends grossly through\nthe bladder wall with clear resection margins. The bladder and ureteral mucosae are\nthen fixed in B5 fixative for one hour and the specimen is subsequently entirely\nfixed in formalin for a prolonged period prior to taking sections for permanent\nprocessing. The serosa of the uterus is tan-pink, smooth and dull. The fallopian\ntubes and ovaries are grossly unremarkable. Upon sectioning through the ovaries,\nthe cut sections are white to yellow, solid, firm, and grossly unremarkable. The\nectocervix is covered by a shiny, pink-white mucosa. The ectocervix measures 3 x 2\ncm and has a flattened os measuring 1.3 x 0.1 cm. Surrounding the ectocervix is a\nrim of wrinkled, gray-pink vaginal mucosa measuring 0.3 cm wide that appears\ngrossly unremarkable. The uterus is bivalved revealing an endocervical canal\nmeasuring 2.5 cm in length that is lined by a smooth tan mucosa. The endometrial\ncavity measures 2.5 x 1.6 x 0.5 cm and is lined by a thin, soft, tan, uniform\nendometrium 0.1 cm thick.
