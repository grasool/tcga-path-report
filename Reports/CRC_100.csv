Microsatellite instability is not detected in the carcinoma by immunohistochemistry ;therefore ,the likelihood that the
carcinoma is due to sporadic or hereditary (i.e.: Lynch syndrome -associated )defective DNA mismatch repair is very low.
However ,immunohistochemistry may not detect rare polymorphisms or missense mutations in DNA mismatch repair proteins
in up to 10% of cases .If strong clinical suspicion persists, additional testing is suggested.
Archived slides and paraffin blocks were reviewed for case block Al0 containing normal tissue and carcinoma was selected for MSI analysis.
Irnmamohistochemical studies were performed on formalin fixed ,paraffin -embedded tissue with adequate positive and negative control sections, including internal
positive control tissue.
The performance characteristics of these antibodies were determined by the _
They have not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration .The FDA has
determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary .These tests are used for clinical purposes .They should not be regarded as investigational or for research.
This laboratory is certified under the Cli nical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA- 88) as qualified to perform high -complexity clinical laboratory
testing.

findings indicate an intact mismatch repair (MMR) gene function without evidence of significant microsatellite instability (MSI).
Although these findings make the diagnosis of hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer (HNPCC) or Lynch Syndrome very unlikely

SPECIMEN (S) SUBMITTED :GROSS DESCRIPTION
Right colon: In formalin labeled ""right colon"" is a 25 cm in length segment of cecum and right colon with an attached 20 cm of
terminal ileum and a 6 cm attached appendix. Within the right colon there is a 4.2 x 4 cm endophytic tumor with raised rolled
borders. This tumor is 9 cm from the distal margin and 24.5 cm from the proximal margin. The tumor invades into and through
the bowel wall into the pericolonic fat and is grossly 3 cm from the circumferential soft tissue margin. The tumor also appears to
near the serosa/peritonealized surface of the attached fat. There is an additional 4 x 3 cm polypoid mass 4.5 cm from the distal
margin and 29 cm from the proximal margin. The mucosa and wall adjacent to this mass is ragged, disrupted and hemorrhagic
with hemorrhage and necrosis in the surrounding pericoloic soft tissues. No gross invasion beyond the wall is noted and this
mass is 6 cm from the circumferential soft tissue margin. Within the cecum there is an additional 4.5 x 2.7 x 1.8 cm exophytic
polypoid mass. This mass is 17 cm from the distal margin and 22 cm from the proximal margin. Again, no invasion through the
wall is noted and the mass is 9 cm from the circumferential soft tissue margin. The remaining colonic mucosa is tan-pink with
several additional smaller, up to 0.6 cm, mucosal polyps and focal areas of congestion. The ileal mucosa is tan-pink with a few
polypoid projections and a 2.3 x 1.3 cm flat granular area 6 cm from the proximal margin and 27 cm from the distal margin. No
invasion into the mesenteric fat is noted and the lesion is 3.5 cm from the mesenteric resection margin. The cut surfaces of the
appendix display a lumen lined by congested mucosa. Multiple lymph nodes are identified in the attached fat. Representative
sections are submitted as labeled: A-C tumor in ascending colon to pericolonic fat and serosal/peritonealized surface; D-E distal
ascending colon polypoid mass with adjacent ragged hemorrhagic disrupted area; F-G cecal polypoid mass; H smaller colonic
mucosal polyps; I flat and granular irregular area in small bowel; J small bowel mucosa with small polypoid projections; K distal
margin and en face circumferential soft tissue margin; L proximal margin and appendix; M six lymph nodes; N six lymph nodes;
0 six lymph nodes; P six lymph nodes.

microscopic Exam ination
Microscopic examination is performed. Within part A, the fallopian tube
fimbria demonstrates a focal area of mild cytologic atypic.
Immunohistochemistry of this area (block Al) reveals weak/low cytokeratin 7,
p53 and Ki67 expression. Cytokeratin 20, Pax8 and CDX2 are negative. In
comparison, the tumor present in the colon demonstrates strong cytokeratin 20
and CDX2 expression and is negative for Pax8, p53, and cytokeratin 7. Ki6'7 is
moderately elevated. Overall, the findings in the fallopian tube are felt to
be secondary to cautery artifact. Dr. has reviewed parts of this case
and concurs with the interpretation.

Invasive poorly differentiated colonic adenocarcinoma with focal 
mucinous differentiation extending through the wall of the colon 
into the wall of the adhesed small bowel segment. 
Tumor also extends across the ileocecal valve into the terminal 
ileum. Proximal, distal and radial margins of resection are free 
of tumor. 
Fifteen mesenteric lymph nodes without evidence of metastatic 
carcinoma (0/15). 
Adhesed right fallopian tube and ovary without evidence of 
involvement by tumor. "," Site: Terminal ileum and right colon
Justification: The description mentions the resection of the terminal ileum and right colon.

Laterality: Not provided
Justification: The laterality (right, left, or bilateral) is not mentioned in the description.

Histology: Adenocarcinoma with focal mucinous differentiation
Justification: The description mentions the histologic type as adenocarcinoma with focal mucinous differentiation.

Stage: pT4, pN0, pMX (IIIB)
Justification: The primary tumor has extended through the wall of the colon into the adjacent small intestine (pT4), there is no evidence of metastatic carcinoma in 15 mesenteric lymph nodes (pN0), and distant metastasis cannot be assessed (pMX). This corresponds to stage IIIB based on the AJCC staging system.

Grade: Poorly differentiated
Justification: The description mentions that the adenocarcinoma is poorly differentiated.

Behavior: Malignant
Justification: The diagnosis of invasive colonic adenocarcinoma with focal mucinous differentiation indicates a malignant behavior.",,,,,,,

notable for a circumferential mass, with the bowel 12 em. in 
circumference in this region, with this mass 9 em. long and 
maximally 1.2 em. thick. Sectioning through the mass reveals the 
tumor to invade through the bowel wall into fat in the region with 
adherent omentum noted above, appearing to involve the omentum. The 
tumor comes very near to1 but does not clearly reach1 the outer

 GROSS DESCRIPTION 
             A.  Received fresh subsequently fixed in formalin labeled              ""sigmoid, upper rectum with adherent posterior bladder 
wall 
    and small intestines"".  The specimen consists of a rectosigmoid 
    colon with adherent portions of small bowel and possible portion of 
    bladder.  A segment of small bowel was 12 cm long, stapled at both     ends, which are arbitrarily inked blue and black.  A portion of 
    colon is 46 cm long.  Both ends are stapled, inked blue and the 
    opposite is opened and is inked black.  There is also a small 
    portion of possible bladder, which is 7 x 5 cm.  This is smooth to 
    slightly velvety and the margin of this is inked blue.  Orientation     cannot be determined.  One end away from the tumor is inked blue. 
    The opposite end close to the tumor is inked black.  The specimen 
is     opened to show a large fungating mass, which is 12 x 11.5 x 3.5 cm. 
    This comes within 2.5 cm of the black inked margin.  This tumor is     centrally necrotic and goes through the wall of the colon, into the 
    surrounding fat and through the wall of the small bowel into the 
    mucosa of the small bowel.  The remainder of the mucosa of small 
    bowel is pink- tan smooth glistening with normal slightly dilated 
    poles having an average circumference of 6.5 cm and the mucosal 
    alteration of tumor is 3.5 x 3.5 cm.  This comes within equidistant 
    luminal margins of the small bowel.  The tumor also comes through 
    the wall into the fat and possibly involves the mucosa of the 
    portion of bladder.  This is velvety, coming within 0.5 cm of the 
    nearest peripheral margin.  The remainder of the mucosa of the     specimen is pink- tan smooth glistening with an average 
circumference                                        of 9.5 cm.  The tumor comes within 1.5 cm of being circumferential 
    and shows a markedly necrotic central focus.  Lymph nodes are 
    grossly identified.  Representative sections of the specimen are     submitted as follows: 
 
    BLOCK SUMMARY:  1 - Representative luminal margins of small bowel, 
2     - representative section of small bowel tumor, 3- 4 - representative 
    section of bladder to tumor, 5 - representative luminal margins of 
    the colon, 6 - representative section of tumor to normal, 7 and 8 - 
    representative sections of tumor to fat, 9- 12 - have six possible

           B.  Received in formalin labelled ""appendix"" is a 6.3 x 0.7 
cm           appendix 
    which is partially covered with pink- tan smooth glistening serosa 
    and yellow 
    lobular fat.  The specimen is sectioned to show an intact wall with 
    an average thickness of 0.4 cm.  The lumen ranges from pinpoint to 
    0.4 cm and shows 
    possible diverticula present.  No other discrete gross lesions are 
    identified.  The entire specimen with the exception of the fat is     submitted in t settes.  AS- 2 (fat retained), proximal end 
    inked.  AS- 2.  
 
     
 
MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION 
    A. Microscopic exam of the resection shows: 
    Histologic type:  Adenocarcinoma, not otherwise specified 
     Histologic grade:  Moderately differentiated 
    Primary tumor(pT):  Tumor invades through the entire colonic wall     and through the entire adhesed small intestinal wall into the lumen 
     of the small intestine.  The tumor also invades into the 
muscularis 
     propria of the bladder wall (pT4b). 
     Proximal margin:  Negative for tumor.      Distal margin:  Negative for tumor. 
     Circumferential (radial) margin:  Negative for tumor although not 
     truly applicable given the resection of the adhered additional 
      organs. 
     Distance of tumor from closest margin:  2.5 from one of the colonic 
     margins 
     Vascular invasion:  Not identified. 
     Regional lymph nodes (pN): 30 lymph nodes are dissected from the 
     specimen and they are all negative for metastatic (pN0).      Non- lymph node pericolonic tumor:  Present in the soft tissue 
     adhesing the small intestine and the bladder to the upper       rectal/sigmoid colon resection.  No discrete additional nodules 
of 
      
 
 
   
  
 
  pericolonic tumor seen. 
     Distant metastasis (pM):  Cannot evaluate pMX. 
     Other findings:  There is significant necrosis of the tumor in the 
     central areas.              B. Microscopic examination of the appendix reveals a 
benign 
             mucocele at the tip.  No dysplasia or malignancy is 
    identified.  There is focal fibrous obliteration of the tip 
    including obliteration of the diverticulum. There is acute serositis 
    and ahdesions.

one 
    cassette.   
             B. eived fresh subsequently fixed in formalin labeled              ""sigmoid and upper rectum"".  The specimen grossly consists     of a 20- cm long portion of colon which is stapled at the distal end 
    (inked black) and opened at the proximal end (inked blue).  The     serosa of the specimen is pink- tan smooth and glistening partially 
    covered with abundant yellow lobular fat. Retroperitoneal reflection     is located 6 cm from the distal margin.  The specimen is opened to 
    show a pink- tan smooth glistening mucosa with an average 
    circumference of 5.5 cm.  There is a large exophytic tumor closer 
to 
    the distal end, measuring 5.3 x 6.0 x 1.0 cm.  This is located 3.5     cm from the distal end.  The distal end has a circumference of 7.5 
    cm and the tumor comes within 0.6 cm of being circumferential.  The 
    cut surface of the tumor shows invasion into the muscularis 
propria. 
    However, no discrete invasion is grossly identified into the fat.     This comes within 2.5 cm of the radial margin. A sample was taken 
    for tissure procurement.  The remainder of the mucosa is pink- tan 
    smooth and glistening with normal to slightly dilated folds.  No     other discrete gross lesions are identified in the mucosa. Multiple 
    lymph nodes are grossly identified in the fat which are firm and     somewhat enlarged up to 1.7 cm in greatest dimension. 
    Representative sections of the specimen are submitted as follows: 
    Block 1 - representative luminal margin; block 2- 4 - representative 
    section of tumor which includes tumor to normal and tumor into fat;     block 5 - representative radial margin; block 6 - one possible

             is a segment of bowel consisting of 6 cm of terminal ileum 
    with contiguous 23 cm of proximal colon.  The serosal surface is 
    glistening and tan- pink, and there is a moderate amount of attached 
    adipose tissue.  There is an unremarkable appendix present, 
    measuring 6.5 cm long x 0.7 cm in diameter.  On cut surface, it is 
    without focal lesion, without gross evidence of inflammation. The 
    bowel measures 3.6 cm and 8 cm in circumference at the proximal and 
    distal resection margins respectively.  The bowel is opened, and 
    there is a circumscribed 5.3 x 5 cm rubbery white- pink mass located 
    11 cm proximal to the distal margin.  A portion of tumor and of 
    normal tissue are submitted for tissue procurement per the clinical 
    requested.  On sectioning, the tumor has a maximum thickness of 1.6 
    cm, and grossly extends through the musuclaris propria and into 
    surrounding adipose tissue.  It is 1 cm from the outer surface of 
    the specimen.  The remainder of the bowel wall averages 0.5 cm thick 
    and has a tan- pink glistening mucosa with a normal pattern and 
    folds. The adipose tissue is dissected, and soft tan lymph nodes are 
    identified up to 1.8 cm in greatest dimension.  RS- 17, following

GROSS DESCRIPTION 
             Received fresh for tissue procurement labeled ""right 
             hemicolectomy with en bloc"" is a previously unopened, 24 cm 
    segment of proximal right colon with attached 17 cm of distal ileum 
    surfaced by smooth to scabrous tan- pink serosa with a moderate 
    amount of attached mesocolon, mesentery and unremarkable omentum. 
    An irregular 5 x 5 x 2.5 cm fragment of red- brown skeletal muscle is 
    present in the vicinity of the cecal pouch.  The cauterized surface 
    of the portion of abdominal wall is inked blue (representing true 
    surgical resection margin in that area).  A scant amount of adherent 
    omentum and retracted serosal surface are also present in the 
    vicinity of the attached portion of abdominal wall (subsequently 
    inked orange and representing the free radial serosal surface).  An 
    unremarkable 7.2 cm in length, 0.9 cm in diameter appendix is 
    present.  The proximal and distal margins measure 4 and 8 cm in 
    circumference respectively.  On opening, there is a nearly 
    circumferential rubbery tan- white tumor mass at the ileocecal valve 
    measuring 11.0 x 5.7 cm.  On sectioning, the tumor has a maximal 
    thickness of 2.8 cm, grossly extending into the muscularis to within 
    0.5 cm of the inked cauterized resection margin (abdominal wall) 
    (see paired contiguous sections blocks 2&3 and 4&5) and within 0.6 
    cm of the inked free radial serosal surface (see bisected contiguous 
    sections block 6 and 7).  The ileal and remaining colonic mucosa is 
    unremarkable glistening tan- pink with regular folds and the walls 
    average 0.4 cm in thickness.  Two palpable rubbery tan- pink-red 
    apical lymph nodes averaging 1.3 cm in greatest dimension are 
    recovered from the attached mesocolon.  Numerous additional rubbery 
    pale tan lymph nodes, 2.8 cm in greatest dimension, are recovered 
    from the remainder of the mesocolon and mesentery.  A portion of 
    tumor and a portion of normal mucosa are submitted for tissue 
    procurement as requeste  presentative sections are submitted in 
    25 blocks as labeled.  -

GROSS DESCRIPTION 
             A. Received fresh in a container labeled ""colon"" is a 
             segment of colon 23 cm long.  The specimen is received open 
    at both ends, which are arbitrarily inked blue and black.  The 
    serosal surface is tan- pink and glistening.  There is abundant 
    attached yellow adipose tissue.  There is also abundant omentum 
    present, 42 x 5 x 3 cm in greatest dimensions.  The omentum is 
    serially sectioned, and there are no focal lesions.  The segment of 
    bowel is opened.  It averages 6.5 cm in circumference.  5.5 cm from 
    the black- inked end of the specimen, there is a 5.5 x 5 x 3.8 cm 
    tumor mass.  On cut surface, this tumor grossly invades into, and 
    apparently through, the muscularis propria, into surrounding soft 
    tissues.  Although extending near to the serosal surface, tumor does 
    not appear to reach the serosal surface, and is not near the radial 
    margin.  The surface deep to the tumor is inked.  3.5 cm from the 
    blue- inked margin is a separate 3.5 x 3.3 x 2.7 cm polypoid lesion. 
    There is some black tattooing in this region.  On cut surface, the 
    polypoid lesion is exophytic, without definite gross invasion into 
    the bowel wall.  The specimen away from the lesions has a tan- pink 
    glistening mucosa and tan wall.  The adipose tissue is dissected, 
    and multiple tan lymph nodes are identified. RS- 22, following 
    fixation. 
 
    BLOCK SUMMARY:  A1,A2 - omentum; A3 - proximal and distal resection 
    margins; A4- A7 - invasive tumor mass, with one lymph node also 
    included in block A7; A8- A16 - entire polypoid lesion; A17- A22 - 
    lymph nodes. 
 
             B.  Received fresh in a container labeled ""B - small bowel 
             mass"" is a portion of tan tissue with mucosa along one 
    surface, 3 x 2 cm, and 0.3 cm deep, compatible with small bowel.  On 
    the serosal surface there is a tan- white plaque-l ike area, 0.8 x 0.5 
    x 0.1 cm.  A section is submitted for frozen section, including the 
    plaque- like area, and the remainder of the specimen is entirely 
    submitted for permanent sections in three additional blocks. 
             C.  Received in formalin in a container labeled ""appendix"" 
             is a 5.5 cm long x 0.7 cm in diameter appendix.  It is 
    grossly unremarkable, with a tan- pink glistening serosal surface, 
     wall, and tan mucosa.  There are no focal lesions.  AS- 1.

GROSS DESCRIPTION 
             A.  Received fresh in a container labeled ""sigmoid colon"" 
             is a 24 cm long segment of colon, which is received open at 
    one end, which is inked black black, and which is stapled at the 
    opposite end, which is inked blue.  It is 5 cm in circumference at 
    the open end of the specimen, and 9 cm in circumference at the 
    stapled end of the specimen.  The serosal surface is generally 
    tan- pink and glistening, with an area with tattoo pigmented 11 cm 
    from the open end of the specimen.  There is a palpable mass within 
    the bowel in this area, although there is not gross tumor 
    penetration to the serosal surface.  The specimen is opened, 
    revealing a near circumferential 7.5 x 6.5 x 1.5 cm mass lesion, 
    coming to within 4.5 cm of the open end of the specimen.  On cut 
    suface, there is invasion of tumor through the full thickness of the 
    bowel wall and into the surrounding adipose tissue, but the tumor is 
    not near the radial margin.  The mucosa away from this area is area 
    is tan- pink and glistening, with multiple polyps, ranging from 0.3 
    cm to 0.7 cm in greatest dimension.  There is no other worrisome 
    lesion in the bowel.  The adipose tissue is dissected, and multiple 
    soft tan- pink lymph nodes are identified.  RS- 16, according to the 
    accompanying block summary, following fixation. 
 
    BLOCK SUMMARY:  A1 - proximal and distal resection margins; A2- A6 - 
    polyps; A7 - radial margin; A8- A10 - tumor; A11- A15 - lymph nodes, 
    h multiple lymph nodes per block; A16 - one sectioned lymph node. 
     
 
             B.  Received fresh in a container labeled ""segment for 
             liver lesion"" is a wedge- shaped portion of tissue, with a 
    generally tan glistening capsular surface, but with an area of 
    tan- white discoloration on the capsular surface, and with the 
    non- capsular surface of the biopsy irregulary roughened and 
    cauterized.  The specimen spans an area 2 x 1.5 x 1.1 cm.  On cut 
    surface there is a nodular area approximately 0.6 cm in greatest 
    extent in the subcapsular region, corresponding to the discoloraton 
    noted on the capsular surface.  Two sections are submitted for 
    frozen section, with the apparent lesion in block BFS1, and the 
    remainder of the specimen is submitted for permanent sections one 
    additional block.

GROSS DESCRIPTION 
             Received fresh labeled ""right colon"" is a previously 
             unopened, 12 cm segment of proximal right colon with 
    attached 6 cm of distal ileum surfaced by smooth to scabrous 
    tan- pink serosa with a moderate amount of attached mesocolon, 
    mesentery and unremarkable omentum.  An unremarkable 6.6 cm appendix 
    averaging 0.5 cm in diameter is present.  The proximal and distal 
    margins measure 2.8 and 5 cm in circumference respectively.  On 
    opening, there is a nearly circumferential, 10.8 x 8 cm partially 
    necrotic dusky tan- gray-red tumor mass, 4 cm distal to the ileocecal 
    valve.  On sectioning, the tumor has a maximum thickness of 2.4 cm, 
    grossly extending into the muscularis to within 1.1 cm of the inked 
    free radial serosal surface.  The ileal and remaining colonic mucosa 
    is unremarkable, glistening tan- pink with regular folds and the 
    walls average 0.5 cm in thickness.  Several slightly rubbery pale 
    tan- white tissues in keeping with lymph nodes measuring up to 1.4 cm 
    in greatest dimension are recovered from the attached mesocolon and 
    mesentery.  Representative sections are submitted in 15 blocks as

           previously unopened and unoriented 35 cm. segment of colon 
    surfaced by smooth to slightly scabrous tan- pink serosa with a 
    copious amount of attached mesocolon and omentum. A  palpable area 
    of induration is noted.  The omentum overlying the area is focally 
    retracted and subsequently inked orange.  The pre- serosal surface in 
    the vicinity of the palpable mass is inked black.  The undesignated 
    margins measure 6.0 and 6.5 cm. in circumference respectively.  Upon 
    opening, there is a circumferential 10.5 x 9.5 cm. focally necrotic 
    glistening tan- pink tumor mass which is 9 cm. from the larger 
     circumference margin.  On sectioning, the tumor has a maximal 
    thickness of 2.4 cm. grossly extending through the muscularis to 
     within 0.15 cm. of the inked pre- serosal surface (block 4) and 
    adherent omentum (see blocks #2 and 3).  A portion of tumor and a 
    portion of normal mucosa are submitted for tissue procurement as 
    requested.  A pedunculated 1.2 x 0.8 x 0.6 cm. tan pink- red polyp is

GROSS DESCRIPTION
A.Received fresh, subsequently fixed in formalin, labeled
""sigmoid colon"". The specimen consists of a 22 cm. long
portion of colon which is stapled at the proximal end, opened at the
distal end. The proximal end is inked blue and the distal end is
inked black. The specimen is opened to show a pink tan smooth
glistening mucosa with normal to abundant folds. The circumference
of the proximal end is 4.5 cm. and the circumference at the distal
end is 7.5 cm. The specimen shows a 4.8 x 3.5 x 1 cm. tumor which
comes within 5 cm. of the distal margin. The serosa of the specimen
is pink tan smooth glistening and predominantly covered with yellow
lobular fat. The specimen shows a 2.5 x 1.5 cm. serosal
umbilication. This umbilication is inked blue. The tumor also shows
gross invasion through the muscularis propria into the fat. Multiple
lymph nodes are grossly identified in the surrounding fat. There is
a focus of mesenteric margin (peduncle) which feels somewhat
indurated. The proximal lymph node may be present in this area.
There is also a 1.5 x 1.5 irregular indurated focus on the surface
coming in within 9 cm. of the proximal margin. The cut surface of
this induration site shows possible tumor present. There is also a
small polyp grossly identified which is 0.5 cm. this is located 3
cm. from the distal margin. This polyp shows no invasion grossly
identified. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted
for tissue procurement. Representative sections of the remainder of
the specimen are submitted as follows:
BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 - Representative luminal margins; 2 - mesenteric
margin shave; 3 - polyp full thickness; 4 - tumor to serosal
umbilication; 5 - tumor to normal; 6 - tumor to fat; 7 - radial
margin; 8 - indurated surface nodule with possible tumor; 9-12 -
nine possible lymph nodes each; 13 - four possible lymph node; 14 -
lymph node at mesenteric peduncle bisected; 15 - rPnresentative
section of possible mottled lymph node. RS15
B.Received in formalin labeled ""appendix"" is a 6 x 0.5
cm.unremarkable appendix partially covered with pink tan
smooth glistening serosa and yellow lobular fat. The specimen is
sectioned to show an intact wall with an average thickness of 0.3
cm. The lumen ranges from pinpoint to 0.??. Representative sections
of the specimen are submitted in one cassette with the proximal end
inked. RS1
MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
Microscopic sections of the sigmoid tumor reveals a
moderate to poorly differentiated colonic adenocarcinoma
which has extended through the bowel wall into the mesenteric fat. The area of irregular indurated soft tissue at the mesenteric root
does not contain any carcinoma. There are three positive mesenteric
lymph nodes present. One of these is present at the mesenteric root
and represents the most proximal lymph node in the dissection.
There is a soft tissue metastasis present in the mesentery as well.
The results of the evaluation of the resection are summarized in the
following template.
Histologic type: Adenocarcinoma.
Histologic grade: Moderate to poorly differentiated.
Primary tumor (pT): Tumor invades through the colon wall into the
mesenteric fat (pT3).
Proximal margin: Negative.
Distal margin: Negative.
Circumferential (radial) margin: Negative.
Vascular invasion: Negative.
Regional lymph nodes (pN): Three of 41 mesenteric lymph nodes
contain metastatic adenocarcinoma (pNl).
Non-lymph node pericolonic tumor: Present.
Distant metastasis (pM): Tumor is present as a soft tissue
metastasis in the colonic mesentery (pMl).
Other findings: Adenomatous polyp. Appendix without significant
histopathologic findings.
DIAGNOSIS

CLINICAL NOTES
GROSS DESCRIPTION
A.Received fresh, then fixed in formalin, labeled
""sigmoid colon"", is an 18 cm. long portion of colon, opened
at one end (inked blue) and stapled at the opposite end (inked
black). The specimen is partially covered with pink-tan, smooth and
glistening serosa. Externally, there is a focus of adhesions, 4 x 3
cm., located 3.5 cm. from the nearest luminal margin (inked black).
The mucosa is pink-tan, smooth and glistening, with normal to
abundant folds, and average circumference of 6 cm. There is a 4 x
3.5 cm. ulcerated tumor, 3.5 cm. from the nearest luminal margin
(inked black), and contiguous with the focus of serosal adhesions.
This focus of adhesion is inked blue. The tumor shows gross
invasion into the muscularis propria, and appears to penetrate
through the fat, to within 0.3 cm. of the surgical margin of the
adhesion. The focus of the radial margin is grossly unremarkable.
The remainder of the mucosa is pink-tan, smooth and glistening, with
two polypoid lesions, 0.3 cm. in greatest dimension, located within
2 cm. of the black inked margin and 5.5 cm. of the blue inked
margin. These show no gross invasion. Lymph nodes are identified
in the fat. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted as
follows:
BLOCK SUMMARY: 1- Representative luminal margins; 2 - polyps, full
thickness; 3-5 - representative sections of tumor, including
representative to normal and representative to surgical margin; 6 -
six possible lymph nodes, with representative cross sections of

Transverse colon cancer with clinical obstruction Gross Description
Received fresh labeled ""right hemicolectomy"" is a previously unopened
40 cm segment of proximal right colon with attached 15 cm of distal
ileum and an abundant amount of attached mesocolon, mesentery, and
omentum. An unremarkable 9 cm appendix averaging 0.5 cm in diameter is
present. The proximal and distal margins measure 5.2 and 7.8 cm in
circumference respectively. On opening, there is a circumferential,
6.0 x 3.9 cm rubbery tan-white-red tumor mass which is 8 cm from the
distal margin. On sectioning, the tumor has a maximal thickness of 2
cm, grossly extending through the muscularis and into the attached
mesocolon. The tumor is present within 0.2 cm of the inked free radial
serosal surface and visually appears to extend into the attached
omentum. A 3 cm in greatest dimension area of tan red discoloration is
noted within the distal ileum, 5 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve.
The remaining ileal and colonic mucosa is unremarkable tan-pink with
regular folds and the walls average 0.5 cm. A portion of tumor and a
portion of normal colonic mucosa are submitted for tissue procurement
as requested. Multiple soft to slightly rubbery tan-pink tissues in
keeping with lymph nodes measuring up to 1.3 cm are recovered from the
attached mesocolon and mesentery. RS 21
