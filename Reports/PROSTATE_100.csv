(C) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES:
PROSTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA, GLEASON SCORE 7 (4+3) (SEE COMMENT).
TUMOR EXTENDING FOCALLY INTO EXTRAPROSTATIC TISSUE.
Margins of resection free of tumor.
Right and left seminal vesicles ,no tumor present.
Segments of right and left vasa deferentia ,no tumor present.
PERINEURAL INVASION PRESENT.
No lymphovascular invasion identified.
PROSTATIC INTRAEPITHELIAL NEOPLASIA (PIN), HIGH GRADE.
COMMENT
The prostate gland contains two foci of prostatic adenocarcinoma .Both tumor foci are located in the peripheral zone. The
dominant tumor focus is located in the left lateral ,left posterolateral and left posterior peripheral zone .This tumor focus measures.
1.8 x 1.2 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension, and it is present in the three cross sections of the prostate ,focally in the
apex and extensively in the base .In the left superior neurovascular bundle region ,this tumor focus extends focally (less than 2.0
mm) into extraprostatic tissue. The margins of resection are free of tumor .The second tumor focus is located in the right lateral
and right posterolateral peripheral zone .This tumor focus measures 1.1 x 0.3 cm in the largest cross -sectional dimension, and it
is present in the last cross section of the prostate and focally in the base .This tumor focus is of lower histologic grade and
confined to the prostate .Allmargins of resection are free of tumor.
GROSS DESCRIPTION
(C) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A specimen consisting of a prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles and
attached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.
The prostate gland (4.0 x 2.7 x 4.2 cm, 35. 0 grams ,post-fixation )has the usual shape. The soft tissue present along the
posterolateral aspects of the prostate is scant and symmetrical .An area of firmness is noted on the left base of the prostate.
Serial cross sections after fixation demonstrate an area consistent with tumor in the left side of the three cross sections of the
prostate.
The seminal vesicles and segments of vasa deferentia are grossly free of tumor.

NOTE: The urothelial carcinoma is composed of two components; one with morphologic features of 
small cell carcinoma and the other with glandular differentiation with mucinous features. The 
carcinomas seen in the urinary bladder and prostate are cyto-/ histomorphologically different and exhibit 
features consistent with their primary anatomic locations. The prostatic carcinoma is seen in four out of 
fifteen tissue sections (about 5-10% of the evaluated prostatic tissue). Dr. has seen representative 
slides of this case and agreed. Verbal report was given to Dr.

SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT
FINAL PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS
fIy
A.Anterior prostatic fat, biopsy :Benign vascular fibroadipose tissue ,no tumor, no
epithelium.
B.Posterior bladder margin ,biopsy :Prostatic adenocarcinoma ,Gleason score
4+4=8, in fibroadipose tissue ,nerve, ganglia and suspicious for lymphatic invasion.
C. Posterior peritoneum ,biopsy: Benign peritoneal tissue and fibroadipose tissue, no
tumor.
D. Right pelvic lymph nodes ,dissection :Two benign lymph nodes ,no tumor (0/2).
E.Left pelvic lymph nodes, dissection: No tumor in five lymph nodes (0/5).
F.Prostate gland ,bilateral seminal vesicles, prostatectomy :Prostatic
adenocarcinoma ,Gleason score 5+4 = 9, with florid extraprostatic extension and
bilateral seminal vesicle invasion ,at three different inked resection margins; see
comment.
COMMENT:
This case was amended onto add results of additional tissue submitted for part D. At the
request of the clinician ,the remainder of parts D and E were submitted to evaluate for the presence of
additional lymph nodes ,and one additional lymph node without tumor was identified .This is now
reflected in the gross description (allmaterial of parts D and E now submitted ,with additional blocks D2
and D3 ,and E2 ),and in the final diagnosis where and additional lymph node of part D is without tumor,
and in the comment where total number of lymph nodes present in changed from 6 to 7. No other
changes were made to this report.
The majority of the prostatic tissue (>85%) is involved by high-grade small acinar adenocarcinoma. PIA,Ti,S r NoIneAsta f (' ctrl `I tlrM01V
Only scant residual benign prostate is seen ,and while all of this appears atrophic suggestive of
preoperative hormone deprivation therapy ,the tumor shows recognizable areas of Gleason patterns 3, 4
and 5 tumor ,and therefore a grade is still reported .Three different margins have tumor at ink that are
all in areas of extraprostatic extension ;left anterior apex (at lest 3mm ,slides F4 ,F14), left posterior
quadrant along posterior seminal vesicle (scattered microscopic foci, slides F13 ,F20), and right bladder
resection margin (1mm slide F17). However ,extensive cautery artifact precludes the grading of the
carcinoma at these margins .In addition ,tumor is present in adipose tissue and nerve of the separate
specimen named ""posterior bladder margin "" (Slide BI ),but no tumor is seen in the smooth (detrusor)
muscle of this specimen .Extensive involvement of both the right and left seminal vesicles is also
observed ,as well as florid extraprostatic extension ,the largest contiguous of such being at least 2cm
(left Base).
Synoptic Comment for Prostate Tumors
- Type of tumor: Small acinar adenocarcinoma.
- Location of tumor: Throughout entire prostate, most extensive posteriorly, and on the left (right
anterior base apparently contains less tumor).
- Estimated volume of tumor :As tumor is almost completely replacing (at least 85%) this 40 gram
prostate, tumor volume is at least 30cc.
-Gleason score :5+4; primary pattern 5, secondary pattern 4.
-Estimated volume > Gleason pattern 3 :Greater than 90%.
-Involvement of capsule :Present, numerous areas.
- Extraprostatic extension :Present, extensive, multiple areas, largest contiguous area at least 2cm
(left base).
- Margin status for tumor :Positive (at least 3mm left anterior apex, slides F4, F14; left posterior
base, slides F13, F20 right bladder margin (slide F17). Gleason pattern at largest positive margin:
Grading is precluded by extensive cautery artifact, but appears high grade (4 or 5).
-Margin status for benign prostate glands :None present.
-High-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN ):Present; focally.
- Tumor involvement of seminal vesicle :Present; both sides.
-Perineural Infiltration :Present, extensive.
-Lymph node status :Negative; total number of nodes examined: 7.
- A3CC/UICC stage :pT3bNOR1 (If the patient did receive adequate/appropriate neoadjuvant ADT
course, the grade would be ypT3bNOR1; correlate with clinical history).

He now undergoes a robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy and bilateral
pelvic lymph node dissection.
Gross Description
The specimen is received in six parts, each labeled with the patient's name and medical record number.
Parts A-E are all received in formalin. Part F is received fresh.
Part A is additionally labeled ""anterior prostatic fat,"" and consists of two soft, irregular ,unoriented,
tan-yellow fibrofatty tissue fragments (4.5 x 3.7 x 0.6 cm in aggregate ).No nodules or masses are
palpated .Representative sections are submitted in cassette Al. Part B is additionally labeled ""posterior bladder margin ,""and consists of a single firm, unoriented,
tan-white tissue fragment (1.3 x1 x 0.4 cm ).The specimen is entirely submitted in cassette B1.
Part C is additionally labeled ""posterior peritoneum ,""and consists of a single soft, irregular, unoriented
tan-white to yellow -brown tissue fragment (3.1 x 1. 6 x 0.3 cm ).One side is smooth, shiny and

* Laterality is specified as right and left sides due to the presence of suspicious areas abutting or close to inked margins on both sides.
* Histology is assumed to be adenocarcinoma, which is the most common type of prostate cancer, based on the clinical history.
* Stage pT2c is assigned because the tumor appears to be organ-confined (no extension beyond the prostatic capsule) but involves both lobes (right and left).
* Grade 4-5 indicates a high-grade tumor, as mentioned in the clinical history.

DIAGNOSIS
(C) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES:
PROSTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA, GLEASON SCORE 9 (5+4) (SEE COMMENT).
MULTIFOCAL EXTRAPROSTATIC EXTENSION PRESENT.
TUMOR INVADING RIGHT AND LEFT SEMINAL VESICLES AND PERIVESICULAR SOFT TISSUE.
TUMOR EXTENDING IN MULTIPLE AREAS TO THE MARGIN OF RESECTION.
SEE PREVIOUS REPORT FOR DIAGNOSIS OF PELVIC LYMPH NODES.
COMMENT
Approximately 90% of the prostate gland is involved by prostatic adenocarcinoma. There are two tumor foci, one of peripheral
zone and one of transition zone origin. The dominant tumor focus is located in the right anterolateral, right lateral, right
posterolateral, right posterior, mid posterior, left posterior, left posterolateral, left lateral and left anterolateral peripheral zone with
extension into the transition zone. This tumor focus measures 4.0 x 3.0 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and it is
present in three cross sections and extensively in the apex and base regions. This tumor focus exhibits multifocal extraprostatic
extension and multifocal extension to the margin of resection. This tumor focus extensively invades both seminal vesicles
including intra and extraprostatic portions and perivesicular soft tissue. The second tumor focus is located in the right and left
transition zone. This tumor focus measures 2.0 x 1.0 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in three cross
sections, extensively in the apex and focally in the base region. This tumor focus is of lower histologic grade (Gleason score
6/3+3) and it is confined to the prostate.
Please refer to the previous report for the diagnosis of the pelvic lymph nodes.
GROSS :DESCRIPTION
(C) PROSTATE, SEMINAL VESICLES - A prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles and attached segments of right and
left vasa deferentia.
The prostate gland (5.3 x 3.5 x 3.6 cm, 56 gm, postfixation) has the usual shape. A nodule is palpated in the right mid and
right base regions. Serial cross sections after fixation demonstrate a firm area consistent with tumor in the right peripheral zone
involving the three cross sections of the prostate.
The seminal vesicles and segments of vasa deferentia are grossly free of tumor.

The specimen is inked as follows: Anterior-Orange, Posterior-Black, Apex-Red, Base-Blue, Right­
Green, and Left-Yellow. After removal of the apex and base, the remaining prostate weight is 29g. The 
specimen is serially sectioned from apex to base to reveal firm tan fibrous parenchyma. No obvious 
lesions or nodules are grossly identified. The attached right and left seminal vesicles are 2.5 x 1.5 x 
a.8cm and 3 x 2.5 x 1cm, respectively, are sectioned to beige tan cystic tissue with no gross evidence 
of tumor involvement. The attached right and left segments of vas deferens are 1.3 x a.6cm and 1.2 x

* Site: The site of the cancer is not explicitly mentioned in the report. However, it can be inferred to be the breast based on the context.
* Laterality: The laterality (left or right side) of the breast is also not provided in the report.
* Histology: The histology of the tumor is invasive ductal carcinoma, which means the cancer has developed from the milk ducts and has invaded the surrounding tissue.
* Stage: The stage of the cancer is T2N1M0, which indicates that the tumor is greater than 2 cm in size, has spread to at least one axillary lymph node, but has not yet metastasized to other parts of the body.
* Grade: The grade of the cancer is not provided in the report. However, it can be inferred that it is a high-grade tumor based on the fact that it has invaded the surrounding tissue.
* Behavior: The behavior of the cancer is malignant, meaning it is capable of spreading to other parts of the body and causing harm.

The reason for the discrepancy between pathology and radiology reports could be due to differences in interpretation or measurement of the tumor size, location, and involvement of lymph nodes. Without access to both reports, it is difficult to provide a definitive justification for the discrepancy."

COMMENT
Approximately 90% of the prostate is occupied by prostatic adenocarcinoma. The tumor measures approximately 4.0 x 3.0 cm in
the largest cross sectional dimension and it is present in the three cross sections of the prostate and extensively in the apex and
base regions. The tumor exhibits multifocal extraprostatic extension. The tumor invades both seminal vesicles including intra and
extraprostatic portions. In the base region, in the periurethral region, focal extension of tumor to the margin cannot be excluded.Additional sections were examined.
Please refer to the previous report for the diagnosis of the pelvic lymph nodes.
GROSS DESCRIPTION
(C) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A specimen consisting of a prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles andattached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.
The prostate gland (6.0 x 4.2 x 3.7 cm, 53 grams, post fixation) has the usual shape. The soft tissue present along the left
posterolateral aspect of the prostate appears more abundant than along the right side. The prostate is diffusely firm, particularlyon the left side including the left seminal vesicle.
SECTION CODE: C1-C3, right seminal vesicle and segment of right vas deferens from the base towards the tip; C4-C8,
left seminal vesicle and segment of left vas deferens from the base towards the tip; C9, C10, prostatic base, right border;
C11-C15, prostatic base, right posterior border; C16-C23, prostatic base, central portion; C24, prostaticbase , left border;C25-C27, prostatic base, left posterior border; C28-C30, apex anterior; C31, C32, apex left; C33-C37, apex posterior; C38-C40,
apex right; C41, C42, detached portions of margin of resection according to specimen radiograph; C43-C55, sections of the four
cross sections of the prostate according to specimen radiograph.
The anterior aspect of the prostate is inked in green, left surface in red, right surface in yellow and posterior surface inblack.Orange ink (C45-C47, C50, C54 and C55) denotes surfaces that do not represent the true margin of resection.

Justification: The tumor involves the right posterior and anterior portions of the prostate as well as the left apex.

Histology: Adenocarcinoma
Justification: The type of cancer is not specified in the provided information, but adenocarcinoma is the most common type of prostate cancer.

Stage: pT3a N0 MX
Justification: The pathological staging indicates that the tumor has invaded the periprostatic fat (pT3a), but there is no involvement of the seminal vesicles, bladder neck, or surgical margins. No lymph node metastasis was found (N0), and no distant metastasis was reported (MX).

Grade: Not provided
Justification: The Gleason score or any other grading system information is not available in the given pathology report.

Behavior: Malignant
Justification: Prostate cancer is a malignant tumor, which can invade and destroy surrounding tissues and potentially spread to other parts of the body."

COMMENT
The prostate gland contains a single focus of prostatic adenocarcinoma. The tumor is located in the right posterolateral, right
posterior, mid posterior, and left posterior peripheral zone. The tumor focus measures 2.5 x 0.9 cm in the largest cross-sectional
dimension, and it is present in the three cross sections of the prostate, extensively in the apex and focally in the base region. The
tumor is confined to the prostate. The margins of resection are free of tumor.
GROSS DESCRIPTION
(D) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A specimen consisting of a prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles and
attached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.
The prostate gland (5.2 x 2.5 x 3.8 cm, 36 grams, post-fixation) has the usual shape. The soft tissue present along the
posterolateral aspect of the prostate is abundant and more extensive along the right side. An area of firmness is noted on the
midline posterior surface of the prostate. Serial cross sections after fixation demonstrate an area of tumor in the mid posterior
region of the two cross sections of the prostate.
The seminal vesicles and segments of vasa deferentia are grossly free of tumor.
SECTION CODE: D1-D3, right seminal vesicle and segment of right vas deferens from the base towards the tip; D4, D5,
left seminal vesicle and segment of left vas deferens from the base towards the tip; D6, prostatic base right border; D7-D9,
prostatic base right posterior border; D10-D12, prostatic base central portion; D13, D14, prostatic base left border; D15, D16,
prostatic base left posterior border; D17, D18, apex anterior; D19, D20, apex left; D21, D22, apex posterior; D23, D24, apex right;
D25-D36, sections of the three cross sections of the prostate according to specimen radiograph.
The anterior aspect of the prostate is inked in green, left surface in red, right surface in yellow and posterior surface in
black. Blue ink (D7, 8, 10-12, 19-24, 27, 28, 32 and 36) and orange ink (D31) denote surfaces that do not represent a true margin
of resection. Two blocks (D25 and 29) submitted for decalcification.

Review of the electronic medical recordindicates the patient Is a'^ an
with a history of prostate cancer by core biopsy ,Gleason 's grade from 3+3 (6) to 3+4 (7). He now
undergoes a radical robot -assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy with bilateral pelvic lymph node
dissection.
Gross Description
The specimen is received in five parts ,each labeled with the patient 's name and medical record number.
Part A is received fresh, while Parts B-E are received in formalin.
Part A is additionally labeled ""prostate and seminal vesicles .""It consists of a large ,intact prostate
gland with attached seminal vesicle /vas deferens bundles ,weighing 44 gm and measuring 3.8 cm from
apex to base ,6 cm from medial to lateral ,and 3 .3 cm from anterior to posterior .The exterior of the
specimen Is roughened ,red-tan ,and glistening .A single line of small ,silver -gray laparoscopic staples
closes the dorsal vein complex .The bladder margin demonstrates extensive cautery markings. The
seminal vesicle /vas deferens bundles are small, soft ,and whorled ,without obvious mass or lesion. The
right anterior and lateral aspect of the mid gland through base is somewhat soft to palpation .The left
lateral aspect from apex through mid gland is firm to palpation .The right anterior surface of the gland
is inked in green ,the left anterior surface is inked in blue ,and the posterior surface is Inked In black.
The specimen Is then partially bisected at the mid gland ,perpendicular to the urethral channel, and
fresh tissue is banked from the left posterior aspect of the apex through mid gland for tissue
banking /research purposes .The incision Is then glued shut ,and the specimen is fixed prior to further
sectioning .Following formalin fixation ,the bladder margin is removed ,and the remainder of the gland
is serially sectioned ,from apex to base ,perpendicular to the urethral channel ,Into seven serial slices.
The serial slices reveal a large ,solid, white ,lobular mass dominating the left central and peripheral
zones ,noted in the apical margin through serial slice 4 .The tumor continues along the posterior aspect
into serial slice 7 .This lesion measures 3 cm In greatest dimension and grossly abuts the anterior,
lateral ,and posterior prostatic capsule in serial slices 1 -4.The left anterior lateral and posterior aspect
of the left lobe is dominated by an area of polycystic tissue. The apical and bladder margins as well as
representative sections of the prostate and seminal vesicles are submitted as follows:

COMMENT: Review of the frozen material shows no evidence of carcinoma. However,
multiple additional blocks of the fatty portion of the left iliac lymph node were
submitted for permanent section review (which not amenable to frozen section
because of the fatty nature). One of these blocks shows small fragments of node
(with extensive fatty-replacement) to have a micrometastasis (0.8 mm). Of note, a
recent large study indicates that frozen section sensitivity for micrometastases, < 5

extend 4 .8 x 4.8 x 0.9 cm and the vas deferens 1.2 x 0 .6 cm. The radial margin of the prostate is shaggy,
deep red and is now differentially inked as follows:
Right anterior -lateral: Blue,
Left anterior -lateral :Orange,
Posterior. Black.
Initial sectioning through the bilateral seminal vesicles demonstrate soft to rubbery ,light pink and tan,
honeycomb cut surfaces without gross tumor involvement .The bilateral seminal vesicles and vas deferens
are now trimmed and the prostate is serially sectioned apex to base revealing a partially demarcated,
dense ,glossy ,light pink and tan to focally yellow -orange tumor mass in the left body of the prostate
measuring upwards of 3.3 x 3.2 x 2.2 cm. The tumor mass grossly approaches 0.2 cm of the left apex and
0..1cm of the left base. The tumor mass grossly approaches within 0.2 cm of the nearest left radial surgical
margin .Representative portions of the tumor ,para -neoplastic, normal parenchyma are submitted for
studies.
The remaining cut sections of the right body of prostate demonstrates multiple circumscribed, light tan
nodularities near the urethral tract. The right posterior periphery of the prostate near the transition
zone-origin of seminal vesicles demonstrates diffuse and well-demarcated, glossy density within 0.2 cm of
the posterior surgical margin suspicious for malignancy (Al 3), Representative sections are submitted for
microscopic evaluation in a sequential fashion apex towards base.

COMMENT
The prostate glands three separate foci of prostatic adenocarcinoma ,one in the transition zone and two in the peripheral zone.
The dominant tumor focus is located in the right and left transition zone with extension into the left peripheral zone .This tumor
focus measures 2.5 x 1 .5 cm in the largest cross -sectional dimension and it is present in the four cross sections of the prostate,
extensively in the apex and focally in the base region .This tumor focus exhibits extraprostatic extension in the anterior apical
region and right anterior prostatic surface .Extraprostatic extension is present in two sections and the added length of
extraprostatic tumor is less than 2.0 mm .In the anterior apical region ,focal extension of tumor the tumor inked margin cannot be
excluded .Itshould be noted that the final margin of resection is represented by the separately submitted specimen B and it is free
of tumor .The second tumor focus is located in the left posterior peripheral zone .This tumor focus measures 0.4 x 0 .2 cm in the
largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in one cross section and focally in the apical region. The third tumor focus is
located in the right posterolateral peripheral zone .This tumor focus measures 0.2 x 0.1 cm in the largest cross-sectional
dimension and it is present in one cross section. The nondominant tumor foci are of lower histologic grade and are confined to the
prostate with negative margins.

Justification: The clinical diagnosis and description of the specimen indicate that the tumor originated in the prostate gland.

Laterality: Not provided
Justification: The document does not mention any laterality information about the tumor.

Histology: Adenocarcinoma
Justification: The clinical diagnosis suggests a malignant neoplasm of the prostate, which is consistent with adenocarcinoma, the most common type of prostate cancer. However, the exact histological subtype is not specified in the given information.

Stage: pT2 (organ-confined)
Justification: The surgical margins are negative, and there is no gross or microscopic evidence of tumor involvement in the seminal vesicles or lymph nodes. This suggests that the cancer has not spread beyond the prostate gland, indicating an organ-confined stage (pT2).

Grade: Not provided
Justification: The document does not include any information about the grade of the tumor, such as Gleason score or other grading systems.

Clinical History
The patient is a year-old man with prostate cancer, Gleason grade 3+3.
Gross Description
The specimen is received fresh in one part, labeled with the patient's name and medical record number
and ""prostate and seminal vesicles, left ampulla single short stitch; right seminal vesicle single long."" It
consists of three separate pieces of tissue. One is the prostate gland, the second is the left ampulla (as
designated by the surgeon with a single short stitch), and the third piece Is the right seminal vesicle (as
designated by the surgeon with a single long stitch). The prostate will be described first. The prostate
gland measures 4 cm from apex to base, 6 cm from medial to lateral, and 4 cm from anterior to
posterior. The exterior of the gland Is roughened and pink-tan. Focal cautery markings are seen along
the base/bladder margin. Sutures are present along the anterior midline. Tiny metal staples are also
found embedded. There is a left seminal vesicle/vas deferens bundle attached, measuring 1.7 x 2 x 0.6
cm. The right seminal vesicle/vas deferens bundle is not attached; as noted by the surgeon, they were
detached intraoperatively and will be described below. The left seminal vesicle/vas deferens bundle Is
soft, pink-tan, and whorled and has no discrete lesions. The right anterior surface of the gland Is inked
In green, the left anterior surface Is inked in blue, and the posterior surface is inked in black. The
specimen Is bisected roughly perpendicular to the urethral channel, and two fresh 6-mm punch biopsies
are taken for research purposes. The two halves of the specimen are then glued, and the prostate is
fixed prior to further sectioning. Following fixation, the apical and bladder margins are removed, and
the remainder of the gland is serially sectioned, from apex to base, into three serial slices. The serial
slices reveal central and transitional zones composed of firm, slightly lobulated, pink-tan, and partially
cystic tissue surrounded by firmer, white-tan, striated tissue. The periphery is composed of a thinner
rim of softer, semi-porous, light tan tissue along the posterior surface. One suspicious lesion Is seen in
the right half of serial slices 1 and 2 and 3. This suspicious lesion is firm yellow-tan, and irregular and
measures 0.7 cm in greatest dimension. Following further dissection and submission of tissue for
pathologic evaluation, serial slice 3 is taken for tissue banking/research purposes.
The second piece of tissue, which the surgeon designates as left ampulla with a single short stitch, is
firm, irregular, and pink-tan, weighs 1 gm, and measures 2 x 1 x 0.5 cm. The external surface of the
left ampulla is inked blue. It is bisected and entirely submitted (cassette A20).
The third piece of tissue, which the surgeon designates as right seminal vesicle with a single long stitch,
weighs 2 gm and measures 2.7 x 1.7 x 1 cm. It is firm, Irregular, and pink-tan. The external surface of
the right seminal vesicle is inked black. It is bisected longitudinally, revealing no lesions. A
representative section of the right seminal vesicle is submitted (cassette A21).
The apical and bladder margins as well as representative sections of prostate and seminal vesicles are
submitted as follows:

COMMENT
The prostate gland contains a single focus of prostatic adenocarcinoma. The tumor is located in the right lateral, right
posterolateral, right posterior, mid posterior, left posterior, left posterolateral and left lateral peripheral zone. The tumor focus
measures 3.0 x 1.4 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension, and it is present in the two cross sections of the prostate and
extensively in the apex and base regions. The tumor exhibits extensive, multifocal extraprostatic extension. Areas of
extraprostatic extension include the right and left posterolateral surface of the prostate, right and left posterior surface of the
prostate, right and posterior apex, base region anterior to the left seminal vesicle and left superior neurovascular bundle. On the
left superior neurovascular bundle, at the site of extraprostatic extension, tumor is present at the inked margin of resection. The
extent of marginal involvement in this region is less than 1.0 mm. In other regions, carcinoma is present at less than 0.1 mm from
the inked margin of resection (posterior apex and bladder neck region). The tumor invades both seminal vesicles including
extraprostatic portion of the right and left seminal vesicles, and intraprostatic portion of the left seminal vesicle. Involvement of
perivesicular soft tissue is also present.
Please refer to the previous report for the diagnosis of the pelvic lymph nodes.
GROSS. DESCRIPTION

The specimen is inked as follows: Anterior-Orange, Posterior-Black, Apex-Red, Base-Blue, Right­
Green, and Left-Yellow. Afterremoval of the apex and base, the remaining prostate weight is 22. The 
specimen is serially sectioned from apex to base to reveal firm tan fibrous parenchyma. No obvious 
lesions or nodules are grossly identified. The attached right and left seminal vesicles are 4 x 1.5 x 
0.8cm and 3.5 x 2.5 x 1cm, respectively, are sectioned to beige tan cystic tissue with no gross evidence 
of tumor involvement. The attached right and left segments of vas deferens are 1 x 0.6cm and 1.2 x 
0.6m, respectively, are sectioned to reveal firm tan tubular structure with no gross evidence of tumor 
involvement. A portion of the specimen is submitted for tissue procurement (Level II). The remainder is

COMMENT
The prostate gland contains two foci of prostatic adenocarcinoma, one in the peripheral zone and one in the transition zone. The
dominant tumor focus is located in the left anterolateral, left lateral and left posterolateral peripheral zone with extension into the
left transition zone. This tumor focus measures 2.0 x 0.8 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in the two
cross-sections of the prostate and extensively in the apex and base. In the left superior neurovascular bundle region this tumor
focus extends into extraprostatic tissue (6.0 mm). The margins of resection are free of tumor. The second tumor focus is located
in the right transition zone. This tumor focus measures 1.4 x 1.2 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and is present in two
cross-sections and extensively in the apex and base. This tumor focus is of lower histologic grade (Gleason score 7/3+4) and
confined to the prostate. The margins of resection are free of tumor.
Please refer to the previous report for the diagnosis of the pelvic lymph nodes.

2.High grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN ),extensive.
3.Right and left seminal vesicles without tumor.
COMMENT:
No extraprostatic tumor is seen by direct extension beyond the prostate ,but a cluster of crowded cells
with amphophilic vacuolated cytoplasm and enlarged nuclei with prominent nucleoli is present within a
lymphovascular space outside of the prostate gland (slide A22 ).Immunohistochemical stains were
performed to rule out benign periprostatic glands and these cells stain positively with prostate specific
antigen (PSA), without p63, ck903 or PAX2 staining ,supporting that these are prostatic
adenocarcinoma In a vascular space .According to Inquiry made to the UICC /AJCC TNM helpdesk for
tumor staging ,this finding does not constitute true extraprostatic extension ,and should best be
classified as lymphatic space invasion and denoted by Li in the TNM stage report.
Synoptic Comment for Prostate Tumors
- Type of tumor :Small acinar adenocarcinoma.
Location of tumor :Large left sided (posterior and anterior) mid gland tumor (4.8 cc, slides E5, E6,

secondary resection of the right ductus, the surgical margin right lateral , the secondary resection of
Dennonvillier's fascia, apex and secondary resection of surgical margin of urethra.
*immunohistochemical analyses (D2-40, CD31) on tissue blocks SBR1 and SBLI revealed no
lymphatic or venous invasion. However, due to the lymph node metastases earlier lymphatic invasion
has to be assumed.

Remark 
Tumor classification: pDa pNO (0/8); LO, YO, Gleason 3+4 = 7 (Gleason 4: 10%), complete local 
resection. "," 1. ""Site"": Prostate. Justified as the report clearly specifies the tumor location as the prostate.
2. ""Laterality"": Left. Justified as the report mentions the spread of the tumor in the left prostate lobe and infiltration of the left-sided perivesicular fatty tissue.
3. ""Histology"": Predominantly moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Justified as the report clearly states the histological type of the tumor.
4. ""Stage"": T2N0Mx. Justified as the tumor has spread in the prostate but not beyond the prostatic capsule (T2) and no metastasis to distant organs (M0), lymph nodes are free of tumor (N0).
5. ""Grade"": Grade III (High grade or poorly differentiated). However, based on the report, it's mentioned as moderately differentiated which typically corresponds to Grade II. The reporting pathologist might have used a different grading system, so without additional context, it's difficult to assign a precise grade.
6. ""Behavior"": Malignant. Justified as the tumor shows invasion of the surrounding tissues (left-sided perivesicular fatty tissue)."

Et"," Based on the additional sections provided, here is the patient summary using the six categories:

Site: The site of the cancer is not explicitly mentioned in the given text, but it can be inferred that it is related to lymph nodes (Sections 17-19) and possibly associated with a mirror image tissue (Section 17).

Laterality: Not provided. There is no information about the laterality of the cancer in the given text.

Histology: The histological type of the cancer is not explicitly mentioned, but it may involve some form of carcinoma based on the use of immunohistochemistry tests (Section 16).

Stage: Not provided. There is no information about the stage of the cancer in the given text.

Grade: Not provided. There is no information about the grade of the cancer in the given text.

Behavior: The biological behavior of the cancer is not explicitly mentioned, but it can be inferred to be malignant based on the context and use of terms like ""carcinoma"" and ""discrepancy.""

Justification for choice: These six categories are commonly used in cancer reporting and provide essential information about the cancer's location, severity, and characteristics. However, due to limited information provided in the given text, many categories are marked as ""not provided."""

Gross Description:
Received are three formalin filled containers all labeled with the patient's
name
Part A is received additionally labeled ""prostate and seminal vesicles."" The
specimen consists of a prostate gland with attached bilateral seminal vesicles
and segments of vas deferens. The specimen is inked in the following manner:
right side yellow, left side black, posterior aspect over-inked in red. The
remaining gland has a weight of 42 g, and a length of 3.3 cm with additional
dimensions of 5.4 x 3.8 cm. The apex and base prostatic margins of surgical
resection are coned and submitted in cassettes A1-2, respectively. The remaining
gland is step-sectioned in an apex to base manner with sections submitted as
follows:
A3-11 right posterior prostate gland apex to base manner;
Al 2-20 left posterior prostate gland apex to base manner;
A21 right anterior prostate gland level 2;
A22 left anterior prostate gland level 3;
A23 right anterior prostate gland level 4;
A24 left anterior prostate gland level 6;
A25 right anterior prostate gland level 6;
A26 left anterior prostate gland level 7;
A27 right anterior prostate gland level 8;
A28-29 right and left prostate gland approaching interface with seminal
vesicles, respectively;
A30-32 right seminal vesicle and segment of vas in a base, mid to apex
manner;
A33-35 left seminal vesicle and vas in a base, mid to apex manner.
Part B is received additionally labeled ""right pelvic nodes"" and consists of yellow, lobulated, fibrofatty tissues having aggregate dimensions of 5.5 x 3.5
cm by up to 1 cm. These tissues are placed in a ""clearing agent"" and a
subsequent search reveals six probable lymph nodes that range from 0.5 to 3.5 cm
in greatest dimension. The lymph node candidates are submitted as follows:
B1 four whole probable lymph nodes;
B2 one whole lymph node bisected;
B3-4 one whole lymph node quadrisected, one-half in each cassette.
Part C is received additionally labeled ""left pelvic nodes"" and consists of
yellow, lobulated, fibrofatty tissues having aggregate dimensions of 7 x 5.5 x 1
cm. These tissues are placed in a ""clearing agent' and a subsequent search
reveals six probable lymph nodes that range from 0.5 to 3 cm in greatest
dimension. These lymph node candidates are submitted as follows:
C1 two whole probable lymph nodes;
C2 two whole probable lymph nodes;
C3 one whole probable lymph node;
C4-5 one whole lymph node bisected, one-half in each cassette.

COMMENT
The prostate gland contains three foci of prostatic adenocarcinoma ,one in the transition zone and two in the peripheral zone. The
dominant tumor focus and the one of the highest histologic grade is located in the right and left transition zone. This tumor focus
measures 3.0 x 1.5 cm in the largest cross -sectional dimension, and it is present in four cross sections and extensively in the
apical region .This tumor focus exhibits predominately Gleason grades 4 and 3. A minor (tertiary )component of Gleason grade 5
is also present. This tumor exhibits focal extraprostatic extension (less than 1 .0 mm) in the right anterior surface of the prostate
and extends to the margin of resection in the anterior apical region. The extent of marginal involvement is 6.0 mm .The two
peripheral zone foci are located in the left posterolateral and right lateral peripheral zone. The tumor located in the left
posterolateral peripheral zone measures 0.8 x 0 .4 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension, and it is present in the first cross
section of the prostate .The third tumor focus is located in the right lateral peripheral zone. This tumor measures 0.5 x 0.2 cm in
the largest cross-sectional dimension ,and it is present in one cross section. The non-dominant tumor foci are of lower histologic
grade (Gleason score 6/3 + 3) and are confined to the prostate with negative margins.
GROSS DESCRIPTION
(A) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A specimen consisting of a prostate ,attached right and left seminal vesicles and
attached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.
The prostate gland (2.5 x 2. 2 x 4.0 cm ,31 grams ,post fixation )has the usual shape .The soft tissue present along the
right and left posterolateral aspects of the prostate appears symmetrical .A palpable and visible nodule is observed in the left mid
region of the prostate .Serial cross sections after fixation demonstrate firm areas consistent with tumor in the right transition zone
and right peripheral zone of the first three of the four cross sections of the prostate.
The seminal vesicles and segments of vasa deferentia are grossly free of tumor.

COMMENT
The prostate gland contains two separate foci of prostatic adenocarcinoma, one in the transition zone and one in the peripheral
zone. The largest tumor focus although not the one of the highest histologic grade (Gleason score 5/3+2) located in the right and
left transition zone. This tumor focus measures 2.7 x 1.3 cm in the largest cross sectional dimension and it is present in four cross
sections and focally in the apical region. This tumor focus is confined to the prostate and the margins of resection are free of
tumor. The second tumor focus is located in the left lateral, left posterolateral, left posterior, mid posterior and right posterior
peripheral zone. This tumor focus measures 2.2 x 1.5 cm in the largest cross sectional dimension and it is present in three cross
sections, extensively in the apex and focally in the base region. This tumor focus is a high grade carcinoma (Gleason score 4+5)
and is associated with an increased lymphocytic infiltrate. The tumor focus exhibits extraprostatic extension in the left apex and left
posterolateral aspect of the prostate. Extraprostatic extension is present in two separate sections and the added length of
extraprostatic tumor is 9.0 mm. At the site of extraprostatic extension the margins of resection are free of tumor. This tumor focus
focally extends to less than 0.1 mm from the margin of resection in the apex. This tumor focus invades the intraprostatic portion of
the left seminal vesicle.
Due to the presence of distortion in areas of the tumor close to the margins of resection in the apex and the presence of a marked
lymphocytic infiltrate, immunoperoxidase studies for keratin, lymphocyte marker and neuroendocrine differentiation markers were
performed. Cytokeratin highlights tumor which is seen focally approaching but not at the margins of r section. The lymphocytic
infiltrate is a mixture of both CD20 positive B lymphocytes and CD5 positive T lymphocytes with a pr dominance of the latter. The
tumor is negative for synaptophysin but a few scattered neoplastic cells are positive for chromograni supporting the presence of
focal minimal neuroendocrine differentiation. Page: 4
(D) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A specimen consisting of a prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles and
attached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.
The prostate gland (4.5 x 2.5 x 4.5 cm, 40 grams, post-fixation) has the usual shape. The soft tissue present along the
right and left posterolateral aspects of the prostate appears symmetrical. A nodule is palpated on the left posterolateral aspect of
the prostate include the left apex and left mid region. Serial cross sections after fixation demonstrate firm area consistent with
tumor in the left peripheral zone extending from the first to the third cross sections of the prostate.
The seminal vesicles and segments of vasa deferentia are grossly free of tumor.
SECTION CODE: D1-D3, right seminal vesicle and segment of right vas deferens from the base towards the tip; D4-D6,
left seminal vesicle and segment of left vas deferens from the base towards the tip; D7, prostatic base right border; D8, D9,
prostatic base right posterior border; D10-D15, prostatic base central portion; D16, prostatic base left border; D17, D18, prostatic
base left posterior border; D19, apex anterior; D20-D22, apex left; D23-D25, apex posterior; D26, D27, apex right; D28-D43,
sections of four cross sections of the prostate according to specimen radiograph.
The anterior aspect of the prostate is inked in green, left surface in red, right surface in yellow and posterior surface in
black.Blue ink (D20-22, D28 and D32) denote surfaces which do not represent the true margins of resection.

u QUD__"," Site: Prostate and seminal vesicles
Justification: The pathology report clearly indicates that the prostatic adenocarcinoma is located in the prostate and seminal vesicles.

Laterality: Not provided
Justification: The report does not mention any laterality information related to the primary tumor.

Histology: Adenocarcinoma
Justification: The report consistently refers to the malignancy as ""prostatic adenocarcinoma.""

Stage: Not provided
Justification: The report does not contain enough information to accurately determine the stage of the prostatic adenocarcinoma.

Grade: High grade (Gleason score 4+5)
Justification: The report mentions that one tumor focus is a high-grade carcinoma with a Gleason score of 4+5.

Behavior: Malignant
Justification: The diagnosis of prostatic adenocarcinoma inherently indicates malignant behavior, as it is an uncontrolled growth of cancerous cells that can invade surrounding tissues and metastasize to other parts of the body."

SURGICAL PATH OLOGY REPORT
FINAL PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS
A. Prostate gland, bilateral seminal vesicles, radical prostatectomy:
1.Prostatic adenocarcinoma, Gleason grade 5+4 = 9, with extensive extraprostatic
extension and left seminal vesicle invasion, excised; see comment.
2.Right seminal vesicle, no tumor.
3.High-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, focal.
B.Lymph nodes ,right pelvic, dissection :No tumor in three lymph nodes (0/3).
C. Lymph nodes,, left pelvic, dissection: No tumor in three lymph nodes (0/3).
COMMENT:
The majority of the tumor is composed of solid sheets of tumor cells with large vacuoles that give the
impression of gland formation however ,these are signet -ring like cells and therefore this is consistent
with Gleason pattern 5. Some areas are suspicious for lymphatic invasion.

COMMENT
The prostate gland contains two foci of prostatic adenocarcinoma. Both tumor foci are located in the peripheral zone. The
dominant tumor focus is located in the left lateral, left posterolateral, left posterior, mid-posterior, right posterior, right posterolateral
and right lateral peripheral zone. This tumor focus measures 3.8 x 1.8 cm in largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in
the two cross-sections of the prostate and extensively in the apex and base. The tumor exhibits extraprostatic extension on the left
posterolateral surface of the prostate and right and left superior neurovascular bundle regions. The tumor extends to the right
bladder neck margin of resection. The area of the positive margin is cauterized and the added length of the cauterized margin on
the right base is 4.0 mm. The second tumor focus is located in the right anterolateral and right lateral peripheral zone. This tumor
focus measures less than 0.1 x less than 0.1 cm in largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in the first cross-section and
focally in the apex. The non-dominant tumor focus is of lower histologic grade and confined to the prostate with negative margins.
GROSS .DESCRIPTION
(E) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A specimen consisting of a prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles and
attached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.
The prostate gland (5.0 x 2.5 x 4.0 cm, 28.0 grams, post-fixation) has the usual shape. The soft tissue present along the
left posterolateral aspect of the prostate appears more abundant than along the right side. A palpable nodule is present on the left
mid and base regions of the prostate. Serial cross-sections after fixation demonstrate an area consistent with tumor in the rightand left sides of the two cross-sections of the prostate.
The seminal vesicles and segments of vasa deferentia are grossly free of tumor.

Justification: Clearly stated in the clinical history and confirmed by the gross description.

Laterality: Not provided
Justification: The report mentions tumor foci in both the left and right sides of the prostate, but does not explicitly provide information on laterality for the overall diagnosis.

Histology: Prostatic adenocarcinoma
Justification: The diagnosis clearly states ""prostatic adenocarcinoma"" as the histologic type of cancer present.

Stage: Not provided
Justification: While the report provides extensive details on the size, location, and extent of the tumor foci, it does not explicitly assign a stage to the cancer.

Grade: Gleason score 9 (4+5)
Justification: The diagnosis includes a Gleason score of 9 (4+5), which is a measure of how aggressive the cancer is likely to be based on its appearance under the microscope.

Behavior: Malignant
Justification: Prostatic adenocarcinoma is by definition a malignant tumor, as it has the ability to invade surrounding tissues and metastasize to other parts of the body."

FINAL PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS
A.Anterior prostatic fat, excision :Benign fibroadipose tissue.3/ -7I/(J
B.Prostate, left lateral margin ,biopsy :Benign fibroconnective tissue.
C.Lymph nodes ,right pelvic ,dissection :No tumor in four lymph nodes (0/4).

E.Prostate and seminal vesicles ,radical prostatectomy:
1.Prostatic adenocarcinoma ,Gleason score 3+5 =8, margins negative ;see comment.
2.Seminal vesicles with no tumor.
COMMENT:
The tumor is composed of admixed Gleason patterns 3, 4, and 5, with approximately 50% of the tumor
showing Gleason pattern 3, 40% showing Gleason pattern 4, and 10 %showing Gleason pattern S.
According to Gleason grading guidelines (see reference below ),if>5% of the tumor shows a tertiary
Gleason pattern with the highest grade ,then this grade should be reflected in the overall score. Thus,
in this case, since 10 %of the tumor shows Gleason pattern 5, we have assigned Gleason score 3+5=8.

In the preceding intraoperative frozen section an additional lymph node metastasis of
prostatic adenocarcinoma was found (1/1).
Additional immunohistochemical analyses (D2-40, CD 31) on tissue blocks SBR1 an SBR2 revealed
no lymphatic or venous invasion. *Despite the fact that no lymphatic or venous invasion was
assessed, it has to be assumed that at the point of lymph node metastasis L1 was present.

This addendum is issued to add additional diagnostic information in regard to specimens A and B, 
labeled ""LEFT AND RIGHT PELVIC LYMPH NODES"", respectively. The ""RADICAL 
PROSTATECTOMY"" specimen reported above should be labeled ""C"". 
A. LYMPH NODE, LEFT PELVIC, EXCISION: 
-NO TUMOR SEEN IN SEVEN LYMPH NODES (0/7) 
B. LYMPH NODE, RIGHT PELVIC, EXCISION: 
-NO TUMOR SEEN IN FIVE LYMPH NODES (O/S)  "," Site: Prostate
Laterality: Right and left
Histology: Adenocarcinoma
Stage: pT3a (extraprostatic fat involvement)
Grade: Gleason score 7 (grade group 2)
Behavior: Malignant (cancer was excised, but positive surgical margin on the left lateral base)

Justification: The diagnosis of adenocarcinoma is based on the patient undergoing a radical prostatectomy with cancer involving right, left, anterior, posterior, apical, and basal aspects. The stage is determined by the extraprostatic fat involvement, and the grade is given as Gleason score 7 (grade group 2). The behavior of this tumor is malignant, as it was excised but with a positive surgical margin on the left lateral base."

"," Site: Prostate
Justification: Specimen submitted is a prostate gland

Laterality: Not applicable as the cancer is in the prostate gland which is a midline structure

Histology: Adenocarcinoma
Justification: The specimen shows evidence of malignant epithelial cells arranged in glands, consistent with adenocarcinoma.

Stage: pT3aN0Mx
Justification: The pathological staging indicates that the tumor has invaded the periprostatic fat and/or bladder neck but there is no evidence of lymph node or distant metastasis.

Grade: Gleason Grade 5+5, Sum 10
Justification: The Gleason grading system is used to evaluate the aggressiveness of prostate cancer based on architectural patterns. In this case, the tumor has been assigned a grade of 5 in two areas, resulting in a sum of 10 which indicates a high-grade tumor with a poor prognosis.

Behavior: Malignant
Justification: The specimen shows evidence of invasive adenocarcinoma, indicating malignant behavior."
