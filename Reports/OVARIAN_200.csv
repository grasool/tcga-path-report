Type of tumor :Papillary serous carcinoma.
Grade of tumor :High grade (grade III/III).
Site of tumor :bilateral.
Cut surface :solid and cystic
Necrosis :moderate.
Lymphatic/ vascular invasion :absent.
Sites of metastasis in pelvis and abdomen :multiple (involving pelvic

FIGO stage :Stage IV
TNM stage :pT3cNxMl
Additional comments :This tumor demonstrates predominantly papillary serous architecture
consisting largely papillary and solid growth pattern with slit-like spaces. In addition, there are
areas with prominent malignant squamous component, which suggests endometrioid
differentiation. The tumor cells are highly pleomorphic with high mitotic activity with abnormal
mitotic figures. Areas of necrosis are present. Focally, individual tumor cells are seen to contain
intracytoplasmic mucin droplets, supported by the positive staining with PAS-D but this population
iswell below 10% of the tumor cells. The metastatic implants demonstrate destructive invasion
and widespread involvement of tissues in the pelvic and abdominal cavities.
Intraoperative Consult Diagnosis
FS1 (A): Omentum, omentectomy: Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma
2 of 7 SURGICAL PATHOLOG* WORKING DRAFT
Clinical History
The patient is a year-old woman who undergoes omentectomy and bilateral salpingo-
oophorectomy.
Gross Description
The specimen is received fresh, in eleven parts, each labeled with the patient's name and number.
Part A, received fresh and labeled ""omentum,"" consists of a large piece of fibro-fatty tissue
measuring 19.0 x
14.5 x 4.2 cm. The specimen appears to be diffusely involved by a tumorous mass. Serial
sectioning of the
tissue reveals grey firm homogeneous tissue which diffusely involves the fatty omentum. In
addition, there
are round nodular masses located sporadically through the omentum. A section is taken for frozen
section
analysis (FS1) with subsequent placement in cassette Al. Additional sections of tumor involving
omentum
are submitted in cassettes A2-A4.
Part B. received fresh, labeled ""bilateral ovaries and tubes, large ovary is left,"" consists of one
large complex
piece consisting of two ovaries, two fallopian tubes, and an abundant amount of complex
parametrial and
adnexal tissue. There is no uterus or cervix included in this specimen. The large cystic ovary is
designated
as left by the surgeon, and consists of a large cystic component measuring 7.5 x 6.5 x 5.9 cm in
association with a complex, firm, solid, tumorous mass. The entire specimen measures 11.5 x 6.1 x
3.8 cm.
The cystic portion is opened to reveal abundant yellow-green fluid which is drained. Associated
fallopian
tube measures 4.9 cm in length and 0.5 cm - 0.9 cm in varying diameter. The right-sided ovary
consists of
multiple nodular masses and cystic structures and measures 6.9 x 7.2 x 4.5 cm in aggregate. The
cysts
contain an abundant amount of serous, slightly yellow-tinged fluid. The solid areas consist of
multiple well
circumscribed, firm, tan-grey, fish-flesh-like masses. The right-sided fallopian tube measures 5.2
cm in
length and 0.4 cm - 0.9 cm in varying diameter, and appears unremarkable. Between the two
ovarian
masses there appears to be extraneous tissue consisting of nodular, firm, yellow-tan-grey, and
homogenous masses that number at least four. Both ovaries and associated structures are inked
black on
all surfaces. A portion of each ovary is designated for research purposes. Representative sections
of the
right ovary including solid and cystic masses are submitted in cassettes B1-B3. Cross- sections of
the
right fallopian tube are also submitted in cassette B3. Representative sections of firm, grey-yellow
nodular
areas are submitted in cassettes B4-B6; these represent the tumorous mass located in the midline
between
3 of 7 SURGICAL PATHOLOcs WORKING DRAFT
the two ovaries, involving parametrial and other ill-defined structures. The left ovary and large cyst
are

Gross Description 
The specimen is received in seven parts, labeled with the patient's name and medical record number. 
Parts 
A and B are received fresh. Parts C-F are received in formalin. 
Primary surgery 2 of 4 
 Part A, additionally labeled ""omentum,"" consists of a section of red-tan, fibrofatty and firm tissue 
measuring 
13.0 x 13.0 x 2.0 cm. The specimen is studded with multiple yellow-tan to yellow-white nodules 
ranging in 
size from 0.2 cm up to 2.5 cm in greatest dimension. A 1.0 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm portion of the specimen is 
taken for tumor banking, and representative sections are submitted in cassettes Al-A2. 
Part B, additionally labeled ""right ovary plus tube,"" consists of a partially cystic, partially solid structure 
with no identifiable ovary and attached fallopian tube, which measures 11.0 x 9.0 x 4.0 cm and weighs 
238.2 gm. The cystic portion measures 4.0 cm in greatest dimension and has a cyst wall that ranges 
between 0.1 and 0.2 cm in greatest dimension, and has two exophytic papillary-like structures on the 
external surface, which measure 2.0 and 0.8 cm in greatest dimension, respectively. Deep to these, the 
specimen is solid and has a fleshy, yellow-tan, irregular parenchyma. The solid portion measures 4.0 x 3.0 
x 2.0 cm. The attached fallopian tube measures 3.5 cm in length x 0.4 cm in average diameter, is smooth, 
pink-tan, and otherwise unremarkable. The external surface of the specimen is inked in black. A 
representative section of the solid portion is SUbmitted as frozen section 1 with the remnant in cassette B1. 
The remainder of the specimen is submitted as follows: 
Cassette B2: Representative sections of fallopian tube. 
Cassette B3: Representative sections of larger mass on exterior surface of cyst. 
Cassette B4: Representative sections of smaller exophytic mass on external surface of cyst. 
Cassettes B5-B6: Additional representative sections of cyst. 
Cassettes B7-Bl0: Representative sections of solid portion of cyst. 
Part C, labeled ""uterus, cervix, left ovary and tube and rectosigmoid colon,"" consists of a uterus, attached 
cervix, fallopian tube and attached soft tissue tumor mass, and attached short segment of sigmoid colon. 
The uterine specimen measures 7.5 cm from superior to inferior, 5.5 cm from cornu to cornu and 4.0 cm 
from anterior to posterior. The cervix measures 3.5 cm from side to side, 3.0 cm from anterior to posterior 
and approximately 2.0 cm in length. The serosal surface of the uterus is tan-brown, smooth and glistening, 
with areas of subserosal hemorrhage scattered throughout. The cervical mucosa is tan-white, smooth and 
glistening, again with small areas of punctate mucosal and submucosal hemorrhage. The specimen probes 
to 6.5 cm and is opened along the lateral surfaces. The endocervical mucosa is pale tan and measures 1.0 
mm in thickness. The endometrium is also pale tan, and free of polyps and masses. The endometrium 
measures 2.0 mm in thickness. The myometrium is serially sectioned, revealing no mural lesions. The 
myometrium averages 1.3 cm in thickness. Two nodular masses of tissue are attached to the left surface of 
the uterus. The serosal surfaces of both are similar, each with a very nodular contour, covered by a 
tan-brown serosa, and grossly obvious tumor nodules. Grossly, it is difficult to ascertain which of these 
two masses contains the ovary, however one does appear to be attached to the uterus by a tubular 
structure, likely the fallopian tube. This portion of tissue measures 7.5 x 4.5 x 4.0 cm and the adjacent 
tubular structure measures 2.5 cm in length, with an average diameter of 1.0 cm. Serial sections through 
the mass reveal no grossly obvious ovarian tissue, though a lumen filled with necrotic tissue is identified in 
the previously-described tubular structure. The adjacent mass of tissue has a similar gross appearance 
and measures 5.5 x 4.5 x 3.5 cm. One portion of the specimen contains a thin-walled cyst filled with 
translucent fluid, measuring 3.0 cm in greatest diameter. On cut section, the specimen is composed of 
multiple nodules of tan-white, firm tissue ranging in size between 0.5 and 2.0 cm. Adherent to the uterus 
and ovary is a segment of large bowel measuring 14.0 cm in length with an average diameter of 4.0 cm. 
The serosal surface is diffusely caked with tumor nodules ranging in size between 0.2 and 0.5 cm, though 
with confluence of tumor in other areas. What is thought to be the proximal margin is received stapled 
shut, with the distal margin remaining open. Upon opening, a scant, tan-brown mucoid material is 
identified. The mucosa is pale tan, and unremarkable. Sections are submitted as follows: 
Cassette C 1: Anterior cervix. 
Cassette C2: Posterior cervix. 
Cassette C3: Anterior endomyometrium. 
Cassette C4: Posterior endomyometrium. 
Cassettes C5-C6: Sections of putative ovary. 
Primary surgery 3 of 4  Cassette C7: Putative fallopian tube. 
Cassettes C8-C9: Mass adjacent to ovary. 
Cassette CIO: Proximal bowel margin. 
Cassette Cll: Distal bowel margin. 
Cassette C12: Sections through unremarkable bowel mucosa. 
Cassette C13: Representative sections of small bowel serosa. 
Part D, labeled"" rectum, staples proximal,"" consists of a single, short segment of rectum measuring 6.5 cm 
in length with an average diameter of 2.5 cm. Attached to the specimen is a large amount of very irregular 
and fragmented brown-tan, fibrous connective tissue measuring 8.5 cm in width x 4.0 x 2.5 cm. The 
surrounding soft tissue is inked prior to opening of the staple surface at the proximal margin. The 
specimen is opened to reveal pale tan-brown, glistening mucosa with no grossly identifiable masses or 
lesions. A section of the proximal margin is submitted in cassette D 1. A section of the distal margin is 
submitted in cassette D2. A random section is submitted in cassette D3. The attached fibrous connective 
tissue is serially sectioned, revealing a pericolonic mass of tan-white tumor measuring 3.0 x 2.5 x 2.0 cm. 
The tumor mass approaches the proximal margin of resection within 1.0-2.0 mm, and the lateral margin of 
resection within 3.0 mm. A representative section is submitted in cassette D4. 
Part E, labeled ""transverse colon tumor,"" consists of an irregular and fragmentary tan-brown, polypoid 
mass measuring 3.4 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm. The specimen is serially sectioned, and representative sections are 
submitted in cassette E1. 
Part F, labeled ""small bowel mesentery,"" consists of a single ovoid nodule of yellow-tan, soft tissue 
measuring 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm. The specimen is entirely submitted in cassette F1. 
Part G, labeled ""bladder peritoneum,"" consists of an irregular and fragmentary tan-brown, polypoid mass 
measuring 3.4 x 1.8 x 1.0 cm. The specimen is serially sectioned, and representative sections are

â€¢ .... J. I "," Site: The specimens are taken from various sites including hepatic flexure, cecum, small bowel, colon, ileum, mesentery, right lower quadrant, peritoneum, diaphragm, gallbladder, soft tissue, and anterior abdominal wall. Justification: The specimens are taken from different locations to investigate the presence and extent of tumors.

Laterality: Laterality is provided for some of the specimens, including right, left, and upper quadrant. Justification: Providing laterality helps locate the site of the biopsy or resection in the body.

Histology: The histology report indicates various types of tissues and growths, including adenocarcinoma, fibrofatty tissue, foreign-body giant-cell reaction, benign growth, and skeletal muscle. Justification: Knowing the type of tissue or growth helps determine the appropriate treatment.

Stage: The stage is not provided in this report. Justification: Staging requires information on the size of the tumor, lymph node involvement, and metastasis, which may not be available from these specimens.

Grade: The grade is not provided in this report. Justification: Grading requires assessing the differentiation of the tumor cells, which may require more extensive sampling than what was done here.

Behavior: The behavior refers to whether the growth is benign or malignant. In this report, some specimens are described as benign, while others show evidence of adenocarcinoma, a type of malignancy. Justification: Knowing the behavior of the growth helps determine the appropriate treatment and prognosis.",,,,,,,,,

Clinical nt,,,,,,, 
The patient is a history of a pelvic mass, undergoing 
resection of 
abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. 
Gross Description 
The specimen is received in six parts, each labeled with the patient's name and 
medical record number. 
Parts A and C are received fresh, and Parts B, D-F are received in formalin. 
Part A is received fresh from the O.R., for frozen section, additionally labeled ""uterus, 
cervix, ovaries, 
Page 2 of 6 
rectum, and left ureter -FS,"" and consists of a composite resection specimen 
including: uterus (5.5 cm 
from superior to inferior, 5.0 cm cornu to cornu, and 3.5 cm anterior to posterior), 
cervix (1.Scm x 1.0cm), 
ovaries and fallopian tube, a segment of descending colon and rectum (23.0cm in 
length x 3.0cm diameter) 
and an unattached segment of ureter (S.Ocm in length x 0.3cm in diameter). 
Centered in the left adnexa is a 14.0 x 7.0 x 6.5 cm solid and cystic mass. The solid 
portion (8.5 x 6.6 x 4.0 
cm) is soft, pink-tan with areas of apparent necrosis, and comprises approximately 
40% of the mass. The 
cystic portion of the mass is composed of multiple smooth walled cystic spaces 
without excresences. No 
residual ovary is identified in the mass. The solid portion infiltrates through the distal 
portion of the 
rectum with invasion through the rectal wall, ulceration of the mucosa, and 
penetration into the lumen. 
The proximal and distal margins of the colon/rectum are free of tumor. Tumor 
approaches to wthin 3.Scm 
from the distal margin (rectum) and to within 10 cm of the proximal margin 
(descending colon). The tumor 
contains a cauterized surface near it's invasion into the rectum. The surgeon 
indicates the separate 
segment of left ureter was present adjacent to this cauterized area. Additionally, 
tumor infiltrates into the 
posterior wall of the uterus with invasion into but not through the myometrial wall. 
The uterine cavity 
overlying the area of tumor invasion appears grossly unremarkable. The tumor does 
not appear to involve 
any other structures grossly. Two lymph nodes are found between the ovarian mass 
and the rectum. 
Representative sections of the solid component of the mass and sections of tumor  infiltrating rectum are 
submitted for frozen section diagnosis #1 with the frozen remnants in cassettes AlÂ­
A3. Additionally, 
portions of the mass as well as uninvolved endomyometrium are submitted for 
research. 
The uterus additionally shows multiple nodules, sub-mucosal and sub-serosal, with 
firm, white-tan cut 
surfaces showing a whorled appearance. These nodules range in size from 0.7 to 
2.2cm in maximal 
diameter and do not appear to be associated with the adnexal mass. No areas of 
hemorrhage, necrosis, or 
cystic degeneration are identified in these nodules. The ectocervix (1.0 x 1.0 cm) has 
a smooth white-tan 
surface without focal lesions. The cervical os is fish-mouthed and measures 0.7 cm in 
greatest dimension. 
The endocervix has glistening tan-brown mucosa and appears grossly unremarkable. 
The endometrium is 
thin, tan-brown, and grossly appears atrophic. The right ovary is white-tan, 
measures 2.5 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm 
and shows no gross abnormalities. The right fallopian tube (4.5 cm length x 0.5 cm 
diameter) appears 
grossly unremarkable. The anatomic area of the left fallopian tube appears to consist 
entirely of infiltrating 
tumor and no residual fallopian tube is identified grossly. The separate portion of left 
ureter is unoriented, 
appears intact, and shows no evidence of involvement by tumor.

Result of Her-2/neu test: This carcinoma is negative for Her-2/neu 
oncoprotein overexpression. 
An immunohistochemical assay was performed on block All using the CBll 
monoclonal antibody to 
Her-2/neu oncoprotein. The staining intensity of this carcinoma was 0 on a scale of 
0-3 with focal 
cytoplasmic staining only. 
Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of a or 1 are considered negative for 
overexpression of Her-2/neu 
oncoprotein. 
Those with a staining intensity score of 2 are considered borderline. We and others 
have observed that 
many carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 do not show gene amplification. 
All carcinomas with 
staining intensity scores of 2 are therefore submitted for FISH testing. The results of 
the FISH test are 
issued directly from the molecular cytogenetics laboratory. 
Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 3 are considered positive for 
overexpression of Her-2/neu 
oncoprotein. Tumors in this category show an excellent correlation between the 
results of 
Page 4 of 6 
immunohistochemical and FISH testing, and almost always show gene amplification.

An immunohistochemical test for estrogen and progesterone receptors was 
performed on block A8. 
The test for estrogen receptors is positive. There is 3+ nuclear staining in 10% of 
tumor cells. 
The test for progesterone receptors is negative. There is no nuclear staining in tumor 
cells. 
Result of Her-2/neu test: This ovarian carcinoma is negative for Her-2/neu 
oncoprotein over-expression. 
An immunohistochemical assay was performed on block AS using the CBll monodonal antibody to Her-
2/neu oncoprotein. The 
staining in_ensit of this carcinoma was 0 on a scale of 0-3 with focal cytoplasmic staining only (Her-2 test 
interprete . 
Carcinomas wit stammg mtensity scores of 0 or 1 are considered negative for over-expression of Her-
2/neu oncoprotein. 
Those with a staining Intensity score of 2 are considered borderline. We and others have observed that 
many carcinomas with staining 
Page 2 of 5 
intensity scores of 2 do not show gene amplification. All carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 are 
therefore submitted for 
FISH testing. The results of the FISH test are issued directly from the molecular cytogenetics laboratory. 
Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 3 are considered positive for over-expression of Her-2/neu 
oncoprotein. Tumors in this 
category show an excellent correlation between the results of immunohistochemical and FISH testing, and 
almost always show gene

ovary measures 3.5 x 
3.0 x 1.8 cm. The fallopian tube measures 7.0 cm in length and 1.0 cm in average 
diameter. The end of 
the fallopian tube has a papillary, white-brown mass protruding from it. The ovary 
has a papillary mass, 
measuring 3.0 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm, attached to the external surface and growing toward 
the fallopian tube. The 
external surface is otherwise unremarkable. The ovary and fallopian tube are 
bisected, demonstrating a 
firm nodule, measuring 1.5 cm, within the central aspect of the ovary. Additionally, 
there is a papillary, 
white-tan nodule, measuring 1.2 cm, within the tubal fimbria. No other lesions are 
noted. A portion of the 
papillary mass on the fimbria as well as from the surface of the ovary is submitted 
for frozen section 
diagnosis as FS1, with the frozen section remnant submitted in cassette A1. 
Representative sections of the 
remainder of the tissue is submitted as follows:

The patient is a with a 13-cm complex pelvic mass and 
history of left breast 
carcinoma, status post lumpectomy, lymph node dissection, and chemo-radiation. 
She undergoes total 
abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. 
Gross Description 
The specimen is received in twelve parts, each labeled with the patient's name and 
medical record number. 
Parts C-L are received in formalin. 
Part A, received fresh and additionally labeled ""right adnexa,"" consists of an ovary 
with attached fallopian 
tube that weigh 383.5 gm and measure 15.0 x 14.0 x 10.0 cm. The ovary capsule is 
intact with 
multiloculated cysts, and the external surface is smooth with no tumor or masses 
seen on the surface. 
Upon sectioning of the ovary, there are multiple papillary excrescences. There are no 
hemorrhagic or 
obvious necrotic areas. The cystic fluid is brown. The ovarian mass itself is ~13.0 
cm. There is no 
obviOUS grossly normal ovarian tissue present. The fallopian tube measures ~7.0 cm 
in length. It is 
difficult to assess the diameter given that there appears to be tumor involvement of 
the fallopian tube. In 
the most normal area of the fallopian tube, the diameter is ~0.7 cm. A frozen section

Gross Description 
The specimen is received in eleven parts, each labeled with the patient's name and 
medical record number. 
Parts A-E are received fresh. Parts F-K are received in formalin. 
Part A, labeled ""left tube and ovary frozen section,"" consists of a large cyst with no 
grossly identifiable ovary 
weighing 165 gm and measuring 7.5 x 6.5 x 5 cm, intact. The surface is smooth and 
is inked black. There 
is a fallopian tube (4 x 0.5 x 0.5 em) and the fimbral is attached to the mass by 
adhesions. The cyst 
contains 120 cc of watery brown fluid. The cyst is composed of a multiloculated, 
partially solid 
consistency. The deflated cyst measures 5 x 6.5 x 1.2 cm and weighs 24 gm. 
Approximately 25% of the 
cyst is solid, composed a soft, white-tan, solid component or a fibrous, brown, solid 
component. The rest 
of the cyst is multicystic with the cysts containing golden yellow, papillary 
outgrowths on the inner surface.

Part B, labeled ""right tube and ovary,"" consists of multiple soft, fragmented, irregular 
pieces of 
pink-red-purple tissue weighing 31.2 gm and measuring 7.7 x 5.6 x 2 cm in 
aggregate. The largest 
fragmented piece consists of multiple papillary outgrowths attached to a smooth 
lining suspended from the 
fallopian tube. The fallopian tube measures 4.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm and is hemorrhagic. 
Using the fallopian 
tube for orientation, the papillary areas are present on a fragment of cyst wall that 
corresponds to the 
inside surface of the cystic mass, although exact orientation is not possible. In 
addition to this, there are 
multiple, separate fragments measuring 3.5 x 3.5 x 1 cm in aggregate. On serial 
sectioning, these are 
composed of yellow and white adipose tissue with small areas of white-tan fibrinous 
exudate. A random

Part B is received fresh and is additionally labeled ""right pelvic L node polyp"" and 
consists of an ovoid 
mass that measures 4 x 3.5 x 2 cm. The mass also has attached yellow fat. A portion 
of the 
specimen was taken for Oncotech study. The surface of the specimen is inked black 
and it is serially 
sectioned to reveal a rubbery, tan, nodular parenchyma. Representative sections are 
submitted in 
cassettes Bl-B3. 
Part C, additionally labeled ""left peri-aortic lymph nodes,"" consists of a single 
irregularly shaped, soft 
to firm, yellow-tan fibrofatty tissue fragment measuring 5 x 1.3 x 0.8 cm. 
Examination of the 
specimen reveals four lymph node candidate, which are submitted as follows: 
Cassette Cl: One lymph node candidate, bisected. 
Cassette C2: Two lymph node candidates, bisected. 
Cassette C3: One small lymph node candidate, submitted intact.

irregularly shaped, 
yellow-tan to bright red, fibrofatty tissue fragment measuring 6.2 x 2.3 x 0.6 cm in 
greatest 
dimension. Careful examination of the specimen reveals three lymph node 
candidates, each of which 
are bisected, then individually submitted in cassettes 01-03. 
Part E, additionally labeled ""right ovarian vessel,"" consists of an elongate, irregularly 
shaped, red-tan 
to light yellow tissue fragment measuring 7 x 3.2 x 0.4 cm in greatest dimension. 
Careful 
examination reveals a single clamped small vessel, fibrous tissue, and four lymph 
node candidates.

sectioned at regular intervals, revealing no further discrete nodules, masses, or 
obvious lymph 
nodes. Additional sections are submitted in cassettes K3-K4. 
Part L, additionally labeled ""appendix,"" consists of a single soft, rubber, pink-tan, 
vermiform appendix 
measuring 5.1 cm in length x 0.5 cm in average diameter. The resection margin has 
been stapled 
shut using small silver-gray laparoscopic staples. A mesoappendix measures 5.5 x 2 
cm in greatest 
dimension and is soft, without lesion or mass. The mesoappendix is removed from 
the main portion 
of the specimen and is serially sectioned to reveal soft, yellow-tan, uniform fibrofatty 
tissue 
throughout, without lesion or mass. The mesoappendix is returned to the container. 
The resection 
margin of the appendix is inked black. The specimen is then sectioned and crossÂ­
sectioned to reveal 
a single, pink-tan, lined lumen measuring 0.3 cm in average diameter. The 
appendiceal wall 
averages 0.1 cm in diameter. No obvious fecal matter or masses fill the lumen of the 
specimen. The 
bisected tip is removed to reveal no abnormalities or lesions. The remainder of the

This high-grade adenocarcinoma appears to be of ovarian origin with widespread peritoneal implants. 
The carcinoma shows a predominantly serous papillary pattern, but a large amount of the tumor 
burden displays a solid glandular pattern. Numerous psammoma bodies are present. 
Focal Iymphovascular invasion is seen. 
Although no peritoneal wash specimen was obtained, peritoneal washings are presumed to be

Gross Description 
The specimen is received in multiple parts labeled with the patient's name and ID number. Parts A 
through E are received fresh and parts F through H are received in formalin. 
Parts A, additionally labeled ""omentum"" consists of a large mass of soft, irregularly-shaped, 
red-white-yellow tissue measuring 15.0 x 12.0 x 6.0 cm in greatest dimension. This tissue mass 
appears to comprise of some omental fat which is studded with multiple nodules of varying sizes. 
The nodules appear to be confluent in some areas. The nodules range in size from 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm 
to 6.0 x 5.0 x 3.0 cm. These multiple nodules appear to have various consistencies. One of the large 
nodules is tan-white and firm; a section of this large firm nodule is submitted for frozen section. 
FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS #1 
Omentum, biopsy: tissue consistent with metastatic carcinoma of ovarian origin, with features of 
Page 2 of 4 
papillary serous carcinoma. 
The remainder of this frozen section specimen is subm entirely in cassette A1. 
In addition to this large firm nodule (6.0 x 5.0 x 3.0 cm, frozen section obtained from middle of 
nodule), there are additional nodules which are slightly softer in consistency. Also present are some 
thin, fluid-filled cysts. These nodules are scattered throughout the omentum and are at the edges of 
the resected specimen. Serial sectioning of all nodules reveal that most nodules are of the firm-white 
variety with a few nodules being extremely soft and almost papillated on cut appearance. The thin, 
luid-filled areas when cut reveal cystic spaces filled with some clear serous fluid as well as some 
papillary regions. Additional representative sections are submitted as follows: 
Cassette A2 Cystic portion of tumor with cyst wall and 
papillary excrescences extruding into cyst wall 
Cassette A3 Additional section of fibrous large nodule 
Cassette A4 Representative section of soft papillary portion 
of tumor 
Cassette AS Additional representative section of one of the 
firm nodules 
Part B, additionally labeled ""pelvic mass left"" consists of multiple fragments of extremely soft, 
irregularly-shaped, tan-white tissue measuring approximately 6.0 x 7.0 x 2.0 cm in aggregate. A 
small piece of this tissue is submitted for frozen section diagnosis. 
FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS #2 
Left biopsy: neoplasm, favor malignant, final diagnosis deferred. 
The remainder of the frozen section tissue is submitted entirely in cassette B1. An additional 
representative section is submitted in cassette B2. 
Part C, additionally labeled ""right ovary and tube"" consists of a large mass of soft, irregularly-shaped 
bosselated tissue measuring 7.0 x 7.0 x 3.5 cm In greatest dimension. Protruding along one edge of 
this mass of tissue appears to be a fallopian tube which is slightly dilated in portions, especially more 
distal. The fimbriated ends of the this fallopian tube are slightly blunted. A small, white, firm 
structure, possibly representing an ovary is noted on the surface of this mass and measures 
approximately 2.0 x 1.0 x 0.8 cm. This mass is bisected to reveal an ovary which has been largely 
replaced by this large soft, bosselated lesion. The remaining ovarian tissue appears to be grossly 
unremarkable. This papillary process involves the entire ovary, however, no definite ovarian source 
f origin is grossly identified. The fallopian tubes are then serially sectioned to reveal grossly 
unremarkable fallopian tubes in the proximal portion and a dilated fallopian tube in the distal portion 
 with what appears to be tumor in the lumen. Representative sections are submitted as follows: 
'::assette Cl Fallopian tube (normal and with tumor) 
Cassette C2 Ovary with relation to papillary growth 
Cassette C3 Additional section of grossly unremarkable 
ovary adjacent to papillary growth 
Part D, additionally labeled ""left pelvic mass"" consists of multiple fragments of soft, 
irregularly-shaped, tan-white papillated tissue measuring 10.0 x 5.5 x 5.0 cm in aggregate. No 
identifiable organ is found within this tissue mass. Portions of the mass appears to be slightly more 
solid while other portions are more papillary. Representative sections of the more solid portions are 
submitted in cassette Dl and representative sections of the more papillary area are submitted in 
cassette D2. 
Part E, additionally labeled ""pelvic tumor"" consists of multiple fragments of friable, 
irregularly-shaped, soft tan-yellow tissue measuring 15.0 x 11.0 x 6.0 cm in aggregate. The tissue 
appears to consist of multiple nodules of friable solid to papillary tissue ranging in size from 0.5 x 0.3 
Page 3 of 4 
x 0.1 cm to 9.0 x 5.0 x 2.0 cm. These large nodules are sectioned to reveal some predominantly 
solid areas while other areas demonstrate a more papillary appearance. On the exterior surface of 
one of the nodules, there appears to be a firm white-yellow fibrous portion of unknown significant. 
Representative section of this firm white-yellow area next to tumor is submitted in cassette El and 
an additional representative section of tumor is submitted in cassette E2. 
Part F, additionally labeled ""sigmoid tumor"" consists of three friable pieces of red-tan, soft, 
irregularly-shaped tissue measuring 2.0 x 0.8 x 2.0 cm in aggregate. One of the pieces appears to be 
some fibrous tissue while the other two pieces are more polypoid in appearance. The two polypoid 
pieces are bisected and the specimen is submitted entirely in cassette Flo 
Part G, additionally labeled ""uterus, cervix"" consists of an uterus with attached cervix and without 
adnexa weighing 47 grams. The uterus measures 7.3 cm from fundus to cervix, 4.1 cm from cornu to 
;ornu, 2.9 cm from anterior to posterior, and is oriented by the peritoneal reflexion. The serosa is 
smooth and is not distorted. The uterine cavity sounds to 6.3 cm. The cervix measures 2.5 cm in 
lenght and 3.0 cm in width. The external os is fish mouth-shaped and measures 1.3 cm in width. 
The uterus is opened along the lateral borders. The ectocervix and endocervical canal are 
unremarkable. The endometrium is tan, measures 0.1 cm in thickness, and contains no polyps. The 
myometrium measures 1.2 cm and contains no leiomyomas. On the posterior surface of the cervical 
uterine junction, there is a small firm nodule measuring 1.2 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm. This nodule is sectioned 
to reveal a firm homogenous interior. The main substance of the uterus and cervix appear to be 
grossly uninvolved by tumor; however, more parametrial tissue is present on the left than right. The 
left parametrial tissue appears to be grossly involved by tumor. Representative sections are 
submitted as follows: 
Cassette Gl Firm nodule at external posterior cervical 
uterine junction (in entirety) 
Cassette G2 Anterior cervix 
Cassette G3 Posterior cervix 
Cassette G4 Anterior endomyometrium 
Cassette G5 Posterior endomyometrium 
Cassette G6 Left parametrium 
Cassette G7 Right parametrium 
Part H, additionally labeled ""sigmoid serosa tumor"" consists of multiple fragments of extremely 
friable, irregulary-shaped, soft, tan-white tissue measuring 10.0 x 8.0 x 2.0 cm in aggregate. The 
tissue is sectioned to reveal some portions of solid consistency while others are more papillary and 
friable. Representative sections of the more solid portions are submitted in cassette Hl and

COMMENT:
Ovarian Tumor Synoptic Comment
Type of tumor :The tumor is predominantly serous carcinoma; however, extensive areas of solid growth
are present and areas of endometrioid and clear cell patterns are noted. Additionally a focal 1.1 cm
sarcomatous area (slides, A4,A5) is noted (see below for further discussion of this focus).
Grade of tumor: III.
Site of tumor :Bilateral.
Location of tumor :Intraovarian.
Condition of capsule :Indeterminate (the capsule of both ovaries arrived ruptured; it is not clear if the
capsule was transected in the OR or if the capsule was ruptured).
Cut surface :Solid and cystic.
Necrosis :Moderate.
Lymphatic /vascular invasion :Lymphatic space invasion present.
Sites of metastasis in pelvis :Right and left fallopian tube, uterine serosal surface, paracervical soft
tissue, sigmoid colon; maximum diameter of largest pelvic metastasis = 2.0 cm (adherent to right
fallopian
tube).
Pelvic lymph nodes :2/3 lymph nodes with metastatic tumor.
Sites of metastasis in abdomen :Omentum; maximum diameter of largest abdominal metastasis = 8.0
cm.

Other abnormalities: None.
FIGO stage: IIIc.
""TNM stage :pT3cNlMx.
'Comment :Immunoperoxidase stains were performed on the sarcomatous element. This focus stains
strongly for vimentin and shows only focal staining for keratin. This staining pattern supports an
interpretation of sarcoma rather than sarcomatoid carcinoma, thus a small (1.1 cm) sarcomatoid focus is
present (carcinosarcoma). Given the small size of this focus, it will likely have little effect on the overall
prognosis.has reviewed this slide (A5) in the immunohistochemical results and concurs with
this interpretation.

Gross Description
Part A is received fresh and labeled ""left ovary"" and consists of a 14.0 x 12.0 x 5.5 cm lobulated, tan-
white,
purple solid and cystic mass with generally smooth external surface, but rare surface nodules which are
white-tan-yellow and focally confluent, up to 2.5 cm in aggregate, covering approximately 5% of the
external
surface. A 9.5 cm irregular rupture or incision exposes soft, lobulated tan-red interior, focally cystic but
generally solid. Additionally, there is an attached 7.5 x 1.0 cm diameter fallopian tube with fimbria which
is
grossly unremarkable. Although the mass has been previously ruptured, an attempt is made to ink the
surface. The cut surface reveals a proliferation with friable papillary areas, light tan necrotic areas, myxoid
and yellow degenerate areas, multiple cystic cavities and occasional hemorrhagic foci. Tissue was removed
for research. Sections:

Additional comments: We favor this to be a primary serous carcinoma of the left ovary with peritoneal 
spread to the right adnexa, and intracavitary spread to the endometrial polyp and superior cervix. The 
possibility of a primary uterine carcinoma with to the ovary seems unlikely given the extensive 
involvement of the left ovary with synchronous primary serous carcinomas cannot be 
excluded yet also seems less likely. has reviewed the slides and concurs.

Justification: The pathology report describes a papillary serous carcinoma in the left ovary with peritoneal spread and positive cytology, as well as an endometrial polyp with adenocarcinoma. The extensive involvement of the left ovary suggests a primary serous carcinoma arising from that site, with secondary spread to the right adnexa, endometrium, and peritoneum.

Result of Her-2/neu test: This ovarian carcinoma is negative for Her-2/neu oncoprotein 
overexpression. 
An immunohistochemical assay was performed on block B3 using the CBll monoclonal antibody to 
Her-2/neu oncoprotein. The staining of was 0 on a scale of 0-3 with cytoplasmic 
staining only (Her-2 test interpreted by 
Page 2 of 7 
Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 0 or 1 are considered negative for overexpression of Her-
2/neu 
oncoprotein. 
Those with a staining intenSity score of 2 are considered borderline. We and others have observed that 
many carcinomas with staining intenSity scores of 2 do not show gene amplification. All carcinomas with 
staining intenSity scores of 2 are therefore submitted for FISH testing. The results of the FISH test are 
issued directly from the molecular cytogenetics laboratory. 
Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 3 are considered positive for overexpression of Her-2/neu 
oncoprotein. Tumors in this category show an excellent correlation between the results of 
immunohistochemical and FISH testing, and almost always show gene amplification.  Intraoperative Consult Diagnosis

Clinical HI!5te,r'lL 
The patient is a G3 Pi, with a 17 x 11 em complex pelvic mass, carcinomatosis, and 
an increased CA-125 level (443). The patient undergoes exploratory laparotomy, total abdominal 
hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy, appendectomy, tumor debulking and 
rectosigmoid resection with a primary anastomosis. 
Gross Description 
The specimen is received fresh in thirteen parts, each labeled with the patient's name and medical record 
number. 
Part A is additionally labeled ""omentum."" It consists of a single fragment of omentum, measuring 22 x 18 
x 
3 cm. The omentum is studded with multiple white-pink nodules, ranging in size from 0.2 cm to 5.0 cm. A 
representative section is submitted for frozen section diagnosis as FS1, with the frozen section remnant 
submitted in cassette A1. An additional representative section is submitted in cassette A2. 
Part B is additionally labeled ""uterus, cervix, ovaries and tubes plus tumor."" It consists of a single 
hysterectomy specimen weighing 800 grams and measuring 14 cmfrom fundus to cervix, 4.5 cm from 
cornu to cornu and 9.0 cm from anterior to posterior. The cervical portion of the specimen measures 3 cm 
in length and 2 cm in diameter. The uterus is distorted by multiple firm, white-tan, whorled leiomyomata 
ranging in size from 0.3-5.5 cm in average diameter. No necrosis or hemorrhage is identified in any of the 
leiomyomata. The endometrium is tan-pink and measures 0.2 cm in average thickness. The myometrium 
is distorted by the multiple leiomyomata and therefore ranges in thickness from 1.0-2.7 cm in thickness. 
The uterus is oriented by the peritoneal reflections. Within the left adnexa, there is a 2.5 x 1.5 x 1.3-cm 
firm, white nodule which may represent ovarian tissue. There is an additional firm, white-yellow, solid 
region measuring 2.5 x 1. 7 x 1.0 cm which may represent tumor within the adnexa. A small segment of 
fallopian tube is identified measuring approximately 3 cm in length and 0.8 cm in average diameter. There 
are additional small, white, firm nodules which apparently represent tumor studding the adnexal tissue. 
These nodules obscure the normal anatomy and make orientation difficult. The right adnexa contains a 
firm, white region measuring 3.0 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm which may represent ovarian tissue. A portion of fallopian 
tube measuring approximately 4 cm in length and 0.7 cm in average diameter is present. Again, multiple 
firm, white regions, possibly representing tumor are present within the adnexa precluding exact 
identification of the normal anatomy. A representative section of the specimen is submitted for frozen 
section analysis as frozen section #2, with the remnant submitted in cassette B1. Within the specimen 
container, there are multiple unoriented fragments of firm, white-tan tissue representing tumor measuring 
13.5 x 13 x 4 cm in aggregate. Representative sections of the remainder of the specimen are submitted as 
follows: 
r-assette B2: Anterior cervix. 
assette B3: Posterior cervix. 
Cassette B4: Anterior endomyometrium.  \~h'ri(lr endomyometrium. 
Cassette B6-B7: Representative sections of leiomyomata. 
Cassettes B8-B10: Representative sections of left adnexa. 
Cassettes B11-B13: Representative sections of right adnexa. 
Cassette B14: Representative sections of loose tumor fragments. 
Part C is additionally labeled ""rectosigmoid colon."" It consists of a single segment of colon, measuring 7.1 
cm in length and 2.0 cm in average diameter. Adherent to the serosal surface is mesenteric fat, 
measuring 
10.5 x 9.0 x 3.0 cm, which is studded with abundant firm, white nodules, ranging in size from 0.2 cm to 
2.5 cm. The largest of these nodules abuts the radial surface of the colon. However, it does not appear to 
invade the muscular wall nor the mucosa. The pericolonic fat is extensively studded with tumor, and 
therefore, an adequate lymph node dissection cannot be performed. The specimen was received with 
staple 
lines at each colonic resection margin. One end is inked in blue and the opposite inked in black for 
microscopic evaluation (no orientation was provided). A representative section of tumor is taken for 
Oncotech analysis. Representative sections are submitted as follows: 
Cassettes Cl-C2: Resection margins (perpendicular). 
Cassettes C3-C5: Tumor in approach to colonic wall. 
Cassette C6: Additional representative section of pericolonic fat.

which 
is attached to the white-tan component. Representative sections are submitted in cassette H1. 
Part I, additionally labeled ""appendix,"" consists of a 4 cm in length x 0.6 cm in average diameter appendix 
with attached yellow-brown mesoappendix. The serosal surface of the appendix is brown and glistening. 
At the tip of the appendix, a white-brown, cirrhotic lesion is present, measuring 1.8 x 1.2 x 1 cm, 
involving 
the tip of the appendix. The tip of the appendix, including the transition into the white, cirrhotic lesion, is 
submitted in cassettes 11-12. Representative cross-sections of the appendix and mesoappendix are

COMMENT: 
The tumor shows complex papillary architecture with a multilayered syncytial-appearing epithelium 
with abundant budding, The tumor cells are pleomorphic with relatively abundant eosinophilic 
cytoplasm, a very high N:C ratio, and coarse vesicular chromatin with prominent eosinophilic 
nucleoli. Abundant mitotic figures and apoptotic cells are seen, The findings are most likely those of 
a high-grade serous carcinoma, and the large cell size with eosinophilic cytoplasm suggests the 
oxyphilic variant thereof. However, the differential diagnosis can include oxyphilic variants of clear 
cell carcinoma or a high-grade endometrioid adenocarCinoma. The absence of extra-ovarian tumor 
given the size of the primary is also rather unusual for serous carcinoma. Serous carcinoma is 
nonetheless favored as the overall growth pattern is most consistent with this diagnosis, and areas 
with well-developed features of either clear cell or endometrioid adenocarcinoma are not seen. 
Additional stains were necessary to properly assess this case, and these were performed and 
evaluated with the following results: 
-WTl: Positive. 
-p53: Positive, variable intensity. 
-ER: Negative. 
-PR: Focal, patchy positive, 
-CA125: Positive. 
The expression of WTl is most consistent with an ovarian serous carcinoma, which is also supported 
by the diffuse expression of p53 and CA125, and low-level or absent expression of PR and ER 
respectively. Although p53 staining is diffuse, the intenSity varies more than is typical of serous 
carcinoma. Nonetheless, the diagnosis is not excluded by this pattern. In contrast, expression of 
â€¢ 'ITl and diffuse p53 argues against clear cell carcinoma, and while some PAS-positive material is 
:esent, this is diastase-resistant and therefore not compatible with glycogen. At least some of the 
material is mucin and stains with mucicarmine. The expression of WTl and poor expression of ER  and PR also argue against endometrioid adenocarcinoma.

The specimen is received in eight parts, each labeled with the patient's name and medical record 
number. Parts A and B are received fresh. Parts C through H are received in formalin. 
Part A is additionally labeled ""left ovary and tube."" It consists of a single unoriented, intact, red 
salpingo-oophorectomy specimen, weighing a total of 908 gm and measuring 16.8 x 11.5 x 9.5 cm, 
including an attached fallopian tube, measuring 7.5 x 1.2 x 1 cm. The external surface of the ovary 
and tube is predominantly smooth, except for a vague, ill-defined, approximately 3 cm area on the 
ovarian surface which is slightly irregular in texture. This area is inked in blue, and the remaining 
surface is inked in black. Although irregular, no overt papillary excrescences are seen. In addition, 
the fallopian tube resection margin is inked in green. The fallopian tube appears unremarkable, and 
no discrete lesions are seen or palpated, and the fimbriae are lush. The ovary is sectioned to reveal 
a soft, fleshy, gray-white, almost-solid interior with an irregular, up-to-6 cm apparently necrotic 
cavity in the middle. The tumor is soft and has a grossly discernible papillary appearance. There is  also a single smooth-walled, 4 cm, unilocular cyst filled with a clear, yellow-brown fluid as well as an 
adjacent 2.4 cm, unilocular, hemorrhagic cyst. This latter cyst directly underlies the blue-inked area 
and contains multiple small papillary excrescences along the wall as well as a 1.5 cm, solid area with 
a consistency similar to the rest of the bulk tumor. The fallopian tube is sectioned and appears 
grossly unremarkable. A representative section of the tumor is submitted for frozen section diagnosis 
as FS1, with the frozen section remnant submitted in cassette A1. In addition, approximately 150 gm 
of the tumor is submitted for tissue banking. Additional representative sections are submitted as

Part A, labeled ""left adnexa,"" consists of an ovary with attached fallopian tube weighing 327.5 grams. 
The ovary is replaced by a mass and measures 15 x 10.5 x 5.5 cm, and the fallopian tube measures 
10 cm in length x 0.5 cm in diameter. Gross photographs are taken. The external surface of the 
ovary is noted to be smooth, tan-white-gray and shiny. No surface adheSions, solid tumor or 
papillary growth, or implants are noted. The tumor capsule is intact. Upon sectioning, the cut 
surface of this nodule appears to be yellow-orange. Sectioning of the tumor reveals 70% solid 
growth with 30% cystic area. The cystic area is multiloculated and contains yellow serous fluid. The 
solid portion of the ovary is yellow, lobulated, firm, with punctate areas of hemorrhage. The cystic 
rea is also noted to contain some areas of hemorrhage. The interior of the cyst is noted to contain 
papillary excrescences. A portion of the specimen is submitted for frozen section diagnosis 1, with 
the remnant submitted in cassette A14. The attached fallopian tube and fimbriae appear grossly 
 unremarkable. However, a small, white-tan nodule measuring 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm is visible on the 
surface of the mesosalpinx. An additional nodule measuring 0.4 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm is palpable within the 
mesosalpinx. Representative sections are submitted as follows:

Part 8, labeled ""right adnexa,"" consists of an ovary with attached fallopian tube weighing 296 grams. 
The ovary is replaced by a mass and measures 12 x 9.5 x 6.5 cm. The tube measures 9 cm in length 
x 0.5 cm in diameter. A portion of the specimen is sent for Oncotech, and sample tissue is taken for 
ovarian tumor banking. The surface of the ovary is noted to be tan-white-gray and smooth, without 
adhesions, solid tumor, papillary growth or implants. The tumor capsule appears to be intact. 
Sectioning of the ovary reveals an 80% solid, 20% cystic mass. The solid areas are tan-white-yellow 
and firm/rubbery, and also contain soft and papillary areas. Small areas of hemorrhage are noted in 
the solid areas. No obvious areas of necrosis are noted. The cystic areas within the tumor contain 
papillary excrescences and a yellow serous fluid. The cystic area is noted to be unilocular. The 
fimbriae are grossly unremarkable. However, approximately 2.2 cm from the fimbriae, a hard nodule 
is palpable within the fallopian tube, measuring 1 x 0.8 x 0.7 cm. Representative sections are

1 I 1"," Site: The primary tumor site is not explicitly mentioned in the report, but based on the description of high-grade serous carcinoma involving various anatomical structures, it can be inferred that the most likely primary site is the ovary or fallopian tube.

Laterality: The laterality is not consistently provided for all specimens, but when mentioned, there are metastatic lesions on both sides of the body.

Histology: High-grade serous carcinoma is the predominant histological type observed in this report. This type of cancer is commonly associated with ovarian and fallopian tube tumors.

Stage: The extent of the disease suggests a late-stage presentation, as there are metastatic lesions found in various anatomical locations, including lymph nodes, soft tissues, and abdominal organs. However, a formal staging classification is not provided in this report.

Grade: The grade of the tumor is consistently reported as high grade, indicating aggressive behavior and poor differentiation.

Behavior: The behavior of the tumor is malignant, with metastatic lesions found in multiple anatomical locations.",,,,,,,,,

Histology: The histological diagnosis includes serous adenocarcinoma, stromal hyperplasia, leiomyoma, benign paratubal cysts, and metastatic carcinoma. These different types of tumors suggest a complex medical condition requiring various treatments.

Stage: The stage of the disease is not provided in the diagnosis, making it difficult to determine the extent of the cancer and the appropriate treatment plan.

Grade: The grade of the serous adenocarcinoma is III, indicating a high-grade malignancy with a poor prognosis.

Behavior: The behavior of the tumors is malignant, meaning they are capable of invading surrounding tissues and metastasizing to other parts of the body, which is consistent with the diagnosis of metastatic carcinoma in multiple sites.",,,,,,,,,

Comment:The tumor shows combinations of solid ,cystic, and
papillary growth patterns .Tumor in all of the affected tissues
shows high grade features that include large nuclei, anisonucleosis,
prominent nucleoli ,tumor giant cells ,and frequent mitotic figures.
While the ovaries are not markedly enlarged, tumor replaces at least
approximately half of each ovary. The histology is consistent with
ovarian primaries but the possibility of a peritoneal primary is not
excluded -.4A portion of omental tumor was submitted for clonogenic

P14530(3"," Site: Peritoneum, vagina, right pelvis, left pelvis, anterior abdominal wall, lesser omentum, retroperitoneum - These are the different sites from where the biopsies were taken.

Laterality: Not provided - The report does not mention any laterality as the samples were taken from various sites in the abdomen and pelvis.

Histology: Atypical cells (negative for cytokeratin and CK16) - This suggests that there are some atypical cells present in the samples, but they do not express cytokeratin or CK16, which could indicate a specific type of tumor. However, no definite carcinoma was seen.

Stage: Not provided - The report does not mention any staging information as it is not applicable to biopsy results.

Grade: Not provided - The report does not mention any grading information as it is not applicable to biopsy results.

Behavior: Not definitively benign or malignant - While no definite carcinoma was seen, the presence of atypical cells raises some concern. Further studies and clinical correlation are necessary for a definitive assessment.",,,,,,,,,

COMMENT: Both ovaries are enlarged and subtotally replaced by
carcinoma .By convention, the neoplasm is considered to be a
bilateral primary ovarian neoplasm; however ,the involvement of the
mucosa of both fallopian tubes by carcinoma (in addition to the outer
aspects of the fallopian tubes which are involved tumor), the
possibility of synchronous primary tubal neoplasms are also
considered .The carcinoma consists of multiple components ,including
serous carcinoma ,carcinoma with transitional or pseudotransitional
features, endonetrioid carcinoma ,anaplastic carcinoma, and a small
subpopulation of tumor cells exhibiting cytoplasmic clearing .Tumor-
associated necrosis is present in both ovaries ,as well as in
multiple other metastatic sites. Secondary acute and chronic
inflammatory changes are present in both ovaries and many of the
metastatic sites .Lymphovascular invasion by carcinoma is present in
most of the involved sites .Adhesions and secondary reactive
mesothelial change are noted in many of the involved sites. The

I, _.the pathologist of record, have
personally examined the specimen, interpreted the
results, reviewed this amended report and signed it
electronically.
DateFinalled:"," Site: Various including sigmoid mesenteric tumor, rectal tumor, right pelvic tumor, cul-de-sac peritoneum, right side wall tumor, left pelvic lymph node, peritoneal biopsy, right obturator lymph node, appendix, small bowel tumor, right diaphragmatic tumor, liver surface, falciform ligament, right hemidiaphragm, and left peritoneal tumor. The report describes gross examination of various specimens from different sites in the patient's body.

Laterality: Right (right pelvic tumor, right diaphragmatic tumor, right hemidiaphragm), Left (left peritoneal tumor), Bilateral (bilateral adnexae), and not provided for most other sites. The laterality is mentioned in the site description.

Histology: Not all specimens are described in terms of histology, but high-grade adenocarcinoma is mentioned in one specimen. Adenocarcinoma is a type of cancer that starts in glandular cells and can be high or low grade depending on how abnormal the cells look under a microscope.

Stage: Not provided in the report. Staging of cancer requires information about the size of the tumor, whether it has spread to nearby lymph nodes, and whether it has metastasized to distant organs, which is not available in this gross examination report.

Grade: High grade is mentioned in one specimen. The grade of a tumor refers to how abnormal the cells look under a microscope and can help predict how likely the cancer is to grow and spread.

Behavior: Not provided in the report. Behavior refers to whether the tumor is malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous).

SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT
Page 6of6"," Site: Transverse colon, ileocecal valve, pericolic fat, rectosigmoid epiploica
Laterality: Not provided (not relevant for these sites)
Histology: Adenocarcinoma (transverse colon), metastatic tumor (pericolic fat), mullerian carcinoma (not specified in the report)
Stage: The stage is not explicitly provided, but based on the description of the tumors, it could be at least stage II for the transverse colon and ileocecal valve, and stage I for the pericolic fat metastasis.
Grade: Not provided (requires microscopic evaluation)
Behavior: Malignant (based on histology and size of tumors)
Justification: The report describes adenocarcinoma in the transverse colon and ileocecal valve, with metastatic tumor deposits in the pericolic fat. Additionally, there is a separate finding of mullerian carcinoma. The size and extent of the tumors suggest malignant behavior, but the grade cannot be determined without microscopic evaluation.",,,,,,,,,

CCrT: The right ovary is massively involved and is nearly totally,
replaced by adenocarcincoa. Tumor in the right ovary appears to be
primary at that site. The left ovarian neoplasm probably represents
a second (synchronous) primary neoplasm. Carcinoma in all of
the involved sites exhibits predominantly serous features, albeit
with focal 'undifferentiated'/anaplastic components and pseudo-
transitional appearance in some areas. In a few of the involved
sites, the tumor exhibits hobnail and/or clear cell features. The
carcinoma exhibits papillary, glandular and solid patterns of
growth. Tumor-associated psanacma bodies are prominent in most of
the involved sites. Tumor necrosis, secondary acute and chronic
inflammnratory changes, fibrosing stramal reaction to tumor, and
adhesions are noted in many of the involved sites. Lymphovascular
invasion by carcinoma is present virtually in most of the involved

COMMENT: In both adnexa, the bulk of the tumor is iuvolves the ligamentous soft tissues aud 
there is a huge volume of tumor iu the omeutum; therefore, a peritoneal primary carcinoma is 
cousidered in the differential diagnosis. However, since there is also invasive tumor measuring 
more than 1 cm in the left ovary, by convention, this would be considered ~ primary ovarian 
neoplasm. Pathologic MX. Preliminary pathologic 
findings were conveyed Immunohistochemical stains, 
performed subsequently, Results of the 
immunostains are listed below.

"," Site: The specimens are taken from various sites including the appendix, omentum, small bowel lymph node, small bowel mesentery, periureteral areas, and bladder peritoneum.
Justification: The site is explicitly mentioned for each of the submitted specimens.

Laterality: The laterality is specified for some of the specimens, with tumors found in both the right and left periureteral regions.
Justification: The laterality is provided when applicable, and not provided when it's not relevant to the specimen (e.g., appendix, omentum).

Histology: The histology of the tumor is not explicitly provided in the description, with two frozen section suggestions being undifferentiated malignant carcinoma or granulosa cell tumor.
Justification: No definitive histological diagnosis is given in the description, and it's up to pathologists to determine based on microscopic examination.

Stage: The stage of the tumors is not provided as it requires clinical correlation and assessment of the extent of the disease.
Justification: Staging information is not available in the gross description.

Grade: The grade or differentiation of the tumor is not explicitly mentioned in the given description.
Justification: No grade information is provided, and it's typically determined based on architectural and cytological features observed via microscopic examination.

Behavior: Based on the description, the tumors are behaving as malignant neoplasms with local invasion (e.g., omental adhesions, periureteral implants).
Justification: The behavior is inferred from the gross findings of local invasion and the fact that it's an undifferentiated malignant tumor.",,,,,,,,,

em from fundus to ectocervix, 3 em from cornu to cornu, and 2.5 em 
from anterior to posterior. The anterior serosal surface is tan with 
multiple fibrous adhesions. On the posterior serosal surface of 
the uterus is a 4 x 3 x 1.5 cm tan nodular mass with a tan, firm cut 
surface. The ectocervix measures 3.5 x 3 em and is lined by tan, 
smooth epithelium. The cervical os is patent and measures 0.7 x 0.4 
cm. The uterus is opened anteriorly. The endocervical canal 
measures 2.2 em and is lined by tan-white rugose epithelium. The 
endometrial cavity measures 3 x 1.5 cm and is lined by tan-red 
velvety epithelium ranging up to less than 0.1 cm. Present in the 
posterior lower uterine segment is a 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm soft, tan 
polypoid tissue. The myometrium measures up to 1.5 em and is tanÂ­
white and fibrous. The left ovary is completely replaced by a tan, 
firm, irregular, solid mass measuring 9 x 7 x 3 cm. The external 
surface of the mass is tan/ white, firm/ irregular with scattered 
areas of congestion. The firm mass encroaches the isthmic portion 
of the fallopian tube and also the fimbriated end. Cut section 
through the mass reveals variegated soft, tan to firm yellow surface 
with scattered areas of congestion. No residual normal ovarian 
tissue is identified. The mass seems to extend to the posterior 
wall of the uterus. The attached fallopian tube measures 8 ern in 
length. The fimbriated end is obscured by the tan, firm mass. The 
mass encroaches on the isthmic portion of the fallopian tube. 
Cut section of the fallopian tube reveals a central stellate lumen 
surrounded by wall thickness ranging up to 0.2 cm. The right 
fallopian tube measures 6.5 em in length t.'1ith an identifiable

MICROSCOPIC: 
See Diagnosis. 
GROSS: 
1: RIGHT OVARY 
Labeled Ilright ovary"", received fresh in the Operating Room and 
subsequently fixed in formalin, is a 17 x 14 X 11 cm solid and cystic 
ovarian neoplasm. The cystic portion contains approximately 1000 cc 
of dark gray-red bloody fluid. There is an additional 10 x 5 x 4 cm 
cystic locule containing approximately 600 cc of clear straw-
colored fluid. This neoplasm is approximately 30% solid and 70% 
cystic in composition. A portion of the solid area is submitted for 
clonogenic assay. The external surface of the ovary wrinkled, tan 
and white l'lith multiple diffuse foci of tumor studding. The cystic 
area's inner cyst lining is smooth and tan-white to bosselated with 
abundant vasculature and no papillary excrescences. The wall 
thickness measures up to 0.1 cm. Upon sectioning I the ""solidll areas 
of tumor, they appear to be composed of both firm solid tan-white 
tumor and softer, friable papillary tan tumor. No residual uninÂ­
volved ovarian parenchyma is identified. Adherent to the cystic 
portion of the ovarYI there is a 11.2 cm long, fimbriated 
fallopian tube with a diameter ranging from about 0.5 to 0.8 cm. 
The serosal aspect of the tube shows a 1.5 cm tan tumor papillary 
and solid tumor nodule at its fimbriated end. The rest of the 
serosal surface of the fallopian tube is red-tan and relatively 
smooth. On section, there is a pinpoint patent lumen. 
Representative sections are SUbmitted.

5: UTERUS, CERVIX, LEFT OVARY 
Labeled lIuterus, cervix, left ovary"" and received in formalin is a 
150 gram total hysterectomy of uterus Hith attached left adnexa. 
The uterus measures 6.5 em from cornu to cornu, 5.3 em anterior to 
posterior, and 7.5 em fundus to ectocervix. Multiple implants of 
tan granular tumor are adherent to the uterine serosa, primarily in 
the upper anterior and posterior corpus and fundus. There is also a 
4.2 x 3.5 x 3.0 em aggregate of tumor involving the right 
peri adnexal/parametrial tissue. The cervix measures 2.5 em in 
length and 2.0 em in diameter. The ectocervix has a surface area of 
2.2 x 2.0 em and surrounds a slit-shaped 0.2 cm in diameter patent 
os. The ectocervix is lined by a smooth pale tan mucosa. The 
endocervical canal is 2.0 cm in length with a maximum width of 0.3 
cm. The endocervix is lined by tan rugose mucosa and contains 
multiple nabothian cysts. The uterine cavity is 4.2 cm in length 
\>lith a maximum \>lidth of 1.0 em. The uterine cavity is distorted by 
the presence of a submucosal leiomyoma measuring 4.5 x 3.2 x 3.0 em. 
The leiomyoma is well-circumscribed and has a firm whorled bulging 
cut surface with no areas of hemorrhage, necrosis or cystic 
degeneration present. The endometrium is tan-red and ranges from 
less than 0.1 to about 0.3 cm in thickness. The endometrium is 
focally papillated and friable consistent with involvement by 
tumor. In some areas, the endometrium is not recognizable, perhaps 
due to replacement of the uterus by invasive tumor from the adnexa. 
The myometrium is attenuated the area involved by the submucosal 
leiomyoma and focally in areas involved by invasive tumor. The right 
uterine viall is soft and necrotic and appears to be involved by 
tumor invading in from the right periadnexal/parametrial tissue. 
The left ovary measures 4.5 x 3.2 x 2.5 em and has a smooth tanÂ­
yellow external surface with small adherent areas of tumor measuring 
up to 2.2 x 1.5 x 0.3 cm. The cut surface of the ovary is pale tanÂ­
yelloH. The fallopian tube measures 5.5 ern in length and 0.5 em in 
diameter and is adherent to the ovary and uterus by dense aggregates 
of tumor measuring 3.5 x 3.0 x 2.0 em involving the mesosalpinx. 
The surrounding tumor does not appear to invade the fallopian tube 
grossly. The fallopian tube has a patent 0.1 cm lumen which appears 
free of tumor. Representative sections are submitted.

COMMENT: The left fallopian tube was not enlarged. Most of the 
grossly evident tumor in the left adnexa appeared to be paratubal, 
rather than intratubal. Although this high-grade papillary serous 
carcinoma extensively involves the left para tubal soft tissues/ 
/ligaments, serosal surface of the left fallopian tube, focally 
involves the muscular wall of the left fallopian tube and is present 
within the lumen and focally involves the mucosa of the fimbriated 
end of the left fallopian tube, a peritoneal primary carcinoma 
rather than a primary tubal carcinoma is favored. The tumor 
exhibits features of high-grade serous carcinoma, for the most 
part, and focallY pseudotransitional features. Growth patterns 
of tumor include papillary, glandular and solid. Tumor-associated 
psammoma bodies are present in many of the involved sites. LymphoÂ­
vascular invasion by tumor is present in most of the involved 
sites. Foci of tumor necrosis are present. Secondary acute and 
chronic inflammatory changes, reactive stromal changes, fibrosis, 
adhesions, and secondary reactive mesothelial proliferation are 
present in'most of the involved sites. No metastatic tumor is 
identified in the sampled lymph nodes. The lymph nodes do sho,""} 
reactive lymphoid proliferation, sinus histiocytosis, foci of 
fibrosis and/or calcifications.

Labeled Â·uterus and tubesn, received fresh in the Operating Room and 
subsequently fixed in formalin, is a uterus with bilateral ovaries 
and fallopian tubes. The specimen weighs 90 grams. The uterine 
corpus is symmetric, measuring 8 em superior to inferior, 5 em eornu 
to cornu, and 3 em anterior to posterior. The serosa is pink-tan 
with adhesions and a few tiny to small granular to nodular deposits 
of firm tan tumor. The cervix has a length of 3 cm and a diameter 
of 2.5 em. There is a 0.4 cm slit-shaped patent os. The ectoÂ­
cervical mucosa is tan and smooth. The transformation zone is 
distinct. The endocervical canal is about 2 cm long and lined by 
tan rugose mucosa. Cut sections of the cervix reveal several mucusÂ­
filled cysts, up to 0.2 cm in diameter. The endometrial cavity is 
4.5 em in length and 2.5 cm in width and is mostly lined by soft redÂ­
tan endometrium with an average thickness of 0.1 ern. Two semisoft 
endometrial polyps are present. One is located in the fundus 
about 1 em in maximum dimension and the other is present Page 3 of5  diameter. The muscular uterine wall has a maximum thickness of 
about 1.5 cm. There is a 1 x 0.9 x 0.9 em well-circumscribed 
subserosal leiomyoma with a firm white focally whorled cut surface 
without hemorrhage or necrosis in the posterior corpus. The right 
ovary is 2.2 x 1.1 x 0.4 em and has a firm tan-yellow cerebriform 
external surface with a few adhesions and a 0.2 em diameter redÂ­
tan granular surface lesion. Cut surfaces of the right ovary 
reveal a narrow rim of yellow-tan cortical stroma, a few firm white 
corpora albicantia, a few minute cystic spaces, and no grossly 
evident invasive tumor. The right tube is 5.5 em in length and 
0.5 em in diameter. The fimbriated area is identified. There are 
multiple small white firm nodules ranging from 0.1 to 0.3 em on the 
serosal surface of the right fallopian tube and involving the 
para tubal soft tissues. A fe\\7 tiny right paratubal cysts are also 
noted. The lumen of the right fallopian tube is patent and the 
wall is grossly unremarkable. The left ovary is 2.2 x 1.1 x 0.4 cm 
and has a firm yellow-tan cerebriform external surface with a 0.2 
em firm nodular surface lesion suspicious for tumor. Cut surfaces 
of the left ovary are remarkable for a narrow rim of yellow-tan 
cortical stroma, several firm white corpora albicantia and a 0.8 em 
thin-1i'lalled, clear fluid-filled cyst lined by smooth tan tissue. 
There is no gross evidence of invasive tumor in the left ovary. 
The left tube is 5.5 cm in length and 0.5 em in diameter. The 
fimbriated area is identified. There are a 3.5 x-2.2 x 2 em whiteÂ­
tan mass and 1 x 0.7 x 0.7 em white-tan firm mass in the para tubal 
tissues. There are also multiple tiny to small firm nodular aggreÂ­
gates of apparent tumor ranging from about 0.1 to 0.8 cm involving 
the serosal surface of the left fallopian tube and fimbriated end 
of the tube. The lumen of the left fallopian tube is patent, for 
the most part, but partially occupied by tumor at the fimbriated 
end.

"," Site: Ovary, fallopian tube, uterus
Laterality: Not provided in the given description
Histology: High-grade serous carcinoma with tumor nodules and cysts in the ovary, broad ligament, and fallopian tube; leiomyoma in the uterus
Stage: Not assigned in the given description
Grade: High grade for the serous carcinoma
Behavior: Malignant, as it is a high-grade serous carcinoma

Justification: The description of the ovarian mass with a largest cyst measuring 1.6 cm and showing minimal blood clot adherent to its lining, along with a firm nodule arising from the cyst lining, suggests high-grade serous carcinoma. The broad ligament's multiple tan-white to tan-grey tumor nodules further support this diagnosis. In the uterus, the presence of a soft endocervical polyp and a subserosal myoma do not interfere with the high-grade serous carcinoma diagnosis in the fallopian tube and ovary.

This high-grade primary ovarian (bilateral ovarian) serous carcinoma 
exhibits predominantly solid growth (with a HundifferentiatedH-like 
appearance), and also exhibits papillary growth and focal glandular 
growth. Both fallopian tubes exhibit secondary involvement by 
serous carcinoma. In addition, the left fallopian tube shows and 
area of intraepithelial/intramucosal carcinoma, which may be primary 
to that site. Intraluminal aggregates of serous carcinoma are also 
present in the left fallopian tube. There is extensive lymphoÂ­
vascular space invasion by carcinoma in all involved sites, 
including the uterus and cervix. Within the uterus, the endometrial 
mucosal involvement by serous carcinoma is predominantly within 
lymphatic spaces. There are, however, a few small foci of mucosal 
involvement extrinsic to lymphatics. While the latter might 
represent primary uterine papillary serous carcinoma, the alternate 
possibility that the endometrial deposits of tumor within the 
incorporated in the final diagnosis.

Labeled with the patient's name, labeled ""right tube and ovary, left tube and ovary, and uterus"", received 
fresh in the Operating Room and subsequently fixed in formalin is a 116 gram total hysterectomy and 
bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy specimen. The adnexa are separate from the uterus. No instructions for 
orientation are provided. The uterus is about 6.2 x 4.5 x 4.0 cm in greatest overall dimensions. The 
cervical portion of the uterus is about 2.0 cm long and up to 3.5 cm in diameter. The endometrial cavity is 
about 3.0 cm long and up to 1.5 cm in width. The endometrial mucosa has a maximum thickness of 0.1 
cm. The muscular uterine wall has a maximum thickness of about 1.5 cm. Attached to the cervix there is 
a cuff of vaginal tissue lined by tan mucosa that is up to 2.0 cm in length posteriorly, and up to O.S cm in 
length, anteriorly. The laterality of the adnexal structures Is uncertain. The larger of the two ovaries is 
4.S x 2.S x 2.4 cm. The ipsilateral fallopian tube has fimbria at one end, is about S.O cm in length and up 
to 0.5 cm in diameter. The adjacent adnexal soft tissues measure up to about 3.0 cm in width. The 
smaller ovary is about 2.0 x 1.S x 1.2 cm. The second fimbriated fallopian tube is 4.5 cm long and ranges 
from about 0.3 to 0.6 cm in diameter. 
There are multiple semi-soft to firm tan tumor nodules involving the serosal surface of the smaller ovary 
and focally invading the cortex of the smaller ovary. These tumor deposits measure up to O.S cm in 
diameter. There are also plaque-like and nodular aggregates of semi-soft to firm tan tumor involving tile 
adnexal soft tissues, bilaterally and the serosal surfaces of both fallopian tubes. There are friable tan 
tumor deposits amounting in aggregate to about 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm involving the parauterine soft tissues. 
No gross tumor is seen in the uterus, including the cervical portion of the uterus, or vaginal cuff. 
The larger ovary appears to be subtotally replaced by a moslly cystic and focally solid tumor that is about 
4.S cm in maximum dimension. The cystic neoplasm in the larger ovary is multiloculated and contains 
yellow fluid. The linings are tan-white and smooth, for the most part. There is some tan-white fibrous 
tissue in the cyst wall. The smaller ovary also shows multiple tiny to small cysts, ranging from less than 
0.1 to about O.B cm in diameter. There appears to be some concentration of cysls with some intervening 
white fibrous tissue over an area measuring about 1.0 em in diameter in the smaller ovary. Adhesions 
involving the adnexal structures and focally involving the serosa of the uterus are also noted. No gross 
pathologic lesions of the endometrium or myometrium are seen. The cervix shows extensive mucosal 
ulceration with focal associated necrosis. No gross pathologic lesions of the vaginal cuff are seen.

uncertain whether tumor involving the left ovary represents a synchronous primary 
neoplasm or a metastasis. In light of the finding of serous intraepithelial carcinoma in 
the left fallopian tube, the possibility of a second primary tubal neoplasm is considered 
to be likely. [If this does represent a second primary neoplasm, the tumor stage for the 
tubal neoplasm would be assigned as follows: pTis, NX.] Lymphovascular invasion by 
carcinoma is present in most of the involved sites. Secondary acute and chronic

10.0 cm. The adjacent fallopian tube has fimbriated at one end, is about 7.0 cm long and ranges from 0.5 
to 1.0 cm in diameter. 
The ovary is nearly totally replaced by a cystic and solid tan-white neoplasm. Maximum tumor dimension 
is close to 13.0 cm. The cystic component of the neoplasm accounts for about 75-80% of the total 
volume and is multiloculated. The cystic loculations range from about 0.5 to 10.0 cm diameter. Some of 
the cystic loculations contain blood-tinged yellow amber fluid. Most of the cystic loculations are lined by 
smooth tan tissue and one is partially lined by soft friable tan tumor over an area measuring about 1 .5 cm 
in diameter. The solid component of the tumor which accounts for about 15-25% of the total volume is 
white-yellow and firm. There are also multiple (about 10 or 12) nodular and plaque-like tumor 
excrescences on the serosal surface of the ovary involving an area measuring up to about 5.0 cm in 
diameter. The ovarian capsule is not ruptured. There are similar appearing nodular and plaque-like 
aggregates of tumor involving the paraovarian and paratuballigamentous soft tissues. The fimbriated 
end of the fallopian tube also shows about 1.0 cm diameter deposit of semi-soft to firm tan-white tumor,

ovary with adhered fimbriated fallopian tube measuring 6.5 cm in length and 0.4 cm in with. 
The external surface of the ovary is light tan-yellow, and fibrotic. There is a focal area of excrescences 
identified measuring 0.4 cm in greatest dimension. Sectioning of the ovary reveals the ovary is 
approximately 99% replaced by a poorly circumscribed hemorrhagic. tan-white, necrotic, mainly solid and 
focally papilliferous tumor measuring 11.0 x 10.0 x 5.8 cm. The papillary appearing area constitutes 
10%ofthe tumor. No cystic formation is grossly noted. No residual ovarian parenchyma can be grossly 
identified. 
The serosa of the fallopian tube is dusky purple-red, congested and contains multiple minute paratubal 
cysts containing clear serous fluid. Cut section reveals no gross tumor and a stellate lumen measuring up 
to 0.1 cm in diameter.

COMMENT: 80th ovaries are atrophic and each shows extensive (mostly) serosal 
surface involvement by serous carcinoma. In both ovaries, there are small nodular 
aggregates of tumor within ovarian parenchyma. In the right ovary the maximum 
dimension of invasive tumor in the ovary is about 0.8 cm; thereby, qualifying by currently 
established criteria as a right ovarian primary neoplasm. Tumor in all involved sites 
exhibits features of high-grade serous carcinoma. Lymphovascular invasion by 
carcinoma is present in most of the involved sites. Tumor-associated necrosis, fibrosing 
stromal reaction to tumor, acute and chronic inflammatory changes, adhesions, and 
secondary reactive mesothelial proliferation are also noted in vicinity of tumor in many of 
the involved sites. The focus of high-grade epithelial dysplasia/serous intraepithelial 
carcinoma involving the fimbriated end of the left fallopian tube may represent a â€¢

B. LEFT TUBE AND OVARY 
Labeled with the patient's name, labeled ""left tube and ovary"", and received fresh in the Operating Room 
for intraoperative frozen section and subsequently fixed in formalin is about a 53.7 gram salpingoÂ­
oophorectomy specimen. The ovary was incised at the time of intraoperative consultation and now in the 
partially collapsed state is about 6.0 x 5.5 x 4.0 cm. The fimbriated fallopian tube is about 5.0 cm long, 
ranges from 0.5 to 0.7 cm in diameter and has a maximum luminal diameter of 0.2 cm. 
The ovary is virtually replaced by a cystic and solid neoplasm that is about 6.0 cm in maximum 
dimension. The cystic component of the neoplasm accounts for about 40% of the tumor volume and is 
multiloculated. The cystic loculations range from about 0.2 to 3.5 cm in maximum dimension and contain 
clear yellow fiuid. Some of cystic loculations are lined by a smooth tan tissue and some are lined by 
papillated tan tissue. The solid component of the neoplasm is composed of firm, white-yellow tissue. 
The capsule of the ovary is intact, but the similar-appearing tumor also involves the serosal surface of the 
ovary. The ligamentous adnexal soft tissue adjacent to the ovary and fallopian tube show nodular and 
plaque-like aggregates of semifirm tan tumor ranging from about 0.1 to 1.0 cm in diameter. There is also 
about a 0.2 cm nodular aggregate of similar-appearing tan tumor on the serosal surface of the fallopian 
tube. 
There is about a 0.3 cm diameter fiuid-filled thin-walled paratubal cyst. Adhesions on the adnexa are also 
noted. 
A gross photograph of the specimen is obtained.

Labeled with the patient's name, labeled ""right tube and ovarY', and received fresh in the Operating 
Room for study, and subsequently fixed in formalin is a 26.7 gram salpingo-oophorectomy 
specimen. The ovary was incised at the time of intraoperative consultation. The ovary is about 4.5 x 3.5 
x 2.5 em. The adjacent fimbriated fallopian tube is 5.0 cm long and ranges from 0.6 to 1.0 cm in diameter 
with a maximum luminal diameter of about 0.3 cm. 
The ovary is subtotally replaced by firm white-yellow tumor. The tumor within the ovary is about 2.5 cm in 
maximum dimension. There are also several nodular and plaque like aggregates of firm tan-white tumor 
on the serosal surface of the ovary. The latter of which ranges from about 0.2 to 1.0 cm in diameter. The 
fallopian tube appears to be partially replaced by tan-white semisoft to firmer tumor. Tumor in the 
fallopian tube involves the mucosa, wall and focally obstructs the lumen of the fallopian tube. 
Attached to the fallopian tube, there is a thin-walled translucent fluid-filled paratubal cyst that is about 0.2 
cm in diameter.

 endometrial cavity is about 3.5 cm long and up to 2.0 cm in width. The endometrial mucosa ranges from 
about 0.1 to 0.3 cm in thickness. The muscular uterine wall ranges from about 1.5 to 2.5 cm in thickness. 
Attached to the cervix, there is an up to 0.3 cm long cuff of vaginal mucosa. 
The serosal surface of the uterus and outer aspect of the cervix are partially coated by nodular and 
plaque-like aggregates of firm tan tumor. The tumor deposits on the external aspect of the uterus and 
cervix range from about 0.5 to 1.5 cm in maximum dimension. Cut sections of the anterior uterine corpus 
reveal a mass of tan-white tumor that is mostly firm but shows areas of softening that involve the 
muscular wall of the uterus. The intramural portion of the tumor is about 4.0 cm in maximum dimension. 
There are also a few areas of induration of the endometrial mucosa which are tan-white and up to 0.3 cm 
in diameter that may represent tumor. Most of the tumor in the uterus and cervix appear to represent 
metastatic tumor. 
There is a well-circumscribed 1.3 cm diameter intramural leiomyoma in the anterior lower uterine 
segment that is composed of firm solid tan-white whorled tissue without grossly evident areas of 
hemorrhage or necrosis. Except for the areas of induration, noted above the endometrial mucosa is

Microscopic Description and Comment: 
Sections of the endometrium, left ovary and omentum show mixed high grade serous carcinoma and endometrioid 
carcinoma (overall aboul60% endometrioid and 40% serous). There Is also high grade serous carcinoma in the 
cervix, right ovary, peritubal soft tissue of the left fallopian tube and detached intraluminal fragments of high grade 
serous carcinoma within the right fallopian tube. Within the endometrium, the carcinoma Invades the myometrium and 
extends to the cervical mucosa with stromal invasion. 
Whenever there Is carcinoma in the ovaries and endometrium, It can be difficult or impossible to decide whether these 
represent synchronous primary tumors or whether one site represents metastatic spread from another site. In this 
case, factors that favor an endometrial primary with metastases to ovary and peritoneum include the presence of an 
Identical mixed serous and endometrioid morphology in both locations as well as myometrial Invasion, Iymphvascular 
space invasion and cervical extension In the uterus. However, clinical correlation Is recommended to arrive at a final 
determination.

white cassette labeled ""FS111. The cassette contains a 1.5 x 1.5 x 0.2 em piece of tan, 
rubbery soft tissue. Labeled AI. Additionally, within the container is a mass of omental 
fat measuring 15 x 11 x 3.5 cm. Much of the omentum has been replaced by mul.tiple firm tumor 
masses, which have coalesced into a larger tumor mass measuring 15 x 4 x 2.5 cm. The surface 
of several of the masses have a subtle papillary architecture. Two additional sections 
labeled A2. Jar 3. 
The second container is labeled ""R ovary and fallopian tube."" It contains a 6 x 4 x 3.2 
em mass of tan to red tissue. The external surface of the ovary and the fallopian tube 
contains disrupted tissues with fibrinous adhesionsl and possible tumor. The anatomy of 
both the fallopian tube and the ovary is difficult to identify because of the adhesions and 
possible tumors. Multiple tumor masses are identified l which may be in continuity with each 
other. One appears to be within or next to the fallopian tube, measuring 1.5 x 0.9 x 1.2 
cm. A closely associated nodule appears to be within the para ovarian tissues measuring 1.0 
Page 2 of 4  x 1.0 x 1.2 cm. In addition, ""'ithin the identifiable ovarian parenchyma itself, there is an 
area of papillary excrescences, which is exposed to the surface, which may also represent 
tumor. Labeled B1 -ovary \1ith exposed tumor and adjacent fallopian tube \1ith tumor, B2 -
section of ovary and paraovarian tumor; B3 -section of fallopian tube without gross tumor, 
and second section of ovary with possible tumor; B4 -additional section of tumor possibly 
within fallopian tube, and adjacent ovary ""lith possible tumor. Jar 1. 
The third container is labeled 1I1arge bowel nodule and serosal implant."" It contains 
multiple pieces of tissue measuring, in aggregate, 2.0 x 2.0 x 0.1 cm. The largest piece 
appears to have fat, with a small! 0.6 cm in greatest dimension, firm, white! subserosal 
nodule. There is a smaller piece of tissue also present containing tissue suspicious 
for tumor. No orientation of the smaller specimens is possible. Labeled Cl -section of 
subserosal nodule! and sections of firm tissue suspicious for tumor. Jar 1. 
The fourth container is labeled ilL ovary.1I It contains three pieces of irregularly-shaped 
tissue, which is not grossly identifiable as tube or ovary. The largest piece is 4.5 x 
3.0 x 1.5 em! and has firm, pink-tan tissue, grossly suspicious for tumor. A small amount 
of adipose tissue is present on the specimen! as \1ell. The surfaces are regular, with 
a papillary gross appearance. One of the smaller pieces contains tissue which possible 
represents residual ovary. No fallopian tube is identified. Labeled Dl, D2 -sections of

The fifth container is labeled ""appendix."" It contains a 5 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm vermiform 
appendix, with a dark red, tan surface suspicious for tumor. Serial cuts through the 
appendix reveal an intact appendiceal lumen, with a mass of firm, gray-tan tumor in the 
adventitia, and focally involving the muscularis of the appendix. Labeled E1 -tumor in 
adventitia and musclei E2 -normal-appearing appendix. Jar 1. 
The sixth container is labeled IIsmall bowel."" It contains an 18 em in length x 2.0 
em in diameter segment of bo"",el. The serosa of the bOl'lel is dark brown, and possibly 
ischemic appearing. The bmvel is opened to sho"", green-to-brotvo mucosa, \'lith an area of 
possible ischemia measuring approximately 7 em in length, 6 crn from one of the stapled 
ends. In addition, there is an area of constriction. Within the mesentery, several areas 
are suspicious for involvement by tumor, with the largest measuring 1.0 em in greatest 
dimension. Labeled F1 -one staple margin; F2 -other staple margin; F3 -two sections from 
possible ischemic region; F4 -possible tumor implants. Jar 3. 
The seventh container is labeled ""porta hepatis mass. II It contains several fragments of 
tissue, the largest representing a tumor mass measuring 3.6 x 2.5 x 1.7 cm. The tissue 
consists entirely of tan, slightly papillary tissue, with an occasional cyst on the surface. 
On cut section, a solid, tan-white tumor mass is present, with central necrosis. Two 
sections labeled Gl. The remaining pieces of tissue have a similar appearance to the larger 
piece of tissue. Jar 1. 
The eighth container is labeled ""R external iliac In.'' It contains a 5.0 x 4.0 x 1.0 em 
aggregate of fat, and five possible lymph nodes. The largest lymph node measures 3.5 x 1.0 
x 1.0 cm. Upon sectioning, this lymph node has multiple small lumens, and may represent a 
large, fibrovascular cord. Labeled H1 -five lymph nodes; H2 -larger fibrovascular cord in

extensive poorly differentiated papillary serous adenocarcinoma. The tumor has a high 
nuclear grade, a well developed papillary architecture in many areas, and is associated ''lith 
numerous psammoma bodies. The tumor effaces large areas of the ovaries and is present on 
the ovarian surfaces, and extends into the paratubal soft tissue. Of note, foci of in situ 
papillary serous adenocarcinoma are noted in the tubal epithelium. Diffuse lymphvascular 
space invasion in the adnexa is also noted. Extensive sectioning of the additional fragments 
of tissue received with the TAH/BSO specimen show large fragments of soft tissue entirely 
effaced by tumor. One fallopian tube is not identified in the multiple sections sUbmitted. 
Sections of the uterus show diffuse serosal metastasis by papillary serous carcinoma. In 
addition! there is extensive lymphvascular space permeation by tumor in the myometrium, 
lower uterine segment, and cervix, and in some areas the foci of intravascular tumor 
are invading into the immediately adjacent stroma. In addition, extensive metastatic

Intraoperative Consultation: An intraoperative non-microscopic consultation was obtained and
interpreted as: ""Called to pick up ""omentum,"" consisting of a 13.8 x 6.5 x 4.9 cm omental
cake nearly entirely replaced by metastatic tan-grey tumor. A portion is frozen for FS and a
portion of tumor retained for Tumor Repository,"" by
FS1: Omentum, omentectomy - ""Poorly differentiated carcinoma, consistent with Mullerian
origin,"" by
Microscopic Description and Comment: Poorly differentiated
adenocarcinoma of mixed epithelial type, with endometrioid and serous differentiation, is
present in multiple locations. The bulk of the tumor is in the omentum which is diffusely
replaced,but large tumor implants are also present on the uterine serosa and on the
surfaces only of both ovaries. One fallopian tube is distended by a 1.5 cm nodule of tumor
inthe lumen. Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma is present in the peritubal soft tissue
of the other fallopian tube. Because of the history of endometrial adenocarcinoma in a
recent endometrial biopsy performed at an outside institution, the entire endometrium
has been submitted for histologic evaluation. Very focal microscopic foci of moderately
differentiated adenocarcinoma of endometrioid type are present. There is no associated
myometrial or lymphvascular space invasion. Sections of lower uterine segment and cervix are
free of carcinoma. Several small leiomyomas are identified within myometrium, the largest
measuring 1.5 cm.
When tumor is present in multiple locations in the female genital tract it is difficult
to determine whether tumor in one location is metastatic from another site or whether
they represent synchronous primary tumors. Because the bulk of the tumor in this case
is peritoneal, and the tumor in the endometrium is microscopic and not associated with
myometrial or lymphvascular space invasion, I favor that these represent synchronous primary
peritoneal and endometrial carcinomas or that the endometrial carcinoma is metastatic from
the peritoneum.
History: The patient is ayear old woman with omental cake, abnormal ovaries and carcinoma
of the endometrium (biopsied atpoorly differentiated
adenocarcinoma). Operative procedure: Laparotomy; omentectomy; total abdominal hysterectomy
and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy; radical tumor debulking.

The second container is labeled ""omentum #3."" It holds multiple irregular fragments of
omental fat occupied by multiple tumor nodules, ranging in size from 0.5 to 3 cm. The
specimen measures 10 x 10 x 4 cm in aggregate. Sections of tumor nodules labeled Bl. Jar 2.
The third container is labeled ""uterus, cervix, BSO."" It holds a uterus including cervix
and two detached ovaries with corresponding fallopian tube. The uterus is 50 grams and 6
x 3.5 x 3 cm. The uterine serosa on one aspect, which appears to be the anterior aspect,
shows a 3 x 2 cm solid and papillary tan tumor implant. The remaining uterine serosa is
smooth. The ectocervical mucosa is white, shiny and flat. The cervix is 2.5 cm in diameter.
The endocervical canal measures 2.5 cm in length and is lined by yellow, flat unremarkable
endocervical mucosa, 1-2 mm in the greatest thickness. The endometrial cavity is 1.8 cm in
height and 1.5 cm in width and is lined by flat, hemorrhagic endometrium 1-2 mm in greatest
thickness with no discrete lesions. A 1.5 x 1 x 1 cm white, firm whorled solid nodule,
well-encapsulated is attached to the lower uterine segment and extends into the parametrial
tissue, grossly consistent with leiomyoma. Multiple sections of the myometrium show no
evidence of additional tumors or invasive carcinoma. The ovaries and fallopian tubes are
not oriented. Each ovary measures approximately 2 x 1 x 1 cm in size. Also each of them
shows, on its surface, towards the lateral fold a 1.5 x 1 x 1 cm polypoid with papillary
tan tumor which appears to be a superficial implant. Each fallopian tube is 5.5 cm in length
and 0.5 to 1.0 cm in diameter. One of the fallopian tubes shows adhesions at its fimbriated
end and is markedly distended, filled with clear fluid, consistent with hydrosalpinx. The
other fallopian tube is distended by a 1.5 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm solid tumor that fills the lumen
in the middle and proximal third. Labeled Cl - anterior cervix/endocervix; C2 - anterior

FS1 - Left ovary mass
- ""Adenocarcinoma"" by
Microscopic Description and Comment: Histologic sections from the left ovarian mass show
a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. The tumor is present predominantly in sheets of
cells with large vesicular nuclei and occasional tumor giant cells. In some areas the
tumor is present in thin single file cords invading a desmoplastic stroma. Other areas show
rhabdoid features with perinuclear eosinophilic cytoplasm. A significant minority of the
tumor forms well-defined endometrioid-type glands. These glands appear to be present in
an adenofibromatous stroma. Metastatic adenocarcinoma extensively involves the lymphatics
of the myometrium but no serosal implants are present. The endometrium has been entirely
submitted and exhibits a disordered proliferative pattern but no carcinoma is identified.
The right ovary (enitrely submitted) and both fallopian tubes are free of carcinoma.
Metastatic adenocarcinoma is present in periappendiceal soft tissue. The appendix also
contains a focal mucocele but no carcinoma involving epithelium is present. Metastatic
adenocarcinoma is present in 2 of 2 right external iliac lymph nodes, 2 of 2 right obturator
lymph nodes, lof 2 left external iliac lymph nodes, 2 of 6 left obturator lymph nodes, 2 of
2 right peri-aortic lymph nodes, and 1 of 1 left peri-aortic lymph nodes. One right common

Comment: Papillary serous adenocarcinoma extensively involves the 25 cm right ovary and
fallopian tube. The left fallopian tube contains a nodule of adenocarcinoma which invades
through the fallopian tube wail to invade the serosal surface. Areas of fallopian tube
epithelium adjacent to this nodule show focal in situ carcinoma. The endometrium exhibits
several apparently discrete fcci of morphologically identical superficial papillary serous
adenocarcinoma without direct myometrial invasion but with extensive lymphvascular space
invasion. Superficial foci of papillary serous adenocarcinoma are present in the lower
uterine segment; one is present adjacent to high endocervix. Papillary serous adenocarcinoma
also involves the cul-de-sac biopsy, the omentum (five small nodules measuring 1 cm in
greatest dimension), one of three right obturator lymph nodes, three of five left external
iliac lymph nodes, two of three right external iliac lymph nodes, and one of one para-aortic
lymph nodes. Three left obturator lymph nodes are free of carcinoma.
in cases ,suchas this one, where morphologically identical papillary serous carcinoma is
present in multiple sites it is
iffic Lt to determine which site is the primary one or whether there are multiple primary
etes. The extensive involvement of one ovary, a eelatively discrete lesion in the fallopian
tube with a focal area of adjacent in, situ carcinoma, and multiple foci in the endometriu:n
.with no myometrial invasion suggest synchronous primary sites. The presence of extensive
lymphvascular space invasion in the myometrium, however, could provide a mechanism for spead
of an endometrial primary.
History: The patient is a year old woman with a right adn.exal mass and an enlarged uterus.
operative procedure: Examination under anesthesia, exploratory laparotomy, Octal abdominal

Description and Comment: Histologic sections of the invasive 
both the right and left ovaries show predominantly a papilla~y serous 
pattern. In several foci, the papillae are fused so that solid sheets of cells are seen. In 
one focus in the left ovary, the tumor is composed of sheets of cells with variably cleared 
cytoplasm. These latter elements also focally exhibit spindled featuresi nonetheless, we 
regard them as most consistent with a minor clear cell component. Other foci of the tumor 
exhibit mucinous features with irregular nests, glands and clusters of neoplastic mucinous 
epithelial cells resting in mucin pools. In many of the metastatic foci, including the 
gastrocolic omentum, the rectosigmoid nodule, the bladder serosa, and in both fallopian 
tubes, this latter component is conspicuous. Irrespective of the histologic pattern that 
predominates in any given location, ps~omatous calcification in invariably present. Tumor 
is also present on the posterior serosal surface of the uterus and in the posterior uterine 
peritoneal reflection. It is possible that this tumor may have arisen in an extra-mullerian 
site; however, despite the unusual mucinous elements in this tumor, we believe that this 
process is best interpreted as a primary ovarian papillary serous carcinoma with multifocal 
intraabdominal spread and lymph nodal metastasis. Recognition of the mucinous elements in 
this case is important, because of that metastases with contain 
or be dominated by. this pattern has reviewed this case and 
agrees \,lith this interpretation.

Microscopic Descri ption and Comment:There is widespread, Poorly differentiated
adenocarcinoma in this case. In many areas, theatumorrgrows as
small solid nests, although there is also considerable epithelial
tufting and micropapillary formation.The great bulk of tumor isextra-ovarian with extensive replacement of the omentum and
involvement of the posterior cul-de-sac, enterocele sac, and
peri-hepatic soft tissue.The latter biopsy, submitted as ""liver

included in the sample. The ovaries are small and of normalconfiguration.There are multiple small serosal tumor nodules and
involvement of parovarian soft tissue. Each ovary contains a
focus of cortical involvement measuring 4 mm and 7 mm (left and
right ovaries respectively) in maximum dimension. By
criteria, this degree of cortical involvement (any nodule
exceeding 5 mm in diameter) would be considered consistent with anovarian primary.
Foci of metastatic papillary serous adenocarcinoma are identified
on the uterine serosa. There is a small focus of tumor in the
posterior para-vaginal soft tissue.The endometrium is inactive.There are no significant histoooathologic abnormalities in the
myometrium or cervix.

Microscopic Description and Comment: 
There is widespread, poorly differentiated papillary serous 
adenocarcinoma in this case. In many areas, the tumor grows as 
small solid nests, although there is also considerable epithelial 
tufting and micropapillary formation. The great bulk of tumor is 
extra-ovarian with extensive replacement of the omentum and 
involvement of the posterior cul-de-sac, enterocele sac, and 
peri-hepatic soft tissue. The latter biopsy, submitted as ""liver 
biopsy"" consists only of soft tissue; no liver parenchyma is 
included in the sample. The ovaries are small and of normal 
configuration. There are multiple small serosal tumor nodules and 
involvement of parovarian soft tissue. Each ovary contains a 
focus of cortical involvement measuring 4 rom and 7 rom (left and 
right ovaries respectively) in maximum dimension. By III 
criteria, this degree of cortical involvement (any no&Ure 
exceeding 5 rom in diameter) would be considered consistent with an 
ovarian primary. 
Foci of metastatic papillary serous adenocarcinoma are identified 
on the uterine serosa. There is a small focus of tumor in the 
posterior para-vaginal soft tissue. The endometrium is inactive. 
There are no significant 
myometrium or cervix. â€¢â€¢â€¢ â€¢â€¢â€¢ â€¢ â€¢â€¢â€¢ 11_ "" A â€¢â€¢

3.5 cm mediolateraly, 2.5 cm anteroposteriorly, and weighs 
approximately SO grams. The peritoneal reflection is greyish-pink 
and irregularly nodular anteriorly and posteriorly. The 
endometrial cavity measures 4 x 1.2 em and is of a uniform 
pinkish-red color. The myometrium is grossly unremarkable and has 
an average thickness of approximately 1.1 cm. The cervix measures 
4 x 2.5 x 2.5 cm. The mucosal surface is greyish-white and 
grossly unremarkable. There is a slit-like os, which measures 
approximately 1.0 cm in diameter. The endocervical canal is 
grossly unremarkable. The attached anterior and posterior vaginal 
tissue measures approximately 1.5 x 1.5 x 0.5 and 6.0 x 5.0 x 0.6

Gross Description; 
The specimens are received in two containers of formalin, each 
labelled with the patient's name. The first is labelled ""uterus, 
cervix, both tubes and ovaries,"" It contains an hysterectomy 
specimen vlith attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and 
ovaries. The uterus measures 8.5 x 5.0 x 4.5 em in greatest 
dimension and has a smooth, unremarkable serosal surface. The 
cervix measures 3.0 em in length and 3.0 em in greatest diameter 
and contains a circular as measuring 0.3 em in greatest diameter. 
The uterus is bivalved in the coronal plane to show an 
unremarkable endocervical canal measuring 2.5 em in length and 0.3 
em in greatest diameter. The endometrial cavity is smooth, 
tan-vlhite, and measures 2.0 cm x 3.0 cm. It shows a polyp 
measuring 3.5 x 1.4 x 0.5 cm. which appears to have filled the 
majority of the endometrial cavity. The polyp is attached by a 
thin stalk (measuring 0.3 em in greatest diameter) to the 
posterior aspect of the endometrial cavity. The right fallopian 
tube measures 4.0 em in length and 0.5 cm in greatest diameter. It 
is densely adherent to an irregular multilobulated firm, white 
mass which is grossly suspicious for tumor and measures 3.0 x 2.0 
x 1.5 em in greatest dimension. This mass is partially adherent to 
the presumed normal ovary whieh measures 2.3 x 1.2 x 1.0 em. 
The mass appears to grossly invade the fallopian tube but not the 
ovary. The left fallopian tube measures 4.0 cm in length and 0.5 
em in greatest diameter. It is externally grossly unremarkable. 
However, on sectioning, a firm, white nodule measuring 1.5 em in 
greatest dimension is noted directly adjacent to the tube. 
However, it does not grossly appear to invade the fallopian tube. 
The left ovary is firm, yellow-white, and multilobulated, 
measuring 4.5 x 3.0 x 3.5 em. The ovary appears to have had tissue 
excised prior to receipt. On cross section, the ovary is solid, 
firm, white t'i'ith an area of central degeneration measuring 1.0 x 
2.0 x 0.5 cm in greatest dimension. The ovarian serosa is smooth 
and the tumor appears grossly contained by it. Labelled

Microscopic Description and Comment:
A poorly differentiated papillary serous adenocarcinoma is seen
arising from the left ovary. The tumor subtotally replaces the
left ovary with prominent lymphovascular space involvement.
Metastatic serous adenocarcinoma is seen in the omentum with the
largest implant measuring 17 cm in greatest dimension. Tumor
implants are identified on the uterine serosa, pelvic soft tissue
and peritoneum as well. Tumor is identified on the serosal surface
of the right fallopian tube. The right ovary, endometrium,
cervix, and left fallopian tube are free of tumor. The nodule
noted grossly on the right ovary proved to represent corpora
albicans histologically. The right fallopian tube demonstrates
scarring with dystrophic calcification as evidence of chronic
inflammation. Exuberant squamous metaplasia is seen in the
cervix. Benign leiomyomas are identified within the myometrium.
The endometrium is atrophic. The additionally submitted appendix

Microscopic Description and Comment: 
Histologic sections from both ovaries show poorly differentiated 
adenocarcinoma of mixed epithelial type. The majority of the 
tumor is composed of solid nests with poorly differentiated, 
focally pleomorphic and multinucleated cells. In areas, definite 
papillary serous differentiation is identified. Other areas show 
back-to-back glandular structures diagnostic of endometrioid 
carcinoma. In many of these glandular areas, the central lumina 
are filled with mucin-type material. Metastatic adenocarcinoma 
with identical histologic features are present in both fallopian 
tubes, on the serosal surface of the uterus with extension into 
myometrium, in deep cervical soft tissue, and in right parovarian 
soft tissue. A single 2 mm. nodule of metastatic adenocarcinoma 
is present in the omentum. Both specimens of peri-aortic lymph 
node contain metastatic adenocarcinoma of identical histology.

grey-tan nodule, compatible with tumor. 
The fourth container is labeled Â·uterus, cervix, BSO."" It consists of a 92 gram, 7.5 x 
4 x 3 em uterus with attached bilateral adnexae. The serosa of the uterus, except for the 
presence of a subserosa I leiomyoma, is smooth and unremarkable. The ectocervix measures 
3.5 em in greatest diameter and is covered by a grey-tan, slightly hemorrhagic mucosa. 
The endocervix is 2.5 em in length and has a slightly mucoid, yellow, mucosa that is free 
of tumor. The endometrial cavity measures 2.5 x 1.5 em and has an unremarkable tan-yellow 
mucosa. The myometrium is composed of a coarsely trabeculated musculature, that, except for 
the presence of a circumscribed, white, whorled, 7 rom leiomyoma is grossly unremarkable. 
The right ovary has previously been opened. It measures approximately 3 x 2 x 2 em and 
is apparently largely replaced by a unilocular cyst. The cyst contains a single solid 
tan-yellm., papillary area measuring 1.0 em in greatest dimension and covering less than 
10% of the total cyst surface area. The remaining surface area is smooth, glistening and 
unremarkable. The right fallopian tube measures 4.5 em in length and has fimbria at the 
distal end. There are three small tumor nodules in the para tubal soft tissues that measure 
Page2of4 
 up to 8 rom in greatest dimension. The tube, appears grossly free of tumor. The left adnexal 
structures are ill-defined grossly, due to the presence of numerous hemorrhagic adhesions. 
There appears to be a portion of ovary that measures 2 x 1 x 0.4 em. There are nodular 
excrescences on the surface .but these appear to represent hemorrhagic exudate. Sectioning of 
the ovary shows a normal-appearing grey-white stroma, without gross evidence of tumor. There 
is also a distorted portion of fallopian tube that has fimbria distally and appears grossly 
uninvolved by tumor. Labeled Dl, anterior cervix; D2, anterior endomyometrium; D3, posterior

a poorly differentiated * 
and Comment: Histologic sections from the left ovarian mass show 
Mullerian adenocarcinoma. The majority of the tumor is present 
in solid sheets and nests: Some of the tumor, however, exhibits definite glandular 
differentiation with occasional areas of back to back glands diagnostic of endometrioid 
differentiation. Other areas exhibit intraluminal complexity in the form of papilla with 
markedly pleomorphic nuclei and numerous atypical mitotic figures consistent with serousÂ· 
differentiation. Metastatic adenocarcinoma is present in and around the left fallopian tube, 
in a small nodule in the right mesovarium, extensively involving the serosal aspect of the 
uterus and deep paracervical tissue 1;'lith superficial invasion of overlying myometrium, in 
the omentum, on the serosal aspect of the appendix, in a mesenteric nodule, in a sigmoid 
nodule, and in the pelvis. A segment of the sigmoid colon has been resected. This segment is 
unoriented but one resection margin exhibits metastatic adenocarcinoma. ----
History: The patient is a pelvic mass.  now undergoes evaluation

first is further It conta'ins a 1 x 1 x 1 em aggregate of 
friable tan tissue. 
The second container is further designated ttuterus, cervix, BSO."" It contains a 200 
gram uterine corpus with attached adnexae and attached cervix. The left adnexa is largely 
replaced by a 7 x 4 x 4 em friable tan tumor mass. The tumor has a finely papillary 
appearance. Attached to the tumor is a 3 em in diameter smooth-lined cyst. Grossly, the 
tumor appears to be adhesed and possibly invading the serosal surface of the left uterine 
corpus. The fallopian tube, which meaSures 3 em in length and 1 em in diameter appears to 
be uninvolved, although it is adherent to the tumor mass. The right adnexa consists of 
a 2 x 1.5 x 0.8 ern firm white and tan ovary with multiple corpora albicans and a 4 em in 
length and 0.8 cm in diameter fallopian tube. There does not appear to be any evidence 
of tumor in the fallopian tube or the ovary; however, in the mesovarium, there is a 0.5 
em firm white nodule. The uterine corpus which measures 4.5 em superior-inferior, 4 cm 
cornu-cornu, and 4.5 em anterior-posterior is adhesed to the left ovarian mass. Furthermore, 
there are multiple nodules of tumor studding the serosal surface. The endometrial cavity 
measures 2.5 x 2 ern with an endometrial thickness of 0.2 cm. The endometrium sounds to a 
depth of 8 ern. The endometrial lining is remarkable for a 2 x 2 x 1 em polyp protruding into 
the endometrial cavity. Sectioning of the pol:yp reveals a central core with a firm \Â·;hite 
lobulated appearance, measuring 2 x 1.2 x 0.5 cm. The core of this polyp appears to arise 
from the underlying myometrium and' is consistent with a submucosal leiomyoma protruding 
into the lumen of the cavity with an intact endometrial lining overlying the leiomyoma. 
There are also other intramural and subserosal unremarkable leiomyomas present, ranging 
from 1 cm in greatest dimension to 1.6 crn in greatest dimension. The myometrium is 2,cm 
in thickness anteriorly and 1.4 cm in thickness posteriorly. The cervix, which measures 
3 crn in length and 3 em in diameter with a round os measuring 0.5 cm in diameter, appears 
to be unremarkable without evidence of papillary formations, masses or nodules. Labeled B1

***Report Electronically Reviewed and Signed Out By 
Intraoperative Consultation: 
FS1: Omentum biopsy _ 
-""Poorly differentiated carcinoma "",ith papillary features, II 
FS2: Upper abdominal mass 
-""Pancreatic tissue with pseudocyst,"" 
and Comment: 
The bulk of the tumor in this case is present in the omentum which is largely replaced by 
papillary serous adenocarcinoma. The sigmoid mesentery also contains a small amount of 
papillary serous adenocarcinoma. The ovaries and endometrium have been entirely submitted 
for histologic evaluation. A small amount of papillary serous adenocarcinoma is present on 
the left ovary (2 mm) and in left paraovarian soft tissue. Sections of both fallopian tubes 
show numerous, small, detached fragments of adenocarcinoma in the lumens but no invasive 
carcinoma is present in either tube. A single, small focus of in situ adenocarcinoma 
is present in the right fallopian tube. Sections of endometrium show a single focus of 
endometrial intraepithelial carcinoma involving a single gland (slide E14). No invasive 
serous carcinoma was present in the endometrium. The pancreatic biopsy shows a pseudocyst 
with surrounding chronic pancreatitis and a small amount of islet cell hyperplasia. No 
pancreatic carcinoma is identified. 
In summary, I believe this case is best classified as primary peritoneal papillary serous 
carcinoma with small foci of in-situ serous carcinoma involving the fallopian tube and 
endometrium. Others have raised the possibility that even non-invasive serous carcinoma in 
the endometrium may be the source of extrauterine spread.

Microscopic Description and Comment: 
Sections show diffuse involvement of the omentum by high-grade serous carcinoma with numerous psammoma bodies 
identified. No endocervical, endometrial, or ovarian parenchymal tumor is Identified. The serous carcinoma is identified 
on the serosal surface of the uterus, with myometrial invasion, on the serosal surface of both fallopian tubes, on the 
serosal surface of the left ovary, in the bladder peritoneum, In the serosal and subserosal tissue of the terminal ileum, 
and in the serosal and subserosal tissue of the appendix. We understand that intraoperatively no obvious primary 
tumor mass was identified although extensive omental caking and peritoneal tumor implants were seen, and that 
clinically a primary peritoneal carcinoma was likely. Overall, the pathologic findings are also consistent with a 
high-grade primary peritoneal serous adenocarcinoma.

diameter. It appears to have been. previously ligated. The serosal surface contains a yellow-tan, nodular tumor Implant 
measuring 2.4 x 2.8 x 2.4 em, It is located at the distal end of the fallopian tube and Involves the fimbria. The cystic 
ovarian mass appears to be separate from the fallopian tube. A remnant of the ovary is not grossly identifiable. There is 
an additional segment of fal/oplan tube noted measuring 1 em in length with a diameter of 0.4 em. It has a pinpoint 
lumen and contains no lesions. Serial sectioning through the remainder of the fallopian tube reveals tumor within the 
lUmen contiguous with the previously described tumor Implant on the surface of the fallopian tube. Proximal to the 
tumor, the fallopian tube appears somewhat dilated and filled with serosanguineous fluid. The lumen measures up to 
0.6 cm in diameter. Also present within the container is a white tissue casseHe labeled ""FS1.-It contains fragments of 
tan-yellow soft tissue, measuring 2.2 x 1.5 x 0.2 cm in aggregate. 
Labeled: Al -remnant of FS1; A2 to A4, nodular thickened area of cyst wall, entirely submitted; A5, the other nodule 
located within the cyst wall, possibly representing round ligament; A6, probable fibrous adhesions on surface of cyst;

paraovarian tissue. 
The second container is labeled nright tube and ovary, uterus, and cervix.Â· It contains a uterus and cervix with attached 
proximal portion of right fallopian tube. The uterus and cervix measure 7 cm from fundus to tip of cervix x 6.3 cm from 
cornu to cornu x 6 cm from anterior to posterior. The serosal surface of the uterus is tan-pink to purple. There are 
possible tumor implants noted on the posterior right aspect of the fundus, measuring 2.3 x 1.5 x 004 cm. The anterior 
and posterior fundic aspects of the uterus are nodular due to the presence of subserosal and intramural probable 
leiomyomas. The cervix measures 3.5 x 3.4 x 3.4 cm. The left and posterior parametria appear to contain tumor 
implants, measuring up to 3.7 x 2,3 x 3 cm. A portion of the peritoneal lining over the posterior aspect of the uterus and 
parametria has been partially pulled away from the parametria and uterus. There is redundant peritoneal tissue which 
may actually be a portion of a cystic structure which has been previously opened. The exact size of this possible cystic 
structure cannot be determined. This portion of redundant peritoneal tissue vs cyst wall tissue measures 3 cm In 
greatest dimension with a thickness measuring up to 0.3 cm. The ectocervix measures 3.4 x 3 x 4 em and Is tan-pink to 
purple and unremarkable. The cervical os is slit-like and measures -0.7 em, The uterus and cervix are opened to 
reveal an endometrial cavity measuring 2 x 3 cm. The endometrial cavity is somewhat deformed due to the presence of 
a submucosal, probable leiomyoma within the anterior superior segment as well as other intramural and subserosal 
leiomyomas. These leiomyomas range in size from 1.5 to 3.5 em in greatest dimension. They have discrete borders 
and tan-white, whorled cut surfaces. The endometrial mucosa is tanÂ·pink to red without lesions and measures up to 1 
mm in thickness. The endocervical canal measures 2.7 x 0.7 cm with tan-white mucosa with a herringbone contour. 
Also present within the container is an ovary with attached segment of fallopian tube. The presumed right ovary is 
previously disrupted with an opening in the serosa with readily observable tumor. Though it Is rather difficult to 
reconstruct the original dimensions of the ovary, the ovary appears to measure 6 x 3.5 x 304 cm. The serosal surface is 
tan, grey, purple, and pink and yellow. There may be possible tumor implants on the serosa which measure <1 mm in 
height. Sectioning through the right ovary reveals solid tumor making up 50% of the ovary as well as a cyst measuring 
2.5 cm in diameter. The cyst is tmed with tan-yellOW to grey, papillary excrescences along with blood. The more solid 
component has a variegated, tan-grey and yellow cut surface. The right fallopian tube measures 5.4 cm in length with a 
diameter ranging from 0.5 to 2 em at the fimbriated end. The serosal surface Is tan-grey to purple and unremarkable. 
Sectioning the fallopian tube reveals a pinpoint lumen with a wall thickness measuring up to 0.2 cm. The tumor does 
not appear to Involve the fallopian tube grossly. There are multiple paratubal cysts ranging in size from 0.4 to 0.7 cm in 
diameter located between the fallopian tube and the ovarian mass. The cysts have a smooth inner lining and contain 
clear fluid. Also present within the container are multiple fragments of grey-tan, soft tissue fragments with ragged 
surfaces, measuring 3.5 x 3.5 x 1.5 cm in aggregate. They are sectioned to show yellow-tan and grey, variegated cut 
surfaces similar to the tumor previously described in other areas. There is a round, hard structure with a tan-white and 
purple surface measuring 1.2 x 0,8 x 0.8 cm. It is sectloned to show a tan-yellow, variegated cut surface. Also present 
within the container are fragments of possible serosal tissue vs cyst wall, measuring 3.7 x 3.5 x 0.4 cm in aggregate. 
They are sectioned to show grey, as well as grey, yellow, variegated cut surfaces. Also present within the container is a 
fragment of yellow, maroon, and grey, fibrofatty soft tissue measuring 4.7 x 3.5 x 1 em. Within this tissue one possible 
lymph node Is identified measuring 3.9 x O.S x 0.5 cm.

consists of a uterus, ""lith dimensions consistent with those in intraoperative consultation, 
attached cervix, measuring 3 x 3 x 2.5 em, left and right fallopian tubes, measuring 6.5 
em and 6 em, respectively, and left and right ovaries measuring 3 x 2.5 x 1 em each. The 
specimen has been previously bivalved for fixation. The external surface of cervix and 
uterus shows irregular adhesions. No recognizable vaginal cuff or parametrial tissue is 
present. The ectocervix measures 3 x 1 em anteriorly, and 3.5 x 1.5 ern posteriorly. The 
reconstituted os is somewhat irregular, measuring 0.5 em. An area of hemorrhage, otherwise 
smooth is noted along the posterior ectocervix measuring 1 x 1 em in extent. The cervical 
canal measuring 2.5 em in length shows mucus. A slight irregularity is noted along the 
anterior endocervical canal with attached mucus, measuring 1 x 1.2 cm. The endometrial 
Page2of4 
 cavity is triangular and measures 2.5 x 2 em. The anterior and posterior endomyometrium 
is diffusely thickened with a smooth, trabeculated appearance. The anterior endomyometrium 
measures 2.3 em in thickness and the posterior endomyometrium measures 2.7 em in the 
maximally thickened area. The endometrial-myometrial interface is grossly obliterated. The 
left adnexal structures are congested and edematous in appearance. Adhesions are grossly 
identified with some firm areas. The fimbriated end of the left fallopian tube is grossly 
obliterated and shows a soft, grey-white nodule, measuring 0.3 em in immediate vicinity. 
The left ovary, although not grossly enlarged, has a nodular, granular outer surface with 
areas showing exudate. The cut surface is also somewhat nodular and firm. No gross extension 
of tumor into the meso-ovarian or adjacent, middle-third of fallopian tube is noted. The 
right fallopian tube is thickened along the middle~third with serosal congestion and exudate 
on the surface. The fimbriated end is obliterated and somewhat firm. There are areas of 
congestion and firnmess "",ith exudate-like deposits in the left adnexal soft tissue. The

Hicroscopic Description and Cormnent: poorly differentiated papillary serous adenocarcinoma 
extensively replaces the omentum, is present on the serosal surfaces of the appendix, 
uterus, both ovaries and both fallopian tubes and involves the specimens labelled Â·colonic 
implant"" and asmall bowel implant. II Both ovaries have been entirely submitted and no 
significant cortical involvement is identified. The endometrium exhibits cystic atrophy but 
is free of carcinoma. The myometrium contains several leiomyomas, the largest measuring 0.3 
cm. Because the bulk of the tumor is present in the omentum and peritoneal locations and the 
totally submitted ovaries exhibit only a a small amount of tumor on the serosal surfaces, 
this tumor is best classified as a primary peritoneal papillary serous adenocarcinoma. 
 
History: The patient is a with a history of breast carcinom~ 
 now has malignant a mass. Operative procedure: Examination under 
anesthesia, exploratory laparotomy, omentectomy, appendectomy, total abdominal hysterectomy,

"," Site: Right and left ovary
Laterality: Right and left
Histology: Serous adenocarcinoma
Stage: T3a (Microscopic peritoneal metastasis beyond true pelvis < 2 cm)
Grade: G3 (Poorly-differentiated)
Behavior: Malignant

Justification: The site and laterality of the tumor are provided in the report, with the histology indicating a malignant serous adenocarcinoma. The stage is determined based on the presence of microscopic peritoneal metastasis beyond the true pelvis, which is classified as T3a. The grade is reported as G3, indicating poorly-differentiated tumor cells. The behavior of the tumor is malignant, as it exhibits features of cancer and has spread to other parts of the body.

Some information such as regional lymph node metastases, detailed staging information, and status of distant metastasis sites are not provided in the report, so they cannot be classified accurately.",,,,,,,,,

COMMENT 
Poorly differentiated papillary serous adenocarcinoma completely 
replaces the right ovary and is present on the surface of the 
right ovary. The right fallopian tube is not identified and may 
have been completelyreplaced by adenocarcinoma. Small implants of 
papillary Berous adenocarcinoma are present in peri tubal tissue in 
the left fallopian tube and within adhesions in the left ovary. 
Metastatic papillary serous adenocarcinoma also involves the 
ser06al surface of the appendix and the omE>Q.turn. The endometrium

COMMENT 
Both the right and lett ovaries are replaced by a poorly 
differentiated papillary serous adenocarcinoma. The tumor shows a 
predominant papillary and cribriform architecture but also SllOWS 
significant areas of solid proliferation. Cystic areas lined by 
tla~tened layers of tumor cells are also present. The tumor cells 
a.re large with marked cellular, and nuclear pleomorphism, and, 
moderate amounts of granular eosinophilic cytoplasm. Mitotic 
figures are numerous and ioci of necrosis are easily identifiau. 
Focal areas also show clear cell differentiation. 
--4-- -: , 
""'~-"" 0: .. Surg. Path. No.: 
The tumor grossly and microscopically involved the surfaces at the 
ovaries, the mesovarium, and microscopically also involved the 
left fallopian tube. The thickened areas on the uterine serosa 
noted grossly represented foci of metastatic tumor. Many of the 
regional lymph nodes were replaced by tumor, and some of the 
nodules showed no identifiable residual lymph node tissue, and may 
represent soft tissue metastases.

enlarged nuclei and multinucleated forms are present, and atypical

serous adenocarcinoma that predominantly inv.olves the ovarian 
surfaces. The largest nodule in the ovary measues 0.7 em in 
greatest dimension. The ovaries otherwise oontain numerous benign 
cysts lined by serous or flattened cuboidal epitheliv~. Serosal 
involvement of both fallopian tubes are present. 
The hysterectomy specimen shows patchy serosal involvement by 
serous papillary carcinoma and foci of intralymphatic tumor in the 
cervix. Benign endocervial polyps, a 1 em endometrial polyp, and 
a 1.5 em submucosal leiomyoma and mUltiple intramural leiomyomata are also noted. 
In summary, although both ovaries are involved by serous papillary 
adenocarcinoma, the ovaries are not markedly enlarged, and show 
predominantly surface involvement. The bulk of the tumor appears 
to involve the pelvis and peritoneum, and raises the possibility 
of a primary peritoneal origin of the tumor ,~ith metastatic 
involvement of the ovaries. There is no evidence of metastatic colonic or breast carcinoma. ---------------------------------- -----

COMMENT 
There is extensive involvement of both ovaries, bot fallopian 
tubes, the uterus and cervix, bladder serosa, and the omentum by 
poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. The most ext~nsive tumor 
burden is in the ovaries, one or both of which represent primary 
sites. In the left ovary, the tumor displays two di~tinctive 
histologic types (best demonstrated in slides LOI a d L02). In 
some areas, the histologic pattern is distinctly en ometrioid with 
well-formed glands displaying central lumina. The s~cond 
histologic type, which represents the majority of t~e tumor, is 
that of a high grade poorly differentiated adenocar9inoma, most 
likely representing a papillary serous adenocarcino~a. Both 
ovaries also contain adenofibromas. It is this poorlw ' 
differentiated papillary serous component which rep~esents the ' 
,biologically aggreSfdv:.e_c,omponent_oL.the neoplasm,Â·-al ,it, is the' 
----~ sole histologic subtype in all the metastatic sites. The right 
ovary shows extensive invasion by poorly differentia ed 
adenocarcinoma. Both fallopian tubes contain serosal implants of 
metastatic poorly differentiated carcinoma, as well s submucosal 
invasion of tumor nests. While the majority of the ndometrial 
epithelium is composed of cytologically bland atroph~c glands, 
admixed among the normal elements are islands and nehts of 
metastatic poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma Whict is indistinguishable from the, ovarian tumor. It is not possible to 
determine with certainty whether the endometrial car,inoma is a 
second, synchronous primary or metastatic from the oyaries. The 
entire thickness of the myometrial wall displays numerous 
intravascular metastases of adenocarcinoma, and numetous uterine 
serosal implants of tumor are also seen. Extensive s' mucosal 
invasive nests and intravascular metastases are also identified in

Justification: The patient has a primary tumor involving the right ovary and endometrium, with metastases to multiple sites including both fallopian tubes, uterine serosa, and extensive intravascular involvement. The tumor is described as poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, which suggests high-grade malignancy.

"," Site: The primary tumor is located in the left ovary, with possible involvement in the right ovary, omentum, endometrium, fallopian tube, sigmoid colon, and gastrocolic omentum.
Laterality: Tumors are present in the left and possibly the right ovary.
Histology: The tumor is a high-grade serous carcinoma.
Stage: Based on the information provided, the tumor can be classified as FIGO stage III or higher due to extensive metastases.
Grade: The nuclear grade of the tumor is G3, indicating poor differentiation.
Behavior: The tumor is malignant, as widespread carcinoma is found in the submitted specimens.

Not provided: Some information necessary for a complete pathology report, such as the FIGO grade and the examination of all regional lymph nodes, was not provided or could not be determined from the text. Clinical correlation is required to assign the final C/FIGO stage.",,,,,,,,,

Justification: The report consistently refers to a primary tumor in the ovary.

Laterality: Right
Justification: The report specifically mentions a right ovarian tumor.

Histology: High-grade serous carcinoma
Justification: The report describes features consistent with high-grade serous carcinoma, such as poor differentiation and diffuse peritoneal involvement.

Stage: III
Justification: The report mentions that the tumor has spread beyond the ovary, involving the pelvic lymph nodes and omentum, but not the extra-pelvic tissues or distant sites.

Grade: Poorly differentiated (grade 3)
Justification: The report describes the tumor as having poor differentiation, which is consistent with a grade 3 classification.

Behavior: Malignant
Justification: The report consistently refers to the tumor as malignant and identifies it as a neoplasm, indicating its ability to invade surrounding tissues and metastasize.

Note that some important information such as lymphovascular invasion, margins status, and CA-125 levels are not provided in the report, which could be relevant for staging and prognosis.",,,,,,,,,

Gross Description 
The specimens are received in five formalin-filled containers, each labeled 
The first container is labeled ""right ovary, FSl/X.n It 
contains a previously bisected 360 gram tan-yellow ovarian mass. The mass 
measures 12 x 10 x 7 cm. The serosal surface ShOHS numerous bosselations. 
Focally, the capsule is ruptured and at this site the tumor is seen projecting 
to the exterior. Also identified on the ovarian surface is a possible fallopian 
tube measuring 4.5 crn in length and has a luminal diameter of 0.3 crn. The 
fallopian tube grossly appears uninvolved. Further sectioning of the ovarian 
mass shows a tan-yellow firm tumor mass which is solid in most part, but focally 
shows cystic change and the inner surface of the cyst wall shows papillary 
tan-white projections. Labeled A1 -possible right fallopian tube; A2 to All -
sections through the right ovarian tumor. II1II-----. 
The second container is labeled IIleft adnexa."" It contains portions of 
fallopian tube and with attached tan-yelloH ovarian mass. The fallopian tube 
measures ~.O x 1.1 x 0.8 cm, and the attached ovarian mass measures 6.0 x 6.5 x 
4.0 cm. The mass weighs 60.5 grams. Sections through the fallopian tube show 
portions of the serosal surface involved by the tumor, hOHeverl the mucosa 
appears uninvolved. Part of the ovarian surface appears ragged, while part of 
the ovarian surface is smooth and ShovlS multiple tan-yellow papillary 
excrescences on the surface. Based on the gross examination, it is not possible 
to discern the primary site of the tumor (left ovary vs right ovary). Further 
sectioning of the ovary reveals multiple nodular tan-yellow solid and papillary 
tumors with focal areas of necrosis. Labeled Bl -sections through the 
fallopian tube with the tumor at the serosal aspect; B2 to B8 -random sections 
through the ovarian tumor ........ 
The third container is labeled ""bladder."" It contains three tan-yelloVl to 
tan~pink fat and soft tissue fragments ranging from 2.0 to 5.0 cm in greatest 
Page 2 of 4  dimensions and 5.0 x 5.0 x 2.0 em in aggregate. Sections shm1 multiple 
tan-white to tan-pink nodules consistent with the primary tumor in the ovaries. 
Labeled Cl to C3. I11III 
The fourth contai~ labeled lIabdominal tumor and omentum, It It contains 
multiple tan-yellO\v to tan-pink fatty tissue fragments consistent with portions 
of omentum. The fragments range from 4.0 to 10.0 em in greatest dimensions I and 
15.0 x 13.0 x 6.0 em in aggregate. The largest fragment shows multiple 
tan-white nodules that are matted together to form the omental cake. Sections 
of the mass show tan-whi tumor masses dissecting into the omental 
stroma. Labeled D1 to D4. 
The fifth container is labeled ""uterus."" It contains a uterus and cervix 
weighing 165 grams, and measuring 10.0 x 8.0 x 7.0 em. The uterus is bivalved 
when received. The serosal surface is tan-pink and shows multiple tan-yellow 
nodules with consistency and cut surface similar to the lesions noted in both 
the ovaries, and is grossly consistent for serosal implants. The serosal 
implants range from 0.6 to 4.0 em in greatest dimensions. The uterus is further 
sectioned to show a 2.5 em unremarkable endocervical canal. The endometrial 
cavity measures 3.5 x 2.2 cm. A fundal, calcified intramural leiomyoma is 
identified and measures 3.8 ern in greatest dimensions. The endometrial cavity 
is unremarkable, and does not show any involvement by the ovarian tumor. 
Labeled E1 -posterior cervix with endocervical canal; E2 -posterior lower 
uterine segment; E3 -possible posterior endometrium; E4 -myometrium with 
adjoining serosal tumor implant; E5 -anterior cervix with endocervical canal; 
E6 -possible anterior lower uterine segment; E7 -possible anterior

I ."" ~.,.,'.  \ "," Site: The specimen contains lesions from various sites including the right pelvic wall, right and left ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, and multiple lymph nodes.

Laterality: The laterality of most lesions is on the right side, including the right pelvic wall, right ovary, right fallopian tube, and right-sided lymph nodes. However, there are also lesions in the left ovary, left ovarian hilum, and left-sided lymph nodes.

Histology: The specimen shows various histologic types of lesions, including serous carcinoma, fibroepithelial lesion, and unremarkable lymphoid tissue. The most significant finding is a poorly differentiated papillary serous carcinoma in the right pelvic wall and right ovary.

Stage: The stage of the cancer is not explicitly provided; however, based on the description of the lesions' extent and involvement of lymph nodes, it can be inferred that the cancer is at an advanced stage.

Grade: The grade of the cancer is also not explicitly provided; however, based on the description of the lesion as ""poorly differentiated,"" it can be inferred that the cancer is high-grade.

Behavior: The behavior of the cancer is malignant, as evidenced by its extensive spread and involvement of lymph nodes.

Justification: These six categories are chosen because they provide critical information for understanding the nature and extent of the lesions in the specimen. Site and laterality describe the location of the lesions, which can have implications for treatment and prognosis. Histology provides information about the type and differentiation of the lesion, which is crucial for determining the appropriate treatment and assessing the prognosis. Stage and grade are important indicators of the extent and severity of the cancer, respectively, while behavior describes whether the lesion is benign or malignant.",,,,,,,,,

 SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT 
OVary, right, biopsy -npoorilidifferentiated adenocarcinoma"" by 
Microscopic Description and Comment: 
There is widespread poorly differentiated papillary serOllS 
adenocarcinoma in this case. The tumor is concentrated in the 
right adnexal region, a portion of which was submitted for frozen 
section. There is considerable involvement of the right fallopian 
tube which includes circumferential replacement of the mucosa and 
muscularis with extension through the serosal surface. The normal 
mucosal epithelium is largely obliterated by this process, but 
focally, an in-situ component is identified. There is extensive 
involvement of the peri tubal soft tissue. The right ovary is 
grossly normal in size and configuration. Microscopically, small 
tumor foci are identified on the ovarian surface and within 
scattered lymphvascular spaces. There is one confluent nodule of 
tumor situated in the ovarian hilum and medulla. While it is 
difficult to be absolutely dogmatic when tumor is as widespread as 
in this case, the distribution favors a primary in the fallopian 
tube. Additional foci of tumor are identified on the serosal 
surface of the uterus where there is rrdnimal involvement of 
adjacent myometrium. Small foci of tumor are identified on the 
serosal surface of ,the left ovary and fallopian tube. There is 
rrdnimal involvement of the left tubal fimbria. The endometrium is 
largely atrophic. Scattered clusters of tumor cells are 
identified in lymphatic spaces within the endometrium, and there 
are a few larger confluent foci as well. Clusters of tumor cells 
are identi tied in myometrial lymphatics as well. There is 
extensive involvement of the omentum and of the periappendiceal 
soft tissues. Tumor extend into the outer portions of the 
appendiceal muscularis and is identified in a fe,,, submucosal 
lymphatics. Hetastatic papillary serous adenocarcinoma is also 
identified in the sample from the umbilical hernia sac. There are 
no histopathologic 
epithelium is atrophic. 
History: 
The patient is a -I,oJith a tvlo-month history 
of abdominal dis=tt to be inflammatory bowel 
disease. Abdominopelvic CT revealed 4 cm right adnexal mass, 
retroperitoneal adenopathy, omental caking, moderate ascites, 
right cuI de sac implant, metastatic lymph node at umbilicus. 
Ultrasound shovJed moderate ascites and a 4 cm right adnexal mass. 
Clinical diagnosis: OVarian carcinoma. Operative procedure: 
Examination under anesthesia, exploratory laparotomy, total

ADDENDUM 1: 
Immunostaining for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is performed on sections 
from Block Al (""omental cake"") and Dl (llportion left ovary!!). The 
immunostaining is done using DAKO rabbit anti-human CEA which is lithe purified 
immunoglobulin fraction of rabbit antiserum"" ( ). The 
section from Block Al contains abundant adenocarcinoma with numerous psammoma 
bodies. There is very heterogeneous staining for CEA. There are foci of 
tumor in which all of the cells stain for CEA. Approximately 3/4 of these 
cells have moderately intense staining and 1/4 have markedly intense 
staining. These foci where all of the tumor cells stain comprise only a small 
portion of the tumor. The more common pattern of staining is where there are 
mixtures of positively staining and negatively staining cells adjacent to each 
other. In these areas, approximately 2/3 of the tumor cells stain 
positively. The staining intensity is evenly distributed between mildly 
intense and markedly intense in these areas. Though there is great 
variability in staining for CEA from one region of the tumor to the other, I 
estimate that approximately 50% of the tumor cells exhibit some degree of 
staining for CEA. 
The histological sections of the left ovary also contain abundant tumor for 
evaluation. As with the metastasis to the omentum, the primary tumor exhibits 
marked heterogeneity in staining for CEA. There is one area of the tumor 
where there is necrotic debris and neutrophils between clusters of cancer 
cells. The debris and neutrophils stain positively which is a common 
cross-reaction with this antibody. There is more abundant staining of the 
tumor than was noted in the metastasis. There are many areas in which there 
are positively staining cells adjacent to negatively staining cells. There 
are also areas of the tumor in which many positively stained cells are 
adjacent to each other. The intensity of the tumor cell staining varies 
widely, as was noted in the metastasis. Approximately 40% of the positively 
staining cells exhibit markedly intense staining, 40% exhibit moderately 
intense staining and 20% exhibit mildly intense staining. Overall, I estimate 
that approximately 50% of the tumor cells exhibit expression of 
carcinoembryonic antigen. 
I certify that I personally conducted the diagnostic evaluation of the above 
specimen(s) and have rendered the above diagnosis(es). -29-1690

ADDENDUM 1: 
This addendum is issued to report the results for imrnu~R2/neu 
oncoprotein. The test is performed at the request of ............... 
Irnmunostaining for HER2/neu (c-erbB-2) oncoprotein is performed on recut 
sections of block A2 (""left ovaryll). The irrununostaining is done using DAKO 
rabbit anti-human c-erbB-2 oncoprotein which is an affinity-isolated antibody 
{DAKO product number A0485}. The irnmunostaining is performed after antigen 
retrieval by heating the unstained sections at 95 degrees centigrade for 20 
minutes in 10 roM citrate buffer, pH 6.0. The primary antibody is used at a 
dilution of 1:1500 (manual staining) or 1:2000 {autostainer}, with an 
incubation for one hour at 37 degrees centigrade. The Histostain Plus kit 
(Zymed Laboratories) is used as the detection system. The histological 
section consists predominantly of serous adenocarcinoma with areas of 
papillary differentiation. The tumor has a variable immunostaining profile. 
The majority of the tumor has negligible staining of the cytoplasm or cell 
membrane (score = 0). There is a minority population of the tumor cells that page 2 on  has trace staining of the cytoplasm with mildly to moderately intense 
circumferential staining of the cell membrane. These cells with 
circumferential cell membrane staining are present as multiple foci scattered 
throughout the tumor. This makes it difficult to estimate the overall tumor 
population with the staining pattern indicative of weak overexpression of 
HER2/neu oncoprotein, but I estimate that such cells account for approximately 
5% of the tumor cells. 
In summary, the serous adenocarcinoma present in the left ovary has a 
subpopulation of tumor cells (approximately 5% of the total population) with 
an imrnunostaining profile indicative of mild overexpression of HER2/neu 
oncoprotein. 
I certify that I personally conducted the diagnostic evaluation of the above 
specimen(s) and have rendered the above diagnosis(es).

APPENDIX WITH SEROSAL INVOLVEMENT BY METASTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA. -29-1694 
I certify that I personally conducted the diagnostic evaluation of the above 
specimen (5) and have rendered the above diagnosis(es). 
"," 1. ""Site"": The sites include omentum, right tube and ovary, left tube and ovary, uterus, cervix, pelvic peritoneal, and appendix. These are all pelvic structures.
2. ""Laterality"": The laterality is specified as right for the right tube and ovary and left for the left tube and ovary.
3. ""Histology"": The histology for most sites is metastatic adenocarcinoma, with the exception of the right and left fallopian tubes which are normal. The right ovary has papillary serous adenocarcinoma and the left ovary has papillary serous adenocarcinoma with carcinoma adjacent to the tube.
4. ""Stage"": The stage is not provided in the information given.
5. ""Grade"": The grade of the tumors is not provided in the information given.
6. ""Behavior"": The behavior of the tumors is malignant, as they are adenocarcinomas.

Justification: The diagnosis of metastatic adenocarcinoma was made for several sites including the omentum, pelvic peritoneal, and appendix. Additionally, the right and left ovaries had papillary serous adenocarcinoma. The fallopian tubes were reported as normal in the right side and with carcinoma adjacent to the tube on the left side. No information about stage or grade of the tumors was provided. Adenocarcinomas are malignant by nature, hence the behavior is classified as such.",,,,,,,,,

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION: 
Microscopic examination is perfor:med. 
IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL FINDINGS: 
Sections from the paraffin block are cut at 4-5 micrometers, placed on 
positively-charged glass slides, deparaffinized in organic solvents, treated 
with methanolic H202 to quench endogenous peroxidase activity, and rehydrated. 
Sections are treated with primary antibodies to detect the antigen(s) in 
question, or with non-immune rabbit immunoglobulin(s) or mouse isotype(s) as a 
negative control; appropriate positive tissue controls are also tested. 
Sections are sequentially reacted with biotinylated secondary antibody and 
with streptavidin or avidin-biotin-complex labeled with horseradish 
peroxidase. Immunoreactivity is visualized using diaminobenzidine as the 
chromogen. Counterstaining is performed. The results are as follows: 
Tumor cells are diffusely positive with Ber-EP4 and CA-12S, and focally 
positive with CK5/6. Tumor cells are negative with chromogranin, 
synaptophysin, calretinin, and CD30.

specimen (5) and have rendered the above diagnosis(es). "," 1. ""Site"": Omentum, as the report specifically mentions the omentum as the location of the tumor.
2. ""Laterality"": Not provided, as the report does not specify if the tumor is on the left or right side of the body.
3. ""Histology"": Serous adenocarcinoma, as the report clearly states this as the diagnosis for the omentum tissue.
4. ""Stage"": Not provided, as the report does not include information about the size of the tumor in relation to the surrounding structures or whether it has metastasized to other parts of the body.
5. ""Grade"": Poorly differentiated, as stated in the report for both the omentum and left fallopian tube and ovary.
6. ""Behavior"": Malignant, as the tumor is a cancer and shows signs of spreading to the omentum from another location (poorly differentiated serous adenocarcinoma).",,,,,,,,,
