sectioned and individually submitted labeled A-8. Remaining tissue 
fragments are submitted labeled C. 
Container labeled -left upper lobe"" has a 
. -. e_ .. l' - previously partially ctioned portion of 
recognizable pulmonary parenchyma grossly consistent with left upper 
lobe of lung. The specimen as received weighs 126 grams and measures 
16.7 x 9.5 x 2.9 cm. The margin of resection is bifurcation of the 
tertiary bronchi with an adjacent 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.7 cm fleshy 
gray-black nodule. The pleura is slightly wrinkled gray-pink and 
moderately anthracotic streaked. On the posterior aspect of the mid 
region is a partially sectioned previously inked 3.5 x 3.2 cm area 
of umbilicated induration . The specimen is partially sectioned in 
of 3 
 this region to reveal an underlying 3.5 x 2.9 x up to 1.6 cm 
somewhat fleshy focally gritty gray-tan fibrotic lesion which 
extends to but does not grossly appear to extend through the pleura. 
This is seen at its nearest point 2.3 cm from the nearest bronchial 
margin. An apparent bronchial connection is identified . On 
sectioning , the remaining parenchyma reveals spongy congested 
parenchyma with minimal anthracotiC streaking . No additional gross 
lesions are identified . Also received in the same container are two 
tissue cassettes . The first is a red cassette labeled "" and 
the second is a gray cassette labeled ""good"". Representative 
sections of the tissue are submitted labeled as follows: A -shaved

Comments 
Sections of the tumor show a well differentiated mucinous 
adenocarcinoma . Focally, in one residual bronchus , an area of in 
situ adenocarcinoma is identified. In addition , some subpleural 
fibrosis is present suggesting that this is a primary adenocarcinoma 
as opposed to a metastatic adenocarcinoma. A panel of 
immunohistochemical stains is performed including CK7, CK20, CDX2, 
and TTF1 (with appropriate positive and negative controls). The 
neoplastic cells are strongly positive for CK7. The neoplastic 
cells demonstrate some scattered focal positive stain for CK20. The 
neoplastic cells demonstrate focal weakly positive staining TTF1. 
In addition, the neoplastic cells demonstrate a rare focal positive 
staining cell for CDX2. 
This demonstrates a well differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma. 
The subpleural fibrosis would suggest this represents a primary lung 
neoplasm, however, the immunohistochemical stains are equivocal and 
therefore the possibility of a metastatic lesion cannot be fully 
excluded on histologic grounds alone. Clinical correlation and 
follow up is recommended.

MICROSCOPIC 
A) Sections through the wedge resection from the left upper lobe confirm 
the presence of non-small cell carcinoma. The tumor is predominantly 
composed of solid nests of cells with large vesicular nuclei and abundant 
eosinophilic cytoplasm. Mitotic activity is fairly abundant and areas of 
tumor necrosis are seen. The tumor is predominantly growing in solid nests 
with minimal acinar formation. although occasional foci of both 
intracellular and extracellular mucin are suggested. This lesion abuts but 
does not appear to specifically infiltrate within the overlying visceral 
pleura Assessment in this regard includes an elastic stain on block A6. 
Noninvolved pulmonary parenchyma demonstrates nonspecific emphysematous 
changes but is otherwise unremarkable. A limited immunohistochemical 
evaluation of this lesion is performed with results as follows:  TTF -1: Positive 
_in A: Negative 
Negative 
P63: Limited/focal positivity is seen 
The combination of TTF-1 positivity with apparent focal mucin production by 
this neoplasm would confirm a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. 
B-G) The microscopic appearance substantiates the diagnosis.

Breast,,Invasive carcinoma of no special type (NST) without specific differentiation,T2 N0 Mx,II or III,Malignant,ER-ADRU.pdf,                       ," Report: 
The sample consists of a fragment of neoplastic tissue measuring 3.5 x 2.2 x 1.8 cm. The tumor is composed of nests and cords of relatively uniform cells with moderate amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm and round to oval nuclei containing fine chromatin and inconspicuous nucleoli. The mitotic activity is brisk, approximately 12 mitoses per 10 high power fields. There is focal necrosis present. The tumor shows infiltration into the surrounding fibroadipose tissue. No lymphovascular invasion is identified. Immunohistochemical stains show that the tumor cells are positive for estrogen and progesterone receptors, and negative for HER2/neu. The surgical margins are widely negative.

1. Site: Breast - The report mentions ""a fragment of neoplastic tissue"" but does not provide explicit information about the site; however, the context implies that it is a breast tumor due to the description and immunohistochemical stains for estrogen and progesterone receptors, which are typically performed for breast cancer.

2. Laterality: Not provided - The report does not mention whether the tumor is from the left or right breast.

3. Histology: Invasive carcinoma of no special type (NST), also known as invasive ductal carcinoma, without specific differentiation - This diagnosis is based on the description of nests and cords of relatively uniform cells infiltrating the surrounding tissue, along with the absence of features indicative of a specific subtype.

4. Stage: T2 - Based on the size of the tumor (3.5 cm) and the invasion into the surrounding fibroadipose tissue, it can be classified as T2 according to the TNM staging system for breast cancer. N0, Mx - No information is provided about lymph node involvement or distant metastasis in this report; thus, they are classified as N0 (no regional lymph node metastasis) and Mx (metastasis cannot be assessed).

5. Grade: Grade II or III - The report mentions brisk mitotic activity (12 mitoses per 10 high power fields), focal necrosis, and moderate nuclear atypia; however, it does not provide enough information to definitively classify the tumor as either grade II or III.

6. Behavior: Malignant - This is inherent in the diagnosis of invasive carcinoma, which indicates malignant behavior by definition.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Colon,,Adenocarcinoma,T2N0Mx,II,Malignant,CDDP-ABJZ.pdf,," Report: 
The surgical specimen shows a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma involving the mucosa and submucosa with no evidence of lymphovascular invasion. No regional lymph nodes were removed for examination.

1. ""Site"": Colon. Justification: The report mentions the surgical specimen, and colon adenocarcinoma is the most common type of cancer in this location.
2. ""Laterality"": Not provided. Justification: The report does not mention any laterality information as it refers to the colon without specifying left or right side.
3. ""Histology"": Adenocarcinoma. Justification: The report directly states a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma in the surgical specimen.

The examination of this case material and the preparation of this report were  
performed by the staff pathologist.  
 Note:  
Frozen section diagnoses are confirmed.   Mucicarmine, TTF -1, Napsin A, CK 5/6,  
and p63 were performed on block D4 in conjunction with appropriately reacting  
controls to assess for  glandular and squamous differentiation.   Mucicarmine does  
not show any intracytoplasmic positivity.   The immunohistochemical staining  
results show the tumor cells are diffusely and strongly positive for CK5/6 and  
p63, while negative for TTF -1 and Napsin A . These staining results in  
conjunction with the light microscopic features are consistent with a diagnosis  
of squamous cell carcinoma.

MACROSCOPIC
One specimen received.
The specimen is labelled `L wedge resection lingula' and consists of a wedge
resection of lung measuring in its partially Inflated state 115 x 90 x 35 mm.
A staple line is present at the proximal margin measuring 85 mm in length. The
pleural surface contains two separate ragged/indurated areas .The largest
measures 35 x 25 mm and Is roughened. The second smaller area measures 17 mm
in greatest dimension and has a punched out full thickness defect in the
pleura. The pleura surrounding these roughened areas shows diffuse thickening.
The cut surface shows a pleural-based. peripheral tumour. It has an ill-defined
outline with prominent adjacent collapse and consolidation. The tumour
measures approximately 35 x 31 x 19 mm. It appears to directly Involve the two
disrupted pleural surfaces described previously. The tumour lies. 15 mm from
the nearest surgical resection margin. The cut surface of the rest of the lung
parenchyma shows extensive obstructive changes. There are small firm nodules
within this ranging In size from 1 to 5 mm In. greatest dimension. They may
represent separate tumour foci. There Is also mild emphysema. [1A-1B, tumour
including resection margin ;1C-ID, RS tumour adjacent to smaller full thickness
pleural defect; 1E, RS tumour adjacent to intact pleura next to small defect;
1F, RS tumour adjacent to larger full thickness pleural defect; 1G, RS possible
separate tumour foci within consolidation; 1H, RS relatively normal lung.]
MICROSCOPIC
Sections show a moderately differentiated keratinising squamous cell carcinoma.
it shows areas of necrosis and is associated with a florid Inflammatory
response. Invasion of the visceral pleura is confirmed and carcinoma is
present on the inked surface of the disrupted pleura. The stapled. surgical
resection margin is well clear of malignancy. Tumour surrounds and compresses
a number of blood vessels, and there is focal vascular invasion. No lymphatic
or perineural invasion is identified. The surrounding lung is confirmed to
show organising obstructive pneumonitis. The nodules noted macroscopically
appear to represent foci of bronchiectasis, organising pneumonia and localised
subpleural honeycomb change. No tumour is identified within these areas.
There is interstitial fibrosis in these areas and there are a few foci of
fibroblastic proliferation reminiscent of the fibroblastic foci of UIP; however
the section of normal appearing lung shows only emphysema with no features to
suggest an established interstitial pneumonitis. No lymph nodes are included.
SUMMARY
Lingulectomy:
Moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, 35 mm in diameter.
Pleural Invasion present with disruption and tumour on pleural surface. Vascular invasion present.
No lymphatic or perineural invasion identified.
No lymph nodes included.

HISTORY
Lobectomy for carcinoma.
MACROSCOPIC
Six specimens are received.17113
1: The first specimen Is labelled ""R middle lobe, R lower lobe, R upper lobe""
and consists of right middle and lower lobes with a small stapled wedge of
upper lobe superiorly. The specimen measures 165 x 75 x 45 mm with the stapled
wedge of upper lobe measuring 70 x 30 x 30 mm. There is a firm mass with
overlying pleural adhesions at the apical aspect of the lower lobe, measuring
52 x 50 x 35 mm. On sectioning, the mass has a pale sclerotic appearance and
is centrally cavitated. The cavity measures 12 mm across. The tumour extends
to apparently Involve the lateral pleural surface and It extends close to the
pleura on the medial aspect. In this region it extends into a bronchus. There
is possible involvement of the upper lobe but the tumour appears well clear of
the stapled upper lobe resection margin. No other focal lesions are identified
on sectioning and there are no other endobronchial lesions. [Bronchial and
vascular resection margin, 1A; peribronchial lymph nodes, 1B; tumour with
overlying pleura, 1C-1E; tumour and upper lobe resection margin, IF; tumour and
medial surface of lung, 1G; further section, 11-1; tumour and proximal bronchus,
1I; random section of lung, 13.]
2: The second specimen Is labelled ""upper lobe lymph node ""and consists of two
pieces of lymph node ,17 x 15 x 7 mm and 15 x 11 x 8 mm .[Each piece bisected
and blocked in toto, 2A]
3: The third specimen is labelled ""No. 11 lymph node"" and consists of three
pieces of tissue measuring 18 x 15 x 8 mm in aggregate. [Largest: piece
bisected and all tissue wrapped and blocked in toto, 3A]
4: The Fourth specimen is labelled ""No. 7 lymph node"" and consists o fpieces of
fatty tissue measuring 45 x 30 x 15 mm in aggregate .[BIT, 4A-46]
5: The fifth specimen Is labelled ""No. 8 lymph node"" and consists of a piece of
lymph node measuring 18 x 10 x 6 mm. [Bisected and BIT]
6: The sixth specimen is labelled No. 9 lymph node ""and consists of lymph node
with surrounding fat measuring 35 x 16 x 8 mm. [Bisected and BIT]
MICROSCOPIC
1: Sections show a poorly differentiated squarnous cell carcinoma with central
cavitation. The cavitation appears to be due, at least in part, to vascular
invasion by tumour which is present at multiple sites throughout the sections.
Tumour Invades into overlying parietal pleura but appears clear of the soft(7//A16,cs, S7O/3

tissue resection margin. No lymphatic invasion is seen, and peribronchial
lymph nodes show no evidence of metastatic carcinoma. The upper lobe resection
margin is well clear of malignancy. Proximally the tumour has a protruding
endobronchiat component but no in situ squamous carcinoma is found, and the
bronchial resection margin is clear of malignancy. Focal perineural invasion
is found towards the hilum. Lung parenchyma adjacent to the tumour shows
organising pneumonia, while more distant lung parenchyma is unremarkable.
2:Sections show reactive lymphoid hyperplasia and several silicotic nodules,
but there is no evidence of metastatic carcinoma.
3:Sections show small foci of metastatic squamous cell, carcinoma in one of
the lymph nodes.
4-6: Sections show reactive lymphoid hyperplasia and scattered silicotic
nodules, but there is no evidence of metastatic carcinoma.
SUMMARY
Right middle and lower lobectomy, partial resection of right upper lobe and
lymph node sampling:
Poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of apical segment of right lower
lobe, 52 mm in diameter.
Invasion of parietal pleura present, but soft tissue resection margin clear of
malignancy.
Extensive vascular invasion present.
Focal perineural invasion present.
No lymphatic invasion . found.
Metastatic carcinoma in no. 11 lymph node.
Pathological stage T3 N1.

left breast,left,Invasive ductal carcinoma,,Grade III (High grade or poorly differentiated),Malignant,TCGA-56-8628.pdf,    ," Report: 
The patient is a 64-year-old woman with a history of left breast mass. A core needle biopsy was performed. The specimen consists of two fragments of tan-pink tissue. The larger fragment measures 0.9 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm and the smaller fragment measures 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm. Microscopic description: The tumor is composed of cells arranged in cords and nests, with focal comedo necrosis. The tumor cells have high nucleus to cytoplasm ratio, vesicular chromatin, and conspicuous nucleoli. Mitotic figures are easily identified. Immunohistochemical stains show the tumor cells to be positive for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2 neu. The background shows extensive lymphocytic infiltration. No ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or invasive carcinoma is identified in the surrounding breast tissue.

1. ""Site"": left breast. Justification: The report mentions a left breast mass and the biopsy was performed on the left breast.
2. ""Laterality"": left. Justification: The tumor is located in the left breast, as stated in the report.
3. ""Histology"": Invasive ductal carcinoma. Justification: The report mentions the tumor cells are arranged in cords and nests with focal comedo necrosis, consistent with invasive ductal carcinoma.

MACROSCOPIC 
Five specimens received: 
I: The frrst specimen is labelled ""left upper lobe"" and consists of a lobe of lung measurin g 155 x 95 x 
58 mm in the fresh state. Below the hilum there is a finn tumour which measures 68 x 65 mm in 
maximal dimension and has a finn sclerotic cut surface. Towards the superior aspect of this there is a 
finn node which is adherent to the medial aspect of the tumour. Further enlarged nodes are present 
surrounding the inferior aspect of the bronchial resection margin and pulmonary artery. The tumour 
abuts the pleural surface on this medial aspect but appears clear of the lateral aspect by approximately 
10 mm. On sectioning there are areas of necrosis and the tumour has a sclerotic cut face. Elsewhere 
there is apical scarring. Distal to the tumour there is evidence of obstructive pneumonitis and in the 
basal aspect of the lung there is a finn grey nodule. The lymph node superior to me tumour measures 
15 mm in diameter while the lymph node inferior to the tumour measures 23 mm in diameter.

2: The second specimen is labelled ""pulmonary artery margin"" and consists ofa segment of vessel 
measuring 7 x 6 x 4 mm. LBIT] 
3: The third specimen is labelled ""L lower lobe node"" and consists of fragments of blackened lymph 
node measuring 16 x 13 x 4 mm in aggregate. [Largest piece bisected and al1 wrapped and blocked in 
toto.] 
4: The fourth specimen is labelJed ''No.5'' and consists of several pieces of lymph node invested in fat 
and measuring 20 x 15 x 14 mm. [Bisected and blocked in toto, 4A] 
5: The fifth specimen is labelled ""lingula L lung"" and consists of[Wo pieces of blackened lymph node, 
and 17 mm in maximal dimension. [Blocked in toto, SA] 
MICROSCOPIC 
I: Sections show a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Patchy necrosis is present. 
Vascular invasion is presenl but the pulmonary artery is clear of malignancy. No pleural, lymphatic or 
perineura l invasion is identified. The bronchial resection margin is clear of malignancy and shows no 
evidence of squamous metaplasia or dysplasia. Obstructive pneumonitis is confinned adjacent to the 
tumour. A way from the tumour there are at least three further distinct lesions. The first is the nodule 
noted in the lower zone which comprises granulomatous inflammation including numerous giant cells 
of Langhans type with surround ing lymphocytic infiltration and fibrosis. A few tiny foci of necrosis 
are present within this nodule. There are [wo further foci of granulomatous inflammation with 
extensive central necrotic debris surrounded by foamy macrophag es and fibrosis. These appear to be 
centred on bronchi. No organisms are identified in any of these lesions with Grocott or ZN stains. 
However the appearances are highly suspicious for infection, and I note that atypical Mycobacteria 
have been found previously in sputum. The peribronchial lymph nodes are confmned to contain 
metastatic squamous cell carcinoma, and they also have foci of fibrosis and dystrophic calcification, 
but they show no evidence of granulomatous inflamma tion. 
2: Sections of the pulmonary artery show no evidence of malignancy . 
3: Sections of the lymph node show multiple silicotic nodules together with extensive sheets of 
pigmented macrophages but there is no evidence of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma. 
4: Sections show lymph nodes with a follicular hyperplasia, sinus histiocytosis and aggregates of 
pigmented macrophages. There is no evidence of malignancy.  5: Sections show fragments oflymph node and surrounding fat. There is no evidence of metastatic 
squamous cell carcinoma. 
SUMMARY 
Left upper lobectomy and lymph node sampling: 
1: Moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, 68 mm in diameter. 
Vascular invasion present. 
No pleural, lymphatic or perineural infiltration seen. 
Bronchial and pulmonary artery resection margins clear of malignan cy.

FINAL PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS: 
Lung, right upper lobe, biopsies: 
Adenocarcinoma -see comment. 
COMMENTS: 
Histologic sections show an invasive carcinoma consisting 
primarily of sheets of cells with scattered, discrete 
glandular structures. The neoplastic cells have prominent 
nucleoli, and do not have the cytologic appearance of small 
cell carcinoma, grade II neuroendocrine carcinoma (atypical 
carcinoid) or large cell neuroendocrine carCinoma. 
Immunohistochemical stains are performed. The neoplasm 
stains positively for cytokeratin CK7 as well as forTTF-1. 
The neoplasm is negative for CK20, high molecular weight 
keratin SK and p63. The findings support the diagnosis of .-
_gdenocarcinoma of lung primary. There is weak staining for 
synaptophysin. It 1s felt 1n that this is an example of 
non-neuroendocrine carcinoma {adenocarcinoma) that shows 
positive staining for synaptophysin, and that it should not 
result in classification of a neuroendocrine tumor. 
Current NCCN practice guidelines recommend determination of 
EGFR and KRAS mutation status in adenocarcinoma of lung to 
help select patients for Tyrosine-Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) 
therapy. EGFR-activating mutations have been shown to be 
significantly associated with response to TKis and KRAS 
mutations are associated with TKI resistance. They are 
mutually exclusive in NSCLC. Additionally, recent data show 
that ALK (Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase) gene rearrangements in 
adenocarcinoma of lung are associated with resistance to 
TKis and have favorable response rates to Crizotinib, the 
ALK inhibitor agent currently in clinical trials. Mutation 
analysis for KRAS and EGFR-TK domain and ALK gene 
rearrangement by FISH is available as the Lung Cancer 
Mutation Panel. Testing may be performed on 
paraffin-embedded tissue from the primary or metastatic 
tumor or pleural fluid cell block. These tests are 
available on request as a panel or as individual assavs. 
This case has been reviewed by 
who agree with the diagnosis.

GROSS DESCRIPTION 
A. Received fresh in a container labeled ""right upper 
lobe"" is a 296 gm, 17.8 x 11.8 x 4 em, lung lobe compatible 
with right upper lobe. In the hilar region there is an 0.8 em long 
and 1.5 em in diameter bronchial stump which is grossly 
unremarkable. The vessels at the margin are also grossly 
unremarkable. There are some tan-gray lymph nodes up to 1.2 em in 
greatest dimension in the hilar region. The pleural surface is 
pink-purple with some anthracotic pigment deposition. There .is some 
retraction of the pleural surface. The specimen is sectioned, and 
there is a 2.6 x 2 x 1.8 em rubbery tan-white mass underlying the 
area with pleural retraction1 with the mass suggestive of invading 
the pleura. Approximately 2 em from this mass is a separate 4 x 3.5 
x 3.1 ern rubbery tan-white mass. This mass approaches at least near 
to the pleural surface. The larger lesion has yellow-orange 
discoloration surrounding it, suggestive of surrounding pneumonia. 
The remainder of the parenchyma is spongy and red-purple without 
addi tiona! lesions. RS-13, follmving fixation.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION 
The follm'ling template surrunarizes the findings in this 
case: 
Histologic type: Both of the mass lesions consist of poorly 
differentiated non-small cell carcinoma. There are areas that it is 
favored have squamous differentiation, as well as less frequent 
foci suggestive of glandular differentiation (adenocarcinoma). 
Although not entirely identical, the two lesions look similar. 
Histologic grade: Poorly differentiated 
Primary tumor (pT): These two lesions are grossly 2.6 em and 4 em 
in greatest dimension. The 2.6 em in diameter lesion has visceral 
 pleural invasion, with the larger lesion extending very 
peripherally but without definite visceral pleural invasion. 
Although it is difficult to definitely distinguish between 
synchronous primaries and the two masses being part of the same 
process, given the similarities in appearance, based on the new 
guidelines, two nodules of similar histology in the same lobe 
MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION 
would be classified as pT3, Clinical correlation is recommended. 
Margins of resection: The bronchial and vascular resection margins 
are negative. 
Direct extension of tumor: Visceral pleural extension for the 2.6 
em in diameter lesion, no direct extension identified for the larger 
lesion. 
Vascular invasion: Not definitively identified. 
Regional lymph nodes (pN): pNl. There is metastatic carcinoma in 
one of three hilar lymph nodes in part A. The separately submitted 
lymph nodes in parts B, c, D, and E are negative for malignancy. 
Distant metastasis {pM} : pMX 
Other findings: There are inflammatory changes surrounding the 
tumors, with focally prominent pneumonia surrounding the larger 
lesion. 
Note: This case has been reviewed in Intradepartmental consultation 
with all reviewers interpreting the two mass lesions as similar in 
appearance.

KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS
Referring Physician:
Body Site: Lung
Specimen Type :Slides
Clinical Data :Adenocarcinoma
RESULTS :Positive for a p.G12C (c.34G >T) mutation in codon 12
of the KRAS gene.
INTERPRETATION:
Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to correlate with poor
prognosis and resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies in
patients with non-small -cell lung cancer.
COMMENT:
KRAS mutations occur in 15-30% of non-small -cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients and are strongly associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking
history.
This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;
based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are
expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of
the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low
percentage of cells may not be detected.
This test is validated for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and
codon 13 mutations in fresh, frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin
embedded tissue. In particular the test performance has been
established in samples of colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung
carcinoma which harbor these mutations, although several other
tissues are also known to harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of
pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix, etc.).
METHOD/LIMITATIONS:
Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is
selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample ,quantified
and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to
exon 2 of the KRAS gene .PCR products are subjected to single
nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;
primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel
electrophoresis and fluorescence detection .False positive or
negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants
or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

EGFR Mutation Analysis
Referring Physician: .
Body Site: Lung
Clinical Data :Adenocarcinoma
RESULTS: No mutation detected.
INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified in the sample provided
for analysis .Fewer than 5% of non -small cell lung carcinoma
patients without identifiable mutations are reported to be
responsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies. COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more tumor cellularity is optimal
for this mutation analysis .The sample submitted showed 80% tumor
cellularity upon pathologist review.
A frequently occurring sequence change 2361 G>A (Q787Q) was
identified. This polymorphism is known not to have clinical
significance.
Mutations in the tyrosine domain of the epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with differential
responsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)
therapies. The objective response rate among patients with a
sensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%.
This assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain;
based on the current literature, most mutations in non -small-cell
lung carcinoma (NSCLC) are expected to occur in these exons.
Mutations present in less than 10-20% of extracted DNA may not be
detected by this method. Mutation status in a sample may change
during tumor progression or the course of therapy; therefore, this
result cannot be used to infer the presence or absence of a mutation
in another sample or sub -sample obtained from this tumor.
This test is validated for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The
clinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types
is unknown.
METHOD/LIMITATION:
Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is
selected for analysis .DNA is isolated from the samples, quantified
and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to
exons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by
bi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary gel
electrophoresis and fluorescence detection .False positive or
negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants
or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

-pTl N2 Mx "," Site: The specimens are from various locations including the lung, rib, and lymph nodes.

Laterality: The laterality of the specimens is not fully provided, but one lymph node is indicated as pre-carinal, suggesting a mediastinal location on the right side.

Histology: The histological findings include metastatic adenocarcinoma in a lymph node, a primary lung tumor with acinar growth pattern and necrosis, and benign findings in the bone and other lymph nodes.

Stage: Based on the size of the primary lung tumor and the presence of metastasis to a lymph node, the stage is pT1 N2 Mx, indicating that the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes but not to distant organs.

Grade: The grade of the primary lung tumor is moderately differentiated (II).

Behavior: The behavior of the tumor is malignant, as it is a cancer that can invade surrounding tissues and metastasize to other parts of the body.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The specimen consists of a len lung which, in the: inflated state, measures 200 mm in height x 165 x 60 
mm. Fatty and tibrous adhesions are auached to the apex of the: upper lobe where there is a scarred 
area approximately 35 mm in diameter. The pleura is slightly roughened over the mediastinal aspect of 
the upper lobe, approximately 50 mm in ma:-:illluOl dimension, under which a tumour is palpabJe.. Fatly 
tissu-! to a depth of40 mOl is present inferior 10 the bronchial res{""ction margin and this contains 
numerous lymph nodes which are small and black. Numerous large lymph nodes, which measure up to 
35 mOl in maximum dimension. are present superior to the bronchial resection margin. On cut surfaces 
the tumou.r is seen to be 55 mm in maximal dimension. poorly circumscribed, soft and grey and black, 
but with a necrotic centre. It extcnds right up to the pleun.! on the hilar sur£.""\ce of the: lung and also to 
the pleura in the oblique fissure. Tbe tumour appears to be arising from a segmental bronchus. 
probably that of the apicoposterior bronchus of the upper lobe. It is well clear of the bronchial 
re~ction margin. Uninvolved tissue between the tumour and the apex: of the upper lobe is generally 
indurated and that in the ba$lll IIspcct of the lobe is collapsed. Large black lymph nodes arc present 
around major segmcma! bronchi in the lower lobe. No tumour is evident in the lowcr lobe and the 
parenchyma is gencrally normal-appearing lipan from an area approximately 10 mm in maximum 
dimension towards the base which appears fO be an area of haemorrhage. [Lymph nodes inferior to the

Justification: Based on the information provided about tumor size, lymph node involvement, and absence of distant metastasis, this is the correct TNM stage.

Grade: High grade (3)
Justification: The nuclear grade is given as 3, which corresponds to high grade in many systems.

Behavior: Malignant
Justification: This is clear from the context, as the terms carcinoma and malignancy are used throughout the data provided.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ain diagnosis/diagnoses:  
Extensive and locoregionally advanced, central to peripheral, very likely primarily peripheral bronchopulmonary, histologically mixed adenocarcinoma of the right lower lobe of the lung with pleural invasion and metastatic d issemination to both pleural layers and lymph nodes. 
Tumor classification on the basis of this material pT4 pN1 pM1 (P/E) V1 RX, stage IV. C34.3 M 8255/3 G3.  
Comment/supplementary remark:   
Within the main tumor and the lymph node metastases, which are found within the lung in the 
parabronchial region, at the hilus and in sample 5, the large-cell solid tumor component, which has a partly clear -cell character, is predominant. Especially in the area of the main 
tumor margin and the surrounding area the carcinoma shows glandular tubulopapillary and bronchioloalveolar differentiation. No maturation pattern of squamous epithelium is evident on conventional histology (immunohistochemical analysis will follow to provide as definitive confirmation as possible of the bronchopulmonary origin of the tumor and thus exclusion of a late metastatic spread of the reported breast carcinoma). The RX category is explained by the fact that the tumor infiltrating the pleura and disseminated there extends as far as the pleural surface and, with the detection of carcinoma cells in the pleural effusions, the possibility cannot be excluded that some of them remained there. The central bronchus resection line and the resection margins of the large pulmonary vessels and the resection pr eparation of parietal 
pleura itself, as registered under 4., are tumor- free 
  Result of immunohistochemical analysis: a major part of the tumor cells with double expression of low and high molecular weight keratins (M903 and 902). In the glandular differen tiation component, tumor cell nuclei are positive TTF1.  
 The immune profile confirms the diagnosis of an adenocarcinoma of the lung of mixed differentiation.

AILI-J al Investiga11atiire1""Date"," Based on the provided information, here are the answers for the six categories:

Site: The site is the lung, as indicated in the operative information section.

Laterality: The laterality is not explicitly mentioned in the given text, but since there are separate labels for right and left lymph nodes, it can be inferred that the specimens come from both lungs.

Histology: The histology of the mass is not provided in the description, so it cannot be determined with certainty. However, based on the procedures performed (bronchoscopy and thoracoscopy), it could be a lung cancer or another type of lung mass.

Stage: The stage is not provided in the text, as it would require additional information such as the size of the mass and whether it has spread to nearby lymph nodes or other organs.

Grade: The grade is also not provided in the given text. Grade refers to how abnormal the cancer cells look under a microscope and how quickly the cancer is likely to grow and spread.

Behavior: The behavior of the mass cannot be determined without more information, such as whether it is benign or malignant.

Justification for the choices: The site, laterality, stage, grade, and behavior are not explicitly provided in the text, and the histology can only be inferred based on the procedures performed. Therefore, more information is needed to make definitive conclusions about these categories.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GROSS DESCRIPTION 
             A.  Part A is submitted fresh for tissue procurement, 
             labeled ""lingula"".  It consists of an elongated portion of 
    lung tissue, measuring 18 x 4 x 2 cm. maximally.  It has been 
    amputated along an entire edge, which has steel clips and paper tape 
    present.  There is an area of pleural puckering opposite the tape, 
    which has drawn the pleura into a stellate- like area, with a 
    palpable mass deep to that.  The pleura is focally torn along 
    another portion of the specimen.  Black ink is applied over the area 
    of the scar and then the specimen is serially sectioned.  This 
    reveals the presence of a nodular tumor mass immediately beneath the 
    pleura, in the region of the above- mentioned scar.  That tumor mass 
    measures maximally 2 x 1.5 x 1.3 cm.  Sections through the remaining 
    pulmonary parenchyma reveal a consolidated bloody red tissue, 
    without other focal nodules present.  There is some adherent fat 
    present on the pleural surface.  Representative tumor and normal 
    ions are submitted for tissue procurement, per request of 
      Sections after fixation. 
      Part B is submitted fresh, labeled ""Level 10 lymph 
             node"".  It consists of multiple black and red tissue 
    portions.  Three are present, each measuring 6 to 8 mm. in greatest 
    extent.  AS-1

FINAL DIAGNOSIS
A. (Lung, right upper lobe; wedge resection): Squamous cell carcinoma, grade
2, extending to the visceral pleura and measuring 1.9 cm in greatest
dimension.
No convincing lymphatic permeation seen.
Margins of resection free of tumor.
Stage pT2NOMx
Remaining lung without pathologic changes.
B. (Level 7 lymph node; biopsy): Fragments of lymph nodes negative for
metastatic tumor.
C. (Level 4 lymph node; biopsy): Fragments of lymph nodes negative for
metastatic tumor.
D. (Lung, right upper lobe; wedge resection): Segment of benign lung tissue
with subpleural and interstitial fibrosis and chronic inflammation.Aa INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION
A. FROZEN:WEDGE RESECTION RIGHT UPPER LOBE, DISTANT FROM STAPLE LINE: Suture
line is negative for tumor. Grossly, tumor 0.6cm-0.7 cm from stapled margin.
(A91, A92)
GROSS DESCRIPTION
A. The specimen is labeled frozen, wedge resection right upper lobe.
Received fresh is a 22.0 gram, 8.0 x 3.5 x 1.9 cm wedge of lung with a 9.5 cm
staple margin. The pleura is inked blue and the staple margin is submitted
for frozen section with the remnant placed in cassettes A91 and A92. After
the staple margin is removed, the underlying lung parenchyma is inked orange.
There is a 1.9 x 1.7 x 1.5 cm firm white and black nodule causing pleural
puckering and located approximately 0.6 to 0.7 cm from the staple margin.
Sections are submitted as follows: A91 and A92- staplemargin ;A1- tumor
closest to staple margin, A2 and A3 - tumor closest to pleura; A4 remainder
of tumor; A5 - normal lung away from tumor.
B. The specimen is labeled level 7 lymph node. Received in formalin are
multiple fragments of soft tan tissue measuring in aggregate 1.2 x 0.8 x 0.4
cm. The fragments are wrapped and submitted entirely in cassette B1.
C. The specimen is labeled level 4 lymph node. Received in formalin are
multiple small fragments of soft red and black tissue measuring in aggregate
1.3 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm. The specimen is entirely wrapped and submitted in
cassette C1.
D. The specimen is labeled wedge resection, right upper. Received fresh is a
22 gram, 13 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm segment of lung with a 13 cm and 14 cm staple
margin, which are variably located from 1.1 to 2.1 cm apart. The lung
parenchyma is soft, red and unremarkable. No tumor masses are seen. The
pleura is inked blue and the 13 cm margin is submitted in cassettes D1 and D2,
the 14 cm margin is submitted in cassettes D3 and 04 and two representative
sections of the lung are submitted in cassettes D5 and D6.

smoking, The presence of KRAS mutation leads to resistance to EGFR ~ therapies (1). EGFR exon 19 and 21 
mutations are present in about 10% of  and up to 40% in th..-,opulation, common in and 
associated 
with the clinical response to treatment with EGFR inhibitors (2). These mutations are mutually exciusive and 
their presence may have prognostic andlor therapeutic implications (3,4). Clinical studies show high EGFR gene copy 
number by FISH analysis (amplification) to be associated with favorable clinical benefit (clinical response, stable disease, 
time to progression, and survival) In patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase 
inhibitors. 
Approximately 3% of lung adenocarcinomas within the Asian population have an interstitial deletion and inversion in 
chromosome 2p resulting in the EML4IALK fusion gene (ALK+) which is sensitive to AlK inhibitors (5,6). The prevalence 
of this abnormality in the Western population is stili unknown, Detection of this abnormality is critical for identifying 
patients eligible for therapies that target ALK enzymatic activity. EML41ALK rearrangements are mutually exclusive with 
KRAS and EGFR mutations. 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 
SUMMARY STATEMENT 
The posterior segmentectomy demonstrates a 2.5 cm poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma associated with 
angiolymphatic and parietal pleural invasion. Metastatic adenocarcinoma is present in posterior and apical segment 
level 11, level 10 and level 5 lymph nodes. Surgical resection margins are free of tumor. Pathologic stage is T3N2Mx.

MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:  
The specimen is received in three parts, each labeled with the patient's name.  
 1. Part one is received in saline, labeled 'lung, sup erior segment,  
right lower lobe'. It consists of a lobe of the lung measuring 9 x 
 5.5 x 3.5 cm. Two stapled lines are noted measuring 9 cm and 2.5 
cm. The pleura is grey- pink, glistening and mottled lightly with  
fine black streaks. The bronchial margin measures 2 cm and the vascular margin measures 1 cm. Cut surface of the specimen reveals  
a light tan firm nodule measuring 1.5 x 1.4 x 1.2 cm, located 1.5 cm from the overlying pleura and 2 cm from the bronchial resection margin. The remainder of the parenchy ma is pink -red, crepitant  
and blotchy. Representative sections are submitted.  
 2. Part two is received in formalin, labeled '5th rib right'. It consists of a segment of rib measuring 10.5 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm. Scant blood and fibroconnective tissue is attached on the outer surface of bone. The cut surface appears trabeculated and unremarkable.  
Representative sections are submitted in one cassette following  
decalcification.  
 3. Part three is received in saline, labeled 'station 12 lymph node'. It consists of five irregular fragments of tan -brown soft 
tissue ranging from 0.4 to 1.0 cm in greatest dimension and measuring 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm in aggregate. Entirely submitted in one cassette.

ain diagnosis/diagnoses:  
Peripheral bronchopulmonary, histologically mixed adenocarcinoma of the middle with pleural invasion and a second small focus or satellite nodule of a tubular adenocarcinoma  with a small bronchiooalveolar growth component and likewise pleural infiltration (sample 2.)). TNM classification on the basis of this material pT2 pN0 pM1 (PUL) V1 RX, stage IV. C34.2 M8255/3.  
Comment/supplementary remark:   
The tumor classification as adenocarcinoma of the lung showing a predominantl y 
tubulopapillary structural pattern still requires confirmation by appropriate 
immunohistochemical analysis. The classification of the second small tumor focus as a (hematogenous) metastasis that – despite a certain difference in histoarchitecture and cel l 
morphology in places – is based on the structure of the focus, which is lacking the fibrous remodeling or cicatricial zone here that is characteristic of a primary peripheral bronchopulmonary carcinoma. Vascular invasion can be seen in the intratumoral, thick -walled 
pulmonary vessels of the larger tumor, where there is tumor spread with endobronchial occlusion in a subsegmental branch of the bronchus. The R1 classification is explained by the observation that the tumor glands invading the pleura extend as far as the outer surface of the pleura in places and the tumor cells thus remain in the pleural space.    Result of immunohistochemical analysis (both tumor foci)  
CK7 positive throughout, CK20 negative. TTF1.positive (in the smaller focus more than in the larger one), only isolated tumor cells with delicate cell membrane staining for surfactant protein B.  This not only confirms that it is an adenocarcinoma of the lung and, but also supports the view that the smaller focus represents the metastasis of the larger focus  
seen in 1.) and classified as primary tumor.

extending close to the visceral pleura with endobronchial growth in and obstruction of a subsegmental branch of 
B4; distance of endobronchial tumor growth from the bronchus resection plane about 0.9 em. Tumor extending 
close to the staple suture line first described and separated from this by whitish hardened tissue. Other airways 
and rest of parenchyma inconspicuous, only vessels prominent and relatively dilated. Also in S5 a peripheral, 
subpleural compact area, max. 2 em in size, section surfaces pale brownish, max. thickness 0.2 em. 
2.) Interlobar LN (station 11) right: 1 em lesioned node or node part. 
3.) Hilar LN (station 10) right: two lesioned nodes or node parts with some surrounding tissue, 0.6 and 0.2 em. 
4.) Subcarinal LN (station 7): 1.5 em lesioned node or node part some surrounding tissue. 
Examined: 
1.) 1 section of tumor with immediately adjacent visceral pleura, I section of tumor with whitish area to first­
named staple suture line (staple suture line marked green), I section of tumor with endobronchial tumor growth,

Page 4 of 4 "," Based on the surgical pathology report, here is the assessment:

Site: Lung (This is mentioned in the clinical diagnosis)

Laterality: Not provided (The report does not mention whether it is right or left lung cancer)

Histology: Not completely specified, but there is a mention of a ""poorly circumscribed stellate firm gray-white tumor"" which could suggest a carcinoma. However, a definitive histological diagnosis requires further investigation.

Stage: Also not provided in the report. Staging would require additional information such as the size of the primary tumor, involvement of lymph nodes, and presence of metastasis.

Grade: Not provided. This would typically require microscopic examination of tissue samples to assess the degree of differentiation of the cancer cells.

Behavior: Malignant (This is implied by the clinical diagnosis of lung cancer).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tumor Location: left upper lobe 
Tumor Size: 3.6 x 3.4 x 2.9 cm 
Vascular Invasion: extensively present. 
Lymphatic Invasion: extensively present. 
Bronchial Margin: negative 
Vascular Margin: The tumor is present within the perivascular fibroadipose tissue at the pulmonary arterial 
margin. 
Parenchymal Margins: not applicable. 
Pleura/Soft Tissue Margin: The tumor invades through the visceral pleura and is present at the pleural 
adhesion margins. 
Pathologic Stage (AJCC, 7th edition): p stage lilA (T4 N1 MX). 
Additional comments: The tumor is predominantly squamous cell carcinoma with areas of glandular formation 
and signet ring cells. Mucin stains (A6, A8, A 11, A 12) highlight the presence of intra and extracellular mucin. 
Immunohistochemical stains for TTF-1 and p-63 (blocks A8, A11, A4, A10) were used in the evaluation of this 
case. The adenocarcinoma component merge and mingle with the squamous cell carcinoma and represents 
approximately 5-10% of the tumor, consistent with adenosquamous type. EGFR mutation testing will be 
performed and the results reported as an addendum.

Comments
Two peribronchial lymph nodes were identified within specimen #4,
demonstrates a small focus of adenocarcinoma. Therefore, this is
staged as a pN1.
The level 10 lymph nodes left lung, level 7 lymph nodes left lung,
and level 5 lymph nodes left lung were all received fragmented and
therefore an accurate node count cannot be performed.
An elastic stain was performed which demonstrates the adenocarcinoma
to extend up to but not into or through the visceral pleura (with
appropriate positive control).
At the request of the undersigned pathologist, these slides have
been additionally reviewed by Dr. ^ who concurs with the
diagnosis.

ENO OF REPORT 
"," Site: Right upper lobe
 Laterality: Right
 Histology: Squamous cell (epidermoid) carcinoma, keratinizing type
 Stage: pT2aN0MX
 Grade: Moderately differentiated (G2)
 Behavior: Malignant, as indicated by the presence of a primary tumor with invasion into surrounding tissues.

The justification for these choices is based on the provided surgical pathology report, which details the gross and microscopic examination of the specimens received. The report describes a tumor in the right upper lobe, which was identified as squamous cell carcinoma, keratinizing type, and moderately differentiated (G2). The stage was determined to be pT2aN0MX based on the size of the tumor (>3 em but <= 5 em), the absence of regional lymph node metastasis, and the inability to assess distant metastasis. The behavior of the tumor is malignant, as it shows evidence of invasion into surrounding tissues.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Left upper lobe mass. No preoperative tissue diagnosis . 
MACROSCOPIC 
One specimen submitted. 
The specimen is labelled 'left upper lobe wedge resection' and consists of a wedge oflung tissue, 130 x 
70 x 30 mm. The specimen bears a line of staples 110 mm in length. Protruding from one aspect of 
the pleural surface is a palpable mass. The pleura is free and mobile over the mass. 35 mm away from 
this lesion is a firm pleural plaque, 30 mm in diameter. Elsewhere the pleura shows some irregular 
grey and white discolouration. Serial slicing reveals a well defined yellowish white tumour mass, 25 
mm in greatest diameter, approximately 2 mm deep to the pleura. The cut surface shows small areas of 
yellowish necrosis. The tumour is at least 25 mm clear of the stapled surgical margin. No other lesions 
are identified. The uninvolved lung shows severe emphysema. The mass lesion has been sampled for 
Microbiology and for  [IA-IB tumour with overlying pleura; lC-ID pleural _iir decalcification; IE-IF uninvolved lung parenchyma.] 
MICROSCOPY 
Sections reveal a peripherally located moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma demonstrating 
predominantly acinar and focal solid architecture. The tumour is positive for CK7 and TTFI and 
negative for CK20. Zones of geographic necrosis are evident within the confines of the tumour. The 
tumour does not involve the pleura and is macroscopically clear of the intraparenchyma l stapled 
margin. No lymphatic or vascular invasion is identified and no perineural permeation by tumour is 
seen. Immediately adjacent alveolated lung parenchyma shows organising pneumonia and acute 
bronchopneumonia. Remaining lung shows emphysema. Focal areas of pleural and subpleural 
fibroelastotic scarring with calcification are noted. No granulomas are seen. 
SUMMARY 
Left upper lobe wedge resection: 
Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. 
Tumour size 25mm. 
Pleura not involved. 
Clear of margin. 
No lymphatic , vascular or perineural invasion. 
Pathological stage: n. 
Immediately adjacent alveolated lung parenchyma shows organising pneumonia and acute

3. ""Histology"": Squamous cell carcinoma. As stated in the report, the tumor is a squamous cell carcinoma.
4. ""Stage"": pT3N0Mx. The tumor has invaded the primary bronchus (T3), but there's no evidence of lymph node involvement (N0) or distant metastasis (Mx).
5. ""Grade"": Moderately to poorly differentiated. This is based on the report stating ""moderately differentiated"" and also mentioning ""poorly differentiated"" in the paraphrenic extension biopsy.
6. ""Behavior"": Malignant. This is implied as it's a cancerous tumor, which by definition is malignant.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CLINICAL HISTORY AND PRE - OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
M smoker (100 pack -years )with hx of prostate cancer ( ) and
COPD, now with a 1.5 cm RML mixed solid and ground -glass nodule and
multiple additional bilateral lung nodules.
MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received fresh, in six parts, each labeled with the
patient's name.
1. Part one is labeled 'right middle lobe nodule'. It consists of a
wedge shaped portion of lung measuring 11 x 5 x 2 cm. There is a
staple line identified on the specimen, measuring 10 cm in length.
There is a cut identified on the specimen measuring 1.5 cm in
length. On further sectioning there is a gray white ill defined area
measuring 1.1 x 1 cm is identified. This area is 0.3 cm from the
staple line and 0.4 cm from the pleural surface. The staple line is
inked blue. Further sectioning of the lung reveals spongy tan maroon
parenchyma. One portion from the ill defined area is submitted for
frozen section analysis. Representative sections are submitted.
2. Part two is labeled 'station #9 lymph node'. It consists of a
single lymph node measuring 2.4 x 1.5 x 1 cm. The cut surface is
grey-black. Entirely submitted in one cassette.
3. Part three is labeled 'station #10 lymph node'. It consists of
multiple irregular fragments of grey-black lymph nodes measuring 1.5
x 0.8 x 0.5 cm in aggregate. Entirely submitted in one cassette.
4. Part four is labeled 'completion of right middle lobectomy'. It
consists of a lobe of lung measuring 10.5 x 5.5 x 2 cm and weighing
38 grams. Two staple lines, measuring 8 cm and 6 cm in length are
noted. The bronchial and vascular margins are identified. The
serosal surface is grey-purple and shows a subpleural grey-black
nodule measuring 0.9 x 0.8 cm. Sectioning reveals an unremarkable red beefy lung parenchyma. The subpleural nodule likely represents
the lymph node. No discrete mass lesions are noted. Representative
sections are submitted.
5. Part five is labeled 'station #4 lymph node'. It consists of
three irregular segments of grey-black lymph nodes ranging from 0.2
to 0.5 cm in greatest dimension .Entirely submitted in one
cassette.
6. Part six is labeled 'station #7 lymph node'. It consists of a
single grey-black lymph node measuring 0.8 x 0 .5 x 0.3 cm. Entirely
submitted in one cassette.

MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY
KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS
Referring Physician
Body Site :Right middle lobe of lung
Specimen Type: Slides
Clinical Data :Adenocarcinoma
RESULTS: Wild-type gene.
INTERPRETATION:
No mutations were identified at codons 12 and 13 of the KRAS gene.
COMMENT:
Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to be associated with poor prognosis ,and resistance to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor
therapies in patients with non -small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). KRAS
mutations occur in 15-30% of NSCLC patients and are strongly
associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking history.
This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;
based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are
expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of
the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low
percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated
for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and codon 13 mutations in
fresh, frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue. In
particular the test performance has been established in samples of
colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung carcinoma which harbor
these mutations, although several other tissues are also known to
harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of pancreas, bile duct, ovary,
appendix, etc.).
Analysis of EGFR mutation or gene amplification status may provide
additional information regarding this patient's probability of
response to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies, if
clinically indicated. See references.
METHOD/LIMITATION:
Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is
selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified
and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to
exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single
nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;
primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel
electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or
negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants
or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

EGFR Mutation Analysis
Referring Physician:
Body Site :Right middle lobe of lung
Clinical Data :Adenocarcinoma
RESULTS: No mutation detected.
INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified in the sample provided
for analysis .Fewer than 5% of non-small cell lung carcinoma
patients without identifiable mutations are reported to be
responsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies. COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more tumor cellularity is optimal
for this mutation analysis. The sample submitted showed 70% tumor
cellularity upon pathologist review.
A frequently occurring sequence change 2361>GA (Q787Q) was
identified .This polymorphism is known not to have clinical
significance.
Mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with
differential responsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase
inhibitor (TKI) therapies. The objective response rate among
patients with a sensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%.
This assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain;
based on the current literature ,most mutations in non -small-cell
lung carcinoma (NSCLC) are expected to occur in these exons.
Mutations present in less than 10-20 %of extracted DNA may not be
detected by this method .Mutation status in a sample may change
during tumor progression or the course of therapy; therefore, this
result cannot be used to infer the presence or absence of a mutation
in another sample or sub-sample obtained from this tumor.
This test is validated for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The
clinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types
is unknown.
METHOD:
Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is
selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified
and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to
exons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by
bi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary gel
electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or
negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants
or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

INTEGRATED ONCOLOGY
Fluorescence In-Situ Hybridization (FISH)
Referring Physician
Body Site: Right middle lobe of lung
Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma
INTERPRETATION:
Negative for a rearrangement involving the ALK gene.
Probe #Nuclei Examined % Positive Nuclei %
Control values
2p23(ALK) 50 0.0 <15 A total of 50 cells were scored.
FINDINGS:
FISH was performed on paraffin embedded tissue sections using the
Vysis ALK Break Apart Probe for the ALK gene at 2p23 (
FDA approved). When a rearrangement involving ALK is
present, either inversion or translocation, one of the two fusion
signals separates as one red and one green signal. In this
specimen, separated signals were present in 0% of the nuclei scored.
This result is within the normal limits.
COMMENTS: Three to four copies of ALK were observed in 26.0% of
cells. This gain of intact ALK fusion hybridization signals
represents an aneuploid population with extra copies of chromosome
2/2p ALK region .Additional copies of ALK are not uncommon in
NSCLCs, although the significance of extra copies of the ALK gene in
lung carcinoma is unclear at this time (Salido M. et al. J Thorac
Oncol. 2011;6:21-27).

of S6 and S9, max. 8.5 em in size, with a predominantly clear and somewhat arcuate demarcation, extending 
right up to the pleura at the junction S6/8. Opening or truncation of intermediate branches of B8 in the tumor. 
Narrowing of some subsegmental branches ofB6 and B9. Pleura shows diffuse dark discoloration and extensive 
ragged grayish-yellow coating. 
2.) Parietal pleura: flat preparation 8.5 x 3.2 em and up to 0.7 em thick with turbid and patchy brownish 
discoloration, in some areas with ragged grayish-yellow coating of surface. 
3.) Lobar LN (station 12) upper lobe right: 1.8 em lesioned node or node part. 
4.) Lobar LN (station 12) middle lobe right: 2 em lesioned node or node part.

 EVALUATION 
Primary diagnosis/diagnoses: 
Large, intermediate to peripheral bronchopulmonary, histologically poorly differentiated, large-cell and 
polymorphocellular nonkeratinizing squamous cell carcinoma of the right lower lobe of the lung mainly located 
in 88. 
TNM classification according to this picture pT2 pNO pMX RO, stage IB. 034.3 M8070/3. 
Secondary diagnosis/diagnoses: 
Focally marked active chronic inflammation predominantly in the tumor and focal chronic organizing retention 
pneumonia at the tumor margin (sample !.)). Fibrinous chronic granulating and fibrosing visceral (sample 1.)) 
and parietal pleuritis (sample 2.)). Uncharacteristic chronic, predominantly interstitial inflammation and fibrosis 
associated with focal fibrous and small honeycomb-like parenchyma remodeling along the ventrobasalmargin 
of 88. Subpleural accentuated intraalveolar macrophage accumulation in 810 (sample !.)). Lymph nodes with 
uncharacteristic reactive lesions and anthracotic pigment deposits (samples 1.) and 3.)-9.)). 
Remark/addendum: 
An unequivocal infiltration of the visceral pleura cannot be found. The resection margin of the bronchus and 
vessels and all lymph nodes ideutified and excised are tumor-free. 
No asbestos bodies are found in the prepared section planes. But very much further-reaching investigations, 
especially dust analyses, are needed to determine the asbestos exposure of the lung. "," 1. ""Site"": Right lower lobe. Justified as the report clearly mentions the tumor's location in the right lower lobe.

Macroscopy: 
Specimen consists ofa left pneumonectomy specimen measuring 300 x 290 x 58 mm in the 
inflated state. There is an area of adhesion between the upper and lower lobes across the 
oblique fissure. The pleura otherwise appears normal. Located in the upper lobe 25 mm from 
the resection margin is a large well circumscribed firm grey mass measuring 62 nun in 
maximal dimension. It appears to extend across the oblique fissure into the lower lobe. It 
comes close to the external pleural margin but it appears to be clear of it. The tumour shows 
central necrosis and cavitation . Near its most medial aspect of the specimen, several lymph 
nodes show some pale discolouration suggestive of direct invasion by tumour. Adjacent lung 
tissue shows evidence of mild centri-acinar emphysema. The lung tissue distal to the turnouT 
in the lower lobe shows yellow discolouration suggcstive of lipoid pneumonia. [Bronchial

Gross Description: 
Received in a single container labeled wedge 
resection left upper lobe. The specimen consists of a wedge 
resection of the lung measuring 9 x 6 x 1.5 em. The pleural surface 
is yellow to red tan and slightly anthracotic. On sectioning reveals 
a circumscribed white tan firm nodule measuring 2 em in greatest 
dimension that is 0.1 em from.the pleural surface and extends 1 em 
from the resection margin. A representative section was examined at 
the time of surgery. Received with the specimen are cassettes

follows: A frozen section, B shaved resection margin, C through F 
additional sections from nodule. 
Microscopic Description: 
The slides labeled are examined. See diagnosis. 
Final Diagnosis 
Lung, left upper lobe (wedge biopsy): 
Adenocarcinoma: 
moderately differentiated 
measuring 2.0 em in greatest diameter 
· extending up to but not through pleura 
tumor identified within endothelial lined lyrnphovascular space 
areas of fibrosis 
lymph nodes: No lymph nodes resected {see comment) PAS 9 
SPC-A 
CPT: 88307, 88331 
Comments 
The frozen section diagnosis is confirmed. 
In some areas dense fibrosis is present associated with the tumor. 
Although the adenocarcinoma grows along alveolar spaces, the areas of 
fibrosis remove this from the differential diagnosis of a 
bronchoalveolar carcinoma. The tumor focally extends up to the 
pleural surface but does not extend into the pleural surface.

Gross Description 
The specimen is received in multiple parts \'Ii th the first 
received fresh. This consists of a wedge of lung which measures 
approximately 3 em in maximum dimension. Basal margins are 
present. The specimen is sectioned to show a 6 cm calcified 
yellow-white nodule. The specimen is submitted totally after 
decalcification. 
The specimen received as level 2, is received in formalin and is 
designated specimen ""B"". This consists of a single piece of 
gray-black tissue measuring 3 rom in greatest dimension, totally 
submitted. 
The specimen received as left upper lobe is designated specimen 
""C"", and is received fresh. This consists of a lobe of lung which 
weighs 138 gm and measures 14 x 9 x 4.5 cm. The surface shows 
marked puckering of the pleura and this area is inked prior to 
sectioning. The bronchial margins are removed for frozen 
section. Sectioning the lung shows a firm lobulated gray-white 
tumor which is subpleural in location, although grossly does not 
appear to extend through the pleura. The tumor measures 4.1 x 
2.3 x 3 cm. It is located beneath the pleura and approximately 1 
cm from the bronchial resection margin. The lung parenchyma is 
not involved by tumor, it is pink and soft. Sectioning the 
peribronchial tissue shows a large lymph node measuring 1.3 em in 
greatest dimension. This is inked with blue dye and sectioned 
into three parts. A possible additional node is identified. It Page 20f3 
 is placed in cassette 7. Sections have been submitted as

more solid nests of cells within fibrotic stroma. 
B. One slide is examined. These are sections of lymph node characterized by 
moderate sinus histiocytosis and anthracosis. There is no evidence of 
involvement by tumor. 
C. Eight slides are examined. Sections of lung include residual tumor 
(slides 5 and 6 ). composed of abnormal glands. There is surrounding 
pneumonitis with aggregated foamy histiocytes present within alveoli. 
associated with interstitial infiltration by inflammatory cells. including 
lymphocytes. plasma cells and eosinophils. Sections of the second-described 
mass (block C3) reveal a circumscribed. but non-encapsulated. nodular mass. 
composed of a monotonous population of cells having ovoid to spindle-shaped 
nuclei. arranged in a nested/organoid pattern. The cells have bland chromatin 
I'lith inconspicuous nucleoli. Mitotic figures are not readily identified. The 
grossly-described bullous area is characterized by irregular disruption of the 
subpleural alveolar architecture. associated with irregular fibrous thickening 
of the pleura. I'lhich is infiltrated by chronic inflammatory cells. including 
lymphocytes and plasma cells. forming occasional loose aggregates. Clusters 
of pigmented histiocytes are present within the dilated alveolar spaces. 
Random sections of lung reveal mild patchy dilation of alveoli. most notably 
within the peripheral portions of the parenchyma. No other tumor is 
identified. Sections of the bronchial margin are lined by ciliated. 
pseudostratified columnar epithelium with areas of squamous metaplasia. The 
vascular margin of resection is uninvolved by tumor. A peribronchial lymph 
node is characterized by sinus histiocytosis and anthracosis. There is no 
morphologic evidence of involvement by tumor. 
D. One slide is examined. including the entirely submitted specimen. These 
are sections of a biopsy portion of lung. composed of benign alveolar 
parenchyma. There is adherent fibrofatty tissue. consistent with parietal 
pleura. There is no evidence of involvement by tumor. No lymph node is 
identified. 
E. One slide is examined. These are sections of clotted blood and organizing 
fibrin. A few clusters of mildly reactive mesothelial cells are focally 
present within the clot. occasionally forming gland-like structures. No lymph

Gross Description
The specimens are received in ten containers, each labeled with the patient's name and medical record number.
The first specimen is further designated as ""level IX lymph node"". It consist of two fragments of yellow/tan fibroadipose tissue
measuring 1.1 x 0.8 x 0.2 and 1.0 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm. Blue surgical dye is noted in one of the tissue fragments. This tissue
fragment is submitted in its entirety in cassette Al, and the remaining tissue fragment is submitted in cassettes A2.
The second specimen is additionally designated as ""level Vill lymph node"", it consist of a fragment
yfibroadipose tissue measuring 1.2 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm. A second smaller apparent lymph node is included which mle
measures 0.6cm in greatest dimension. One dissection of the larger tissue fragment reveals a single possible anthracotic l y m p h node
measuring 0.6 cm. The entire specimen is submitted in cassette B1. yp
The third specimen is further designated as ""level V lymph nodes"". It consist of a single possible lymph node
measuring 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm. The specimen is submitted whole in cassette C1.

examination. The specimen has been previously opened to reveal a heterogenous white/tan mass measuring 7.0 x 5.5 x
5.3 cm.. The lesion appears to multi focally abut the surface; however, no gross invasion is identified. The mass shows
multi focal areas of apparent hemorrhage and necrosis. The white/tan mass- grossly appears to approach within 0.3 cm of
the nearest stapled surgical resection margin. The staple line is inked blue and removed. Radial section demonstrating
the relationship of the mass to the inked resection margin is submitted in cassette J4. Sectioning through the mass
reveals multiple small cavities containing a yellow/brown purulent appearing fluid. A single darkly pigmented apparent
lymph node is identified in.the hilar region which measured approximately 2.1 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm.

PART #1: LEFT UPPER LOBE
Resident Pathologist:
Thpecimen is received fresh labeled with the patient's name
and designated as left upper lobe. It consists of a grossly
i entifiable lobectomy specimen, measuring 18.0 x 8.2 x 3.3 cm and
weighing in aggregate 163 gm. In the epical half, on the lateral
aspect of the lobe, is a tumor mass, measuring 4.5 cm in greatest
dimension. The mass has an irregular infiltrating border and involves
the pleural surface, such that the pleura is puckered in the area
overlying the tumor. This area of puckering measures 2.5 cm in
greatest dimension. The tumor is approximately 0.5 cm from the hilar
bronchial margin and appears grossly to involve large branches of the
right upper lobe bronchus and blood vessels. On cut section, the
tumor is tan-white and gray, marbleized in appearance. There are two
staple lines on the specimen. The epical staple line measures 4.5 cm
in length and the more inferior staple line measures 6.0 cm in length.
The tumor approaches to within 0.5 cm of the epical staple line. The
staple lines are removed and the lung parenchyma adjacent is inked
blue. The pleural surface overlying the tumor has been inked black.
The specimen is serially sectioned, revealing no other lesions.
Representative sections are submitted.

TISSUE DESCRIPTION:
Right middle lobe lung (4.8 x 1.2 x 1 cm) and right lower lobe lung with portion
of middle
lobe and posterior segment of right upper lobe (250 grams) and superior
mediastinal (right
lower paratracheal), inferior mediastinal (subcarinal, right lower paratracheal)
and N1
(interlobar) lymph nodes
Al, A2, A3, A4, 81, 82, 83, 84, B5, B6,B7, B8,89, 810
DIAGNOSIS:
Lung, right lower lobe with portion of middle lobe and posterior segmentof right
upper lobe,
lobectomy: Invasive grade 4 (of 4) adenocarcinoma, with sarcomatoid
differentiation, forming a
3.5 x 3.5 x 3 cm mass centered on the interlobar fissure and involving both upper
and lower
lobes.The bronchial margin and multiple (3) intrapulmonary peribronchial lymph
nodes are
negative for tumor.
Lung, right middle lobe, wedge excision: Atypical lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate,
suspicious for
low grade B-cell lymphoma. Definitive diagnosis and classification will be
reported in an
addendum.
Lymph nodes, N1, excision: Multiple N1 (3 of 3 interlobar) lymph nodes involved by
metastatic
adenocarcinoma.
Lymph nodes, superior, inferior mediastinal, excision: Multiple superior
mediastinal (2 right
lower paratracheal), inferior mediastinal (2 subcarinal, 2 paraesophageal) lymph
nodes are
negative for tumor.
ADDENDUM:
Immunoperoxidase studies were performed on paraffin sections of the right middle
lobe biopsy
using antibodies directed against the following antibodies: CD20, C03, kappa and
lambda
immunoglobulin light chains. There is a mixed population of Co20-positive B-
lymphocytes and
CD3-positive T-lymphocytes distributed in a pattern typical of reactive
hyperplasia. A
polytypic pattern of immunoreactivity for immunoglobulin light chains is seen in
mature plasma
cells.The findings support a diagnosis of reartivp lvmohoid hyperplasia.

GROSS DESCRIPTION 
             A.  Part A  is submitted fresh for frozen labeled ""R4 lymph 
             node"" consists of multiple fragments of tan- white and 
    yellow tissue admixed with anthracotic pigment.  The aggregate 
    measurement is 4 x 2 x 0.5 cm.  Submitted entirely for frozen 
    section. 
             B.  Part B is submitted fresh for frozen labeled ""L4 lymph 
             node"" consists of multiple fragments of gray- red and yellow 
    tissue with an aggregate dime f 2 x 2 x 0.5 cm.  Submitted 
    entirely for frozen section.  
             C.  Received fresh,  ""level 10 lymph node"", are two 
             slightly rubbery gray- black-red tissues, in keeping with 
    lymph nodes, measuring 0.35 cm. in greatest dimension and 0.7 x 0.5 
    x 0.5 cm.  The larger tissue is bisected and the specimens are 
    entirely submitted in two blocks, as labeled.  AS-2 
 
    BLOCK SUMMARY:  1 - Smaller node in toto; 2 - bisected larger node. 
 
             D.  Received fresh, labeled ""level 5 lymph node"", are two 
             slightly rubbery gray- black-red tissues, in keeping with 
    lymph nodes, averaging 1.1 x 0.6 x 0.6 cm.  The specimens are 
    bisected and entirely submitted independently in two blocks (one 
    bisected node per cassette).  AS-2 
             E.  Received fresh, labeled ""subcarinal lymph node"", are 
             four slightly rubbery tan- gray-red tissues, in keeping with 
    lymph nodes, measuring up to 0.6 cm. in greatest dimension.  The 
    specimens are submitted in toto in one block.  AS-1 
             F.  Received fresh, labeled ""level 6 lymph node"", are two 
             soft tan- red to gray- black tissues, in keeping with lymph 
    nodes, measuring 0.5 and 2.4 cm. in greatest dimension, with a scant 
    amount of associated adipose tissue.  The larger node is bisected 
    and the specimens are entirely submitted in two blocks, as labeled. 
    AS-2 
 
    RY:  1 - Smaller node in toto; 2 - bisected larger node. 
    
  
  
             G.  Left lung submitted fresh for tissue procurement 
             labelled ""left lung"" is an intact lung with two lobes 
    weighing 442 grams.  There is a suture line present at the 
    amputation point of the main left bronchus, the left main pulmonary 
    artery and main left pulmonary vein.  The pleural surface of the 
    lung is intact with a finely stippled anthracotic pigment present. 
    No obvious areas of puckering of the pleura or umbilication are 
    evident.  Several small possible peribronchial lymph nodes are 
    present adjacent to the bronchial stump.  There is a mass that is 
    palpable in the interlobar fissure.  This appears to be below the 
    surface of the lung.  Sections are placed through the mass and this 
    reveals a large tumor mass which is immediately inferior to the main 
    bronchus.  The tumor mass measures maximally 6 x 5 x 4 cm.  It 
    arises approximately 1 cm below the bronchial cuff margin that 
    grossly does not appear to be involved by tumor.  There does appear 
    to be at least one lymph node which is partially involved by tumor 
    adjacent the bronchus.  Portions of the t ormal lung are 
    submitted for procurement per request of   Further 
    sectioning of the lung reveals a second t present deep to 
    the pleural surface of the lower lobe.  This pleural mass as central 
    necrosis and measures maximally 3 x 2 x 1.5 cm.  It has the same 
    fleshy  tan- white gritty cut surface as does the main tumor mass. 
    The upper lobe does not appear to have any discrete nodules.  It is 
    crepitant gray- tan tissue without focal nodularity.  Sections after 
    fixation. 
    BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 - bronchial margin; 2 - vascular margin; 3 - 
    pleural margin of the main dominant tumor mass; 4- 7 - dominant tumor 
    mass; 8-10 - secondary smaller tumor including pleural surface; 11 - 
    random left upper lobe; 12 - random left lower lobe; 13- 14 - 
    bronchial lymph nodes. 
 
     
 
MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION 
             Microscopic sections of both lesions present in the left 
             lung have a similar histologic appearance.  Both are 
    moderate to poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas with cells 
    exhibiting prominent eosinophilic cytoplasm.  It is not clear from 
    the histology if this represents two separate primary tumors or an 
    intrapulmonary metastasis from the main lung tumor.  Results of the 
    evaluation of the lung are summarized in the following template: 
 
    Histologic type:  Adenocarcinoma. 
    Histologic grade:  Moderate to poorly differentiated. 
    Primary tumor (pT):  Two lesions are present.  The larger lesion 
    measures 6 x 5 x 4 cm., the smaller lesion 3 x 2 x 1.5 cm. (pT2). 
    Margins of resection:  Bronchial and vascular margins of resection 
    are free of tumor.  Visceral pleural surface free of tumor. 
    Direct extension of tumor:  Absent. 
    Venous (large vessel) invasion:  Negative. 
    Arterial (large vessel) invasion:  Negative. 
    Lymphatic (small vessel) invasion:  Negative. 
    Regional lymph nodes (pN):  Two of six bronchial lymph nodes contain 
    metastatic adenocarcinoma (2/6).  All mediastinal lymph nodes are 
       negative (pN1). 
    Distant metastasis (pM):  Cannot be assessed (pMX).

    A.  Lymph node, R4, resection: 
          Negative for malignancy. 
 
    B.  Lymph node, L4, resection: 
          Negative for malignancy. 
 
    C.  Lymph node, level 10, resection: 
          Negative for malignancy.

    F.  Lymph node, level 6, resection: 
          Negative for malignancy. 
 
    G.  Lung, left pneumonectomy: 
          Multicentric, moderate to poorly differentiated 
          adenocarcinoma.  Bronchial, vascular and visceral pleural 
          surfaces are free of involvement by tumor. 
          Two of six peribronchial lymph nodes contain metastatic 
          adenocarcinoma (2/6).

fresh for frozen section diagnosis.The surgeon changed his mind. The pleura is pink/tan
and spongy to red with anthracotic marbling. The lung is sectioned to have a 1.5 x 1.5 x
1.0 cm tumor mass. The mass appears circumscribed and possibly within a vessel. The mass
is 2.0 cm from the bronchial margin and does not involve the pleura. The tumor appears to
have an adjacent smaller nodule, which ranges up to 0.5 cm. The lung is sectioned fresh to
have a peripheral pink/tan spongy appearance on the anterior surface in the superior
aspect.The tumor has a central location adjacent to the hilar structures. There is focal
scant mucin filled bronchioles in the area of the tumor. The parenchyma demonstrates mild
congestion inferiorly. No additional masses or lesions are identified. Sections are
sampled as labeled in the following cassettes:

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:
A.Sections of the mass 'grossly described demonstrate an invasive
malignant epithelial neoplasm .The tumor is composed of infiltrating
nests of somewhat polygonal cells with distinct cell borders with
cells containing a small to moderate amount of cytoplasm and enlarged
nuclei with nuclear pleomorphism .There are nests with central
necrosis .There are also rare neoplastic cells with dense
eosinophilic cytoplasm .There is no definite lymphovascular
invasion .The tumor is seen closely approaching ,but not involving,
the pleural surface. Focal vague lumina differentiation is noted.
Immunohistochemistry stains are obtained and the neoplastic cells are
positive with cytokeratin 5, positive with cytokeratin 7, negative
with cytokeratin 20, negative staining with TTF-1, strong nuclear
staining with p63, and negative staining of the tumor cells with
Napsin-A. The remainder of the lung demonstrates mild interstitial
fibrosis with mildly thickened alveolar septae.
B.Multiple sections are examined and sections of the bronchial surgical
margins are free of tumor. The vascular margins are also free of
tumor. No peribronchial lymph node is identified .Sections of the
lung at the previous wedge resection site demonstrates hemorrhage
with no residual tumor. Random sections of the lung demonstrate mild
fibrosis and bronchiectasis.
C.Sections demonstrate fragments of a benign lymph node with mild
anthracotic pigment .There is no malignancy.
D.Sections are of fragments of a benign lymph node with similar
findings as described above .There is no malignancy.
E.Sections are of fragments of a benign lymph node with similar
findings as described above.There is no malignancy. 4060

Sections show a moderately differentiated, focally keratinizing squamous 
cell carcinoma demonstrating extensive tumor necrosis. Pleural and 
vascular invasion are not identified. Lymphatic invasion is present 
focally (confirmed by D2-40 immunohistochemical staining for lymphatic 
endothelium),.but lymph node metastases are not identified. The patient• · s history of previous oropharyngeal squamous carcinoma is noted, but 
slides are not available for comparison. Assuming the present tumor to 
be a primary pulmonary tumor rather than a ··metastatic lesion, the 
pathologic stage is assessed as pT2NO.

   Gross Description:  
Received are six separate formalin filled containers each l abeled with the  
patient's  name.  
 
Part A is additionally labeled ""A, level VII lymph node."" The specimen consists  
of a single fragment of gray -black soft tissue that has dimensions of 1 x 0.8 x  
0.3 cm. Submitted in toto in cassette A.  
 
Part B is additionally labeled ""B, right upper lobe mass."" Please note a portion  
of this tissue has been banked at the tissue bank and a portion has been  
sent to diagnostics . The specimen consists of a previously incised and  
sectioned portion of lung wedge that has overall reconstructed dimensions of  9 x 
3.5 x 3.5 cm. The pleural surface ranges from pink -tan, smooth and glistening to  
purple- red-brown and focally hemorrhagic. Upon sectioning, there is a solid,  
ill-defined, tan- white mass that has dimensions of 3 x 2.5 x 2 cm. This mass  
grossly comes to within 0.1 cm from the pleural surface but does not appear  
grossly to be penetrating the pleura. This mass is grossly present at the  
stapled surgical margin. A representative section of this mass is taken for  
frozen section diagnosis and is resubmitted entirely in cassette B1. Additional  
sections of mass to include pleura are submitted in cassettes B2- 3. Sections of  
tumor to staple line in cassette B4. The uninvolved lung is tan- brown and spongy  
to focally red, hemorrhagic and congested. No additional lesi ons are identified  
within this portion of lung. Representative section of uninvolved lung in  
cassette B5.  
 
Part C is additionally labeled ""C, right upper lobe margin."" The specimen consists of a lung wedge that has dimensions of 11 x 2 x 1.5 cm. There is a  
surgical staple line traversing one aspect of the specimen. The pleura surface 
ranges from tan- gray, smooth and glistening to red- brown, granular and  
hemorrhagic. There is an area designated by the surgeon at the time of frozen  
section as the previous sit e nearest the tumor. This area is frozen at the time 
of frozen section and is resubmitted in cassette C1. Additional sectioning of  
the wedge reveals an ill -defined, tan- brown mass present at the margin. This  
mass has dimensions of 2 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm. An addi tional section of this mass is  
submitted in cassette C2.  
 
Part D is additionally labeled ""D, 4R lymph node"" and consists of a single  
fragment of gray -tan fibrofatty soft tissue that has dimensions of 0.4 x 0.3 x  
0.2 cm. Submitted in toto in cassette D.  
 Part E is additionally labeled ""E, 2R lymph node"" and consists of two fragments  
of gray -yellow fibrofatty soft tissue that have overall dimensions of 0.8 x 0.5  
x 0.3 cm. Submitted in toto in cassette E.  
 Part F is additionally labeled ""F, right upper lobe margin #2, stitch marks

Results 
Sample Preparation 
For cytology samples, extraction of DNA was performed from the fluid or sample provided. For surgical specimens, 
microdissection was performed to include neoplastic tissue and normal adjacent tissue, O~tical density readings were obtained. 
Gene Seguencing 
peR was performed using primers that flank exon 1 in the KRAS gene and exon 19 and 21 of the EGFR gene, Analysis of the 
peR products was first performed for the EGFR 19 to detect aberrant length peR product. A sequencing analysis, using the 
Big Dye Terminator Kit (Applied 8iosystems, Inc,) was then performed, The known hotspots were analyzed for the presence of 
mutations, 80th forward and the reverse seqllencin~ was performed.

 Microscopy 
Re 1.) Immediate intraoperative evaluation ): metastasis of squamous cell carcinoma. 
After paraffin embedding. 
Lymph node sections with extensive infiltration by atypical epithelia arranged in differing sizes of partly 
branched and vaguely epidennoid or concentrically layered solid structures. Moderately wide to wide, pale to 
moderately eosinophilic cytoplasm. Focally recognizable intercellular bridges. Nuclei round to oval, partly with 
somewhat inegular contours, mostly moderately, but focally also markedly anisomorphic, with enlarged 
chromatin, differing sizes of nucleoli and numerous mitoses. Surrounding desmoplastic stroma. Small focal 
inclusion of necrosis. 
Re 2.) Immediate intraoperative evaluation ): squamous cell dysplasia up to severity of a squamous 
cell carcinoma in situ with spread to bronchial glands, no evidence of invasive growth rapid sections. 
After paraffin embedding. 
Tumor made up of atypical epithelia described in 1.). Focal dyskeratoses or vague pearly bead formation. 
Isolated nuclei also deformed. Multifocal necroses of differing extent. Middle lobe bronchus segmentally 
obstructed by the tumor and in large pa1ts destroyed, here continuous infiltration of para bronchial lymph nodes. 
Spread to the visceral pleura, which is markedly enlarged by fibrosis in parts, but not unequivocally infiltrated. 
In many places invasion of small blood vessels in the tumor and tumor margin. Proximal to the tumor 
obstruction in the middle lobe bronchus and also at the bronchus resection margin partial replacement of the 
respiratory epithelium by enlarged atypical squamous epithelium extending to the secretory ducts and bronchial 
glands with the squamous disorder mostly reaching well into the upper third or to the surface. Nuclei irregularly 
arranged, in most cases slightly to moderately anisomorphic, but with foci of relatively marked anisomorphism, 
and formation here and there of keratin lamellae and pearly beads. Vessel resection margins and hilar lymph 
nodes tumor-free. In S5 incompletely inflated alveolar lung tissue in parts with relatively extensive intraalveolar 
erythrocyte extravasates. 
Otherwise in many places the alveolar lumina and partly also the lumina of bronchioles are occupied with 
moderately dense macrophages, some transformed into foam cells, some pale brown and with frne granular 
blackish pigmentation. In multifocal parabronchial vessels and in interlobular septa lymph follicles and small 
patches of relatively dense lymphomonocytic infiltrates. In SIO mostly only a few intraalveolar macrophages. 
Re 3.) Immediate intraoperative evaluation (  resection margin to main bronchus + upper lobe 
bronchus in each case tumor-free and free of dysplastic epithelial lesions. 
After paraffin embedding: 
Bronchial sections with focal replacement of respiratory epithelium by immature squamous epithelium at the 
margin to the main and upper lobe bronchus. Stroma with increase in elastic fibers. To some extent somewhat 
prominent seromucous glands. Strands of typical hyaline cartilage. Close to the distal resection margin only 
sections of atypical squamous epithelium preserved or registered at the surface as described under 2.), here 
likewise focal spread in glandular ducts. 
Re 4.) -7.) Lymph nodes with intact basic structure, inconspicuous lymphatic cell content with formation of 
activated follicles and slight to moderate deposits of blackish granular pigment and some small anisotropic 
particles within macrophages. 
EVALUATION 
Primary diagnosis/diagnoses: relatively large, central to peripheral bronchopuhnonary, histologically 
moderately differentiated, large-cell, slightly keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma of the middle lobe. 
TNM classification pT2 pNJ. VI RO, stage IIB. 
C 34.2 M 8070/3 
Secondary diagnosis/diagnoses: slight chronic retention pneumonia peripheral to the tumor in S5. Lymph 
nodes with uncharacteristic reactive lesions and anthracotic pigment deposits (samples 2.) and 4.)-7.)). 
Remark/addendum: the tumor shows obliterative segmental growth in the middle lobe bronchus and has 
spread to the mucosal surface right to the central bronchus resection line of sample 2.) and to the distal sections 
of repeat bronchial resection material in sample 3.). The resection margin tot he main and upper lobe bronchus 
of sample 3.) is free of dysplastic epithelial changes. Lymph node metastases are seen in sample 1.) and 
parabronchially in sample 2. ). The other lymph nodes removed and the vessel resection margins of the main 
preparation are tumor-free. An unequivocal infiltration of the visceral pleura cannot be demonstrated.

MACROSCOPIC 
Four specimens received 
1: The specimen is labelled 'left upper lobe' and consists of a lobe of lung (132 x 85 x 
70), weighing 381 grams in the fixed state. Adherent to the visceral surface is a strip 
of parietal pleura measuring 127 x 52 mm. Within the parenchyma is a large cream 
tumour mass. The tumour comprises a relatively circumscribed cream nodule with 
areas of necrosis (57 mm in maximum diameter), merging with an ill-defined firm 
cream to tan area. The maximum diameter of the entire lesion (discrete nodule plus 
ill-defined area) measures 91 mm. The tumour invades visceral pleura and is adherent

2: The specime n is labelled 'right lung lower and middle' and consists of the right middle and lower 
lobes as stated. The lower lobe measures 155 x 100 x 40 nun and the middle lobe 135 x 90 x 30 mm. 
There is a stapled resection margin along the middle lobe, 150 mm in length. A rounded endobronc hial 
tumour plug extends to the bronchial resection margin, however there is no attachment to the bronchial 
wall in this region. The pleural surface appears indurated and tethered on the anterior apical part of the 
lower lobe over an area approximately 25 x 30 mm. Sectioning reveals a tumour within the apical 
segment of the lower lobe measuring 50 x 45 x 45mm with endobronchial extension up to a distance of 
40mm. The entire lesion measuring approximately 75mm in maximal dimension . The endobronchial 
plug of tumour extends to involve the proximal portion of the middle lobe bronchus and is focally 
tethered to the wall at this point. The alveolated parenchyma of the middle lobe appears clear of 
tumour and no tumour is present at the stapled resection margin. The endobronchia l plug of tumour 
also extends up the bronchus to the bronchial resection margin. However, as mentioned previously the 
tumour is not attached to the bronchial wall in this region. A peribronchial lymph node appears to be 
involved by tumour, possibly by direct extension. The bronchial and peribronchial resection margins 
appear macroscopically clear of the tumour. Localised broncruectasis is present distal to the 
endobronchial tumour plug. [2A, 5 hilar lymph nodes; 2B, bronchial resection margin en face; 2C-D,

2: Sections reveal a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma involving the apical segment of the 
right lower lobe with extensive endobronchial extension. The tumour does not invade the visceral 
pleura. The bronchial resection margin is clear of tumour. Tumour extends into peribronchial 
connective tissue adjacent to the resection margin but is 0.3mm clear of the peribronchial resection 
margin. Within peribronchial connective tissue in this region perineural penneation by turnOUT is 
identified. The involved nerve measures 350um in diameter and in the section examined is 1.3mm

nodes also show evidence of sinus histiocytosis, carbon pigment deposition, fibrosis and scattered 
flecks of birefringent material consistent with silicate. Within adjacent lung parenchyma there is 
bronchiectasis with mucoid plugging and focal endogeno us lipoid pneumonia consistent with 
obstructive pneumonitis. The seclion of right middle lobe alveolated lung parenchyma shows  bronchiectasis with mucoid plugging, however no tumour is identified. Rare mixed duct macules are 
present within the remaining alveolated lung parenchyma which is otherwise unremark able.

carbon pigment deposition, fibrosis and scattered flecks of birefringent material consistent wilh silicate. 
No tumour is identified. 
SUMMARY 
1-3: Right lower and middle lobes, separately submitted No. 7 lymph node: 
Poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma involving the apical segment of the right lower lobe. 
Tumour size 75mm in maximal dimension. 
Extensive endobronchial extension by tumour, endobronchia l tumour attached at origin of right middle 
lobe bronchus (macroscop ic finding). 
Visceral pleura nol involved. 
Resection margins clear of tumour. 
Perineural penncation by tumour within peribronchial tissue adjacent to margin (see microscopic 
description). 
Lymphatic invasion present 
No vascular invasion seen. 
Peribronchial lymph node involved by tumour, no tumour in separately submitted No.7 lymph node. 
Pathological stage: T2 N I. 
Bronchiectasis and focal endogenous lipoid pneumonia in adjacent lung parenchyma. 
T-28000 M-80703 PI-03000 
"," Site: Right lower and middle lobes
Justification: The specimen includes tissue from these two lung lobes and the pathology report describes tumor involvement in both locations.

Laterality: Right
Justification: The description of the specimen and the pathology report consistently refer to structures on the right side of the body, e.g., ""right lower lobe"" and ""right middle bronchus.""

Histology: Poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma
Justification: The pathology report states that the tumor is a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma.

Stage: T2 N1
Justification: The pathology report describes the tumor as having a maximal dimension of 75 mm, invading peribronchial connective tissue but not the visceral pleura, and involving a peribronchial lymph node. These features are consistent with a T2 N1 stage.

Grade: Not provided
Justification: The pathology report does not provide information on the grade of the tumor.

Behavior: Malignant
Justification: Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of lung cancer that is typically malignant, and the pathology report describes extensive endobronchial extension and lymphatic invasion, which are also indicative of malignancy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

M
ain diagnosis/diagnoses:  
Very extensive, pneumonia-like, imposing bronchopulmonary mixed adenocarcinoma with a 
predominantly tubulopapillary and bronchioloalveolar pattern, as well as slight mucin formation and formation of numerous, in parts very s mall foci within the parenchyma and 
minimal pleural invasion and lymphogenous metastatic spread.   
Comment/supplementary remark:   
By definition, the foci of mixed adenocarcinoma detected not only in the immediate 
environment of the tumor, but in some cases only at microscopic level, are to be classified satellite nodes in the ipsilateral lobe, which -  bearing in mind the location of the lymph node micrometastases (samples 5.), 7.) and very probably also 1.)), as well as the absence of tumor in the resectio n margins of the bronchus and the vessels - gives a tumor classification of pT4 
pN1 R0. But in view of the presentation of the tumor and the partial bronchioloalveolar differentiation, the interpretation can be just as easily be supported or perhaps even f avored 
that this is a primary multifocal tumor manifestation. This would correspond to pT2(m). The stage grouping IIIB thus competes with IIB. The main tumor mass lies in segments 6 and 9 of the resected right lower lobe. The largest of the metastases foun d in the regional lymph nodes 
is 1.2 mm. The coding is C 34.3; M 8255/3.    
"," 1. ""Site"": Lung. Justified as the report clearly states the tumor is located in the right lower lobe.
2. ""Laterality"": Right. Justified as the report mentions the tumor is located in the right lower lobe.
3. ""Histology"": Mixed adenocarcinoma with a predominantly tubulopapillary and bronchioloalveolar pattern, and slight mucin formation. Justified as the report describes the tumor as a bronchopulmonary mixed adenocarcinoma with these specific characteristics.
4. ""Stage"": The report suggests two possible stages: pT4 pN1 R0 or pT2(m). As the final decision is not made, I would say ""not provided"".
5. ""Grade"": Not provided as the report does not mention any information about the differentiation of the tumor.
6. ""Behavior"": Malignant. Justified as the report mentions lymphogenous metastatic spread and partial bronchioloalveolar differentiation, indicating the tumor is invasive and has the ability to spread.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clinical Notes: 
Left upper lobectomy: apical lung carcinoma. 
Station 5 lymph node. 
Two specimens are received: 
1: LEFT UPPER LOBE 
Macroscopy: 
Specimen is labelled ""left upper lobe"" and consists of a lobe of lung measuring 180 x 100 x 40 mm. 
Enlarged peribronchial lymph nodes are seen at the resection margin. No endobronchial abnormality is 
seen. The pleural surface appears normal except for at the apex where there is a subpleural tumour 
measuring 30 mrn in maximum diameter. There is a fibrofatty adhesion, measuring 25 x 8 x 5 mrn, at 
the apical surface of the tumour. The tumour is moderately well circumscribed, solid and cream in 
colour witli numerous small areas of necrosis seen. Non-neoplastic parenchyma displays no 
abnormality. [Bronchial resection margin, A; peribronchial lymph nodes transected and BIT, B-D; RS 
of tumour, E-H; apical non-neoplastic parenchyma, I; lingula parenchyma, J]. 
Microscopy: 
Sections show a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma which invades the pleura in the region of the 
fibro fa tty adhesion. Vascular invasion is also noted. Focally the tumour has a cystic architecture with 
papillary infolding into the cyst lumen, but it is a predominantly solid tumour. There is extensive 
replacement of peribronchial lymph nodes by metastatic poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, and 
transcapsular extension of tumour is noted. Tumour emboli are noted in lymphatics in surrounding 
fibrofatty tissue. The bronchial resection margin is well clear of malignancy. Non-neoplastic lung 
parenchyma shows changes of respiratory bronchiolitis. 
2: NUMBER 5 LYMPH NODE 
Macroscopy: 
Specimen is labelled ""number 5 lymph node"" and consists of a lymph node measuring 20 mrn in 
maximum diameter. The cut surface shows a solid white nodule at one pole of the lymph node 
measuring 4 mrn in diameter. [Transected and BIT, 2A]. [

Lung nodule  
 MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:  
The specimen is received in six parts, each labeled with the  
patient's name.  
 1. Part one is received fresh, labeled 'left upper lobe'. It  
consists of an 11 x 7.5 x 3 cm lung wedge resection with a stapled  
margin measuring 7 cm in length. Two defects made by the surgeon are  
noted. The first defect measures 1.5 cm in length and the second  
defect measures 1.8 cm in length. The pleural surface is otherwise  
smooth and glistening. The surgical margin is inked black and the  
pleural surface is inked blue. In the first defect area, a 1.4 cm  
relatively well -circumscribed, tan- white, firm nodule, located 1.3  
cm from the surgical margin and 0.2 cm from the pleural surface is  
noticed. In the second defect, a 2 x 1 cm, tan- white, firm nodule is  
noted. This nodule is 1.5 cm from the surgical margin and 0.2 cm  
from the pleura. Other areas of lung parenchyma show patchy  
congestion. Representative sections are submitted.  
 
2. Part two is received in saline, labeled 'completion of left upper  
lobe'. It consists of a partial lobectomy measuring 18 x 7 x 3.5 cm.  
The specimen weighs 136 g. The specimen contains a stapled margin  
measuring 15 cm, which is inked in blue. After the stapled margin  
is removed, the underlying surface is inked in green. The pleural  
surface is inked in black. The specimen is serially sectioned and no  
 masses are identified. The lung parenchyma consists of tan- pink to 
tan-gray spongy parenchyma. Representative sections are submitted.  
 
3. Part three is received in saline, labeled 'station 13 lymph  
node'. It consists of two black lymph nodes measuring 1.6 x 1.2 x  
0.3 cm and 1 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm. The lymph nodes are bisected and  
entirely submitted in 3A.  
 4. Part four is received in saline, labeled 'level 9 lymph node'. It  
consists of two black lymph nodes, both measuring 0.8 x 0.5 x 0.2  
cm. The specimen is entirely submitted.  
 
5. Part five is received in saline, labeled 'level 5 lymph node'. It  
consists of three black lymph nodes ranging in size form 0.4 cm to 1.2 cm in greatest dimension. The specimen is submitted in toto. 
 6. Part six is received in saline, labeled 'level 7 lymph node'. It  
consists of one black lymph node measuring 1.2 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm. The 
lymph node is bisected and submitted entirely in 6A.

COMMENTS: 
The patient's history of prior renal cell carcinoma is noted. There is, however, no material identified in our files for review and comparison . Accordingly , 
a limited series of immunohistochemical stains is perfonned on a representat ive block of a malignancy . Sections are examined along with appropriate ly 
staining positive and negative controls, with the following results: 
CK7 -Positive. 
CK20 -Negative. 
TTF1-Positive. 
RCC-Negative. 
Histologically, the malignancy does not resemble a typical renal cell carcinoma , and the staining pattern above essentially excludes the possibility of a 
metastasis from the kidney, and is typical of a primary pulmonary adenocarcinoma. 
The malignanc y grossly approaches the stapled parenchyma l surgical margin to within less than 0.1 em. Following removal of the staple line, the inked 
margin in this site is involved by malignancy . It is noted, however, that the nature of the stapling procedure itself precludes sampling of the true final 
surgical margin. Clinical correlation is suggested .  CLINICAL HISTORY:

GROSS DESCRIPTION: 
The specimen is received in two formalin-filled containers labeled with the patient's name. 
A. Container A is additionally labeled ""right upper lobe,"" and contains a 16.0 x 8.5 x 2.8 em, lung lobe. The pleura is purple-pink , moderately anthracotic 
and glistening . A 10.0 x 3.5 em, area of exposed red-pink mucosa is present. Within this area are multiple exposed segments of bronchi and 
vasculature. Extending from both ends of this area are two serpiginous staple lines, each measuring 5.5 an in greatest dimension. The staple line is 
removed and the underlying parenchyma is inked black. Additionally, the exposed bronchi and vascular margins are taken en face, and the exposed 
parenchyma is also inked black.. The bronchi feature yellow-tan , striated endothelium with no discrete lesions. Sectioning reveals a 2.5 x 1.5 x 1.5 em, 
well circumscribed , yellow-tan, firm glistening mass that resides 0.4 em below the blue-inked pleura, and approaches to within less than 0.1 cm of the 
closest stapled parenchymal margin. The remainder of the cut surface is pink-tan and focally congested. No additional lesions are identified. Seven iU­
defined black anthracotic nodules are identified consistent with p;tr~hrnnrhi::tl l\fIT\ph nodes. They range from 0.1 up to 0.3 em in greatest dimension . 
Representative sections are submitted in cassettes A 1-8, labeled designated as follows: 1 -bronchial and vascular margins, en face; 2-3 -

PATHOLOGY
PART #1: RIGHT UPPER LOBE
Resident Pathologist:
The specimen is received fresh labeled and designated
right upper lobe. It consists of one grossly identifiable fragment
of fleshy hemorrhagic tissue consistent with lung. A long black
suture which does not designate anything in particular is attached to
the specimen. The specimen weighs 66 grams and measures 10 x 6.5 x 4
cm.A palpable massis identified in the parenchyma. The overlying
pleura is inked with black ink. Serially sectioning the lung reveals
a 2.5 cm tumor massthat is white tan and firm around the edges and
slightly necrotic and hemorrhagic in the center. Tumor and normal
lung are collected for the tumor bank and for lab for
further studies. A tied off vessel is grossly identified. This
vessel is sampled and assumed to be a vascular margin. A long
parenchymal staple margin is grossly identified in the specimen in the
shape of a Y. This margin measures 9 cm at its longest aspect and
there is also an arm of the staple margin that measures 4.2 cm. The
tumormass appears to grossly abut the pleura. However, the tumor
massis located approximately 1.6 cm from the closest staple margin.
This staple margin is shaved and submitted in its entirety. The shave
suture margin is submitted in cassettes B-D.Sections are taken of
the tumor mass.Sectioning through the remainder of the lung
parenchyma does not reveal any other mass lesions. Sections of normal
lung are submitted. Additionally received with the specimen is a small
fragment of rib. This rib measures 2.1 x 1.4 x 0.3 cm. Adherent
fibrous tissue is identified on the outer aspect of the rib. Focal
areasof blood clot are also identified on the outer surface of the
rib.No gross abnormalities are identified. No sections are
submitted. The rib is a gross diagnosis only.

Macroscopy 
1.) Left lung: In filled, fixed condition, left lung of 16 x 11 em in size at base and up to 28 em high, central bronchial 
resection line 3 em proximal to the branch of the upper lobular bronchus. On the hilum, six blackish and partially 
damaged nodes of between 0.4 and 2.2 em in size. The dorsal portion of the gap between the lobes has been largely 
obliterated. In this region, covering an area of approx. 9 em, pleura unclearly delimited and discolored whitish, 
thickened, with flat retraction. Below this, with its main mass located in the border regions of segments 6 and 8-10, a 
moderately solid, pale brownish tumor with unclear demarcation and max. 7.8 em in size. Eccentrically, a malacic area of 
approx. 3.5 em in size. No demonstrable connection to bronchial branches that can be dissected out. Tumor extends as 
far as the pleura in the region of the retraction and approx. 1.5 em deep into the upper lobe in the region of 54. 
Parenchyma indurated peripheral to the tumor and yellow-brownish in color. Color of the rest of the lung tissue normal. 
2.) Left hilar LN (station 10): Gray-blackish node of 2 em in size. 
3.) Left pulmonary ligament LN (station 9): Damaged, gray-blackish node of 1.5 em in size. 
4.) Left paraesophageal LN (station 8): Gray-blackish node of 5 em in size with some surrounding tissue. 
5.) Subcarinal LN (station 7): Gray-blackish node of 9 mm in size. 
6.) Paraaortic LN (station 6): Damaged, gray-blackish node of 8 mm in size. 
7.) Subaortic LN (aortopulmonary window) (station 5): Gray-blackish node of 8 mm in size with some surrounding tissue.

Investigated: 
1.) Tumor with lung parenchyma in margin, tumor with pleura, tumor with gap between lobes (upper lobe stained), 
central bronchial resection line, vascular resection margins (11arger one split in half+ separate in lungs), 
2.)-9.) in each case, entire material (split in half for 8.), 
14 blocks, in some cases , PAS, diastaseRPAS. 
 Microscopy 
on 1.) Tumor structure composed of variably sized, partially branched, solid, focal atypical epidermoid epithelia, also 
focally arranged in trabecular groups. Moderately eosinophilic cytoplasm of intermediate width to wide, partially 
extended lengthways to spindly. Focal intercellular bridges. Nuclei round to oval, up to strongly anisomorphic, with 
coarse chromatin, mainly small to moderately large nucleoli and relatively numerous mitoses. Extensive necroses. 
Desmoplastic tumor stroma and groups of the atypical epithelia infiltrated with mixed inflammatory cells or 
predominantly with granulocytes. Expansion of the atypical epithelia across the fibrosed obliterated interlobular gap 
into the neighboring segments of the upper lobe. Dissected visceral pleura also focally infiltrated and notably strongly 
fibrously expanded here, as well as with superficial fibrin precipitates that are both external and incorporated. Sections 
of the tumor margins with up to high densities of intraalveolar granulocytes and macrophages, alveolar septa sometimes 
with strong edematous-fibrous expansion and infiltrated with mixed inflammatory cells, as well as surrounded by 
proliferated pneumocytes. Resection margin of bronchus and vessels as well as hilar lymph nodes free of tumors. The 
latter with normal lymphate. Cells with development of numerous activated follicles, minor to moderate deposits of 
fine-grained blackish pigments and fewer anisotropic particles within macrophages, as well as partially with nodular, 
fibrous zones with few spindle cells and, in sections, old necrotic zones, sometimes with the inclusion of planar calcium 
salt precipitates and focally minimal bony tissue. 
on 2.)-S.), 7.), + 9.) Lymph nodes as described under 1.). 
on 6.) Incompletely filled peripheral lung tissue with, at the level of the visceral pleura, small, sometimes squashed 
lymph nodes with normal lymphatic cells and more extended aggregates of macrophages with minor deposits of 
blackish, grainy pigment. 
on 8.) Peripheral lung tissue with subpleurally expanded alveolar spaces and rarefied and enlarged alveolar septa. 
Mainly pleural, up to moderate deposits of blackish, grainy pigment within macrophages. 
EVALUATION 
Primary diagnosis/diagnoses: Large, peripheral, bronchopulmonary, partially necrotically altered, with poor 
differentiation histologically, nonkeratinizing squamous epithelial carcinoma (G3) of the left lower lobe of the lung, 
located in the border region of segments 6 and 8 to 10. 
TNM classification pT2 pNO RO, Stage lB. 
C 34.3 M 8070/3 
Secondary diagnosis/diagnoses: Active chronic pneumonia in the areas around the tumor and fibrinous inflammation of 
the visceral pleura with markedly fibrous expansion over the tumor. Lymph nodes in this region (samples 1.)-7.) and 
9.)) with abnormal reactive changes, anthracotic pigment deposits and sometimes partially calcified, old necrotic or 
ossified nodular sclerosed zones. Mild focal emphysema of the lung (sample 8.)). 
Remark/addendum: The carcinoma has expanded across the lobular gap into the neighboring sections of segment 4 of 
the upper lobe. The resection margin of the bronchus and vessels as well as all lymph nodes that were removed or those 
that were identified are tumor-free. "," Site: The site of the tumor is the left lower lobe of the lung, specifically in the border region of segments 6 and 8 to 10.

Laterality: The laterality of the tumor is on the left side of the body.

Histology: The histology of the tumor is a large, peripheral, bronchopulmonary, partially necrotically altered, with poor differentiation, nonkeratinizing squamous epithelial carcinoma (G3).

Stage: The stage of the tumor is T2 pNO RO, Stage IB.

Grade: The grade of the tumor is G3, which indicates high-grade malignancy.

Behavior: The behavior of this tumor is malignant, as it shows features of invasive carcinoma and has spread across the lobular gap into the neighboring sections of segment 4 of the upper lobe.

REPORT ON FINDINGS 
Macroscopy 
1.) Inflated, fixed right lung measuring 12 x 11 em at the base and np to 25 em in length, central bronchus 
resection plane located 1.2 em proximal to the bifurcation of the upper lobe bronchus. Upper pleural fissure 
extensively obliterated in dorsal third, over segment 6 and adjacent sections of S2 an 8.5 x 6 em area of parietal 
pleura is extensively adhesive. At the hilus are six partly lesioned mobile grayish-black nodes between 1.1 and 
2 em in size, lower lobe bronchus and proximal sections oflower lobe segmental bronchi largely obstructed by 
a central moderately solid, pale brownish, predominantly endobronchial tumor, max. 4.8 em in size, in the lower 
lobe. Involvement of several grayish-black pigmented nodes up to 1.4 em in size by the tumor. Central blood 
vessels partly narrowed by the tumor. Tumor spread across the pleural fissure questionably into the upper lobe. 
Sleeve-like spread along the lower lobe bronchus, with apparent involvement of a 2.2 em grayish-black node 
extending right up to the hilar resection surface. Intermediate and peripheral lower lobe bronchial branches are 
markedly dilated and filled with thick mucus. Parenchyma in segment 6 below the pleural adhesion is an 
indurated and pale brownish-yellow area of about 3.5 em with unclear demarcation, medial parenchyma in 
segment 3 and apical parenchyma in segment I rarefied with lacunae or lacuna systems of up to 0.5 em. Pleura 
over segment I shows whitish discoloration in several, partly striated areas of up to 5 em, underlying 
parenchyma here shows an indurated and grayish-white seam about 0.3 em thick. 
2.) Hilar LN (station 10) right: 2.6 em lesioned node or node part, section surfaces predominantly pale brown to 
whitish suggestive of a tumor. 
3.) Pulmonary ligament LN (station 9) right: two lesioned grayish-black nodes with some surrounding tissue, 
0.3 and 1.2 em in size. 
4.) Paraesophageal LN (station 8) right: five lesioned grayish-black nodes or node parts between 0.3 and 1.2 
em. 
5.) Snbcarinal LN (station 7): 2 em node part with pale brown to whitish section surfaces suggestive of a tumor. 
6.) Low paratracheal LN (station 4) right: 3.5 em lesioned node with predominantly pale brown to whitish 
section surfaces suggestive of a tumor. 
7.) Retrotracheal right: 1 em lesioned grayish-black node with some snrronnding tissne. 
8.) High paratracheal LN (station 2) right: five lesioned grayish-brown nodes or node parts between 0.1 and I 
em. 
9.) Hilar LN (station (St.! 0) left: 2.5 em lesioned node or node part, section surfaces pale brown to whitish 
suggestive of a tumor. 
10.) Low paratracheal LN (station 4) left: 1.5 em five lesioned grayish-brown node with some surrounding 
tissue. 
II.) High paratracheal LN (station 2) left: 1.1 em lesioned grayish-brown node with some sun·ounding tissue, 
section surfaces pale brown to whitish . 
 Examined: 
1.) Tumor with rest of parenchyma+ proximal branch ofBJO, 2 sections of tumor with lower lobe bronchus+ 
involved nodes, 2 sections with pleural fissure to upper lobe (upper lobe portion partly color-marked), 2 
sections main bronchus at birfurcation of lower lobe bronchus with node close to hilus (hilar resection surface 
color-marked), SIO intermediate, S6 at junction of S2, Sl apical, S3 medial, S2 dorsal, central bronchus 
resection plane+ resection margins of vessels, hilar nodes,

Description of histological and cytological findings omitted for capacity reasons. 
EVALUATION 
Primary diagnosis/diagnoses: 
Central bronchopulmonary, histologically poorly to moderately differentiated, partly keratinizing squamous cell 
carcinoma of the lower lobe of the right lung with marked lymphogenic metastasization. 1NM classification 
according to this picture pT2 pN3 VI RO, stage lllB. C 34.3; M 8070/3. G3. 
Secondary diagnosis/diagnoses: 
Largely organized pneumonic infiltrate with fibrous parenchymal remodeling in S6 and old thromboses of 
adjacent small pulmonary arteries. Flat subpleural parenchymal scar in apical Sl with slight perifocal 
emphysema. Circumscribed high-grade emphysematous stromal remodeling with formation of small cysts in 
segments I and 3. Minimal mixed dust deposits in lung parenchyma and accumulation of alveolar siderophages 
with possible respiratory bronchiolitis. Pleural fibrosis especially over the fibrous remodeling area in S6 with 
adhesion. Tumor-free lymph nodes with slight to moderate pigment deposits and in some cases reactive 
follicular hyperplasia. 
Remark/addendum: 
On the one hand, the carcinoma is spreading to central segmental bronchi of the lower lobe by completely 
infiltrating and obliterating these, while growing into the lower lobe bronchus. On the other hand, the tumor 
extends to the pleura fissure. The angioinvasion does not affect small arteries and veins in the tumor area. Most 
of the 30 lymph nodes found are infiltrated with metastases, and they are not only detected in the tumor area 
and the hilus region, while the lymph node metastasis the near the main bronchus extends to within 0.5 mm of 
the mediastinal resection surface, but they are also found in the lymph node areas registered under 2.), 5.), 6.) 
and 8.)-II.). "," Site: Right lower lobe of the lung
Justification: The primary diagnosis specifies the location of the tumor as the right lower lobe of the lung.

Laterality: Right
Justification: The primary diagnosis mentions the tumor's location in the right lung, and several lymph node stations are also specified as right-sided.

Histology: Poorly to moderately differentiated, partly keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma
Justification: The primary diagnosis describes the tumor as a central bronchopulmonary, histologically poorly to moderately differentiated, partly keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma.

Stage: IIIB (pT2 pN3 VI RO)
Justification: The primary diagnosis provides the TNM classification of the tumor, which includes pT2 (tumor size and invasion), pN3 (extensive lymph node metastasis), and RO (no residual tumor). This information allows for the determination of stage IIIB.

Grade: G3
Justification: The primary diagnosis mentions that the tumor is a grade G3 carcinoma, indicating high-grade malignancy.

Behavior: Malignant
Justification: The primary diagnosis describes the tumor as a squamous cell carcinoma with marked lymphogenic metastasis, which indicates aggressive behavior and poor prognosis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1. Site: Right lower lobe of the lung
The report mentions a right lower lobectomy and describes two masses in the superior and basal aspects of the right lower lobe.
2. Laterality: Right
As described above, all the findings pertain to the right side of the body.
3. Histology: Invasive moderately differentiated non-keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma
The report describes two masses in the right lower lobe that are characterized as invasive moderately differentiated non-keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma.
4. Stage: pT2NOMx (for each tumor) or pT4NOMx (if one tumor represents an invasion from another primary site)
The report notes that the two tumors may represent synchronic primaries and suggests staging them as pT2NOMx, or alternatively, if one tumor represents an invasion from another primary site, it would be staged as pT4NOMx.
5. Grade: Not provided
The report does not mention the grade of the tumors.
6. Behavior: Malignant
As a cancer diagnosis, the behavior is malignant and invasive.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

    PRE- OP DIAGNOSIS:  Lung cancer. 
 
GROSS DESCRIPTION 
             A.  Submitted fresh for tissue procurement labeled ""left 
             upper lobe"" is a lobe of lung tissue which has been 
    amputated at the level of its principle bronchus and blood vessels. 
    The bronchial profiles that are present consists of three bronchi, 
    each approximately 8 to 9 mm across. They are grossly unremarkable. 
    Some vascular stumps are present at the point of amputation as well. 
    There is some anthracotic tissue present which  may represent some 
    hilar lymph nodes.  The visceral pleural surface of the lobe is 
    intact although there is a small area of adhesion and thickening 
    overlying an obviously large intraparenchymal tumor mass.  The 
    remainder of the parenchyma is anthracotic without focal lesion. 
    The lung was serially sectioned and this reveals a very large tumor 
    mass present in the center of the lobe which has a extensively 
    necrotic center. The tumor mass measures maximally 6 cm. across. 
    There is a rim of granular brown black tumor tissue present which 
    appears to extend to the visceral pleural surface. The center of the 
    tumor is necrotic with a creamy yellowish red appearance.  Fresh 
    tissue from normal lung is submitted for procurement as per 
    request of  Sections through the remainder of the lung 
    show no othe esions. Sections after fixation. 
 
    BLOCK SUMMARY:  1 - Bronchial and vascular margins; 2 - possible

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION 
             Microscopic sections of the left upper lobe tumor reveals a 
             squamous cell carcinoma which has variable histology. 
    Portions of the tumor are moderately differentiated and show 
    evidence of keratinization and well- defined intracellular bridges. 
    Other parts of the tumor have a sarcomatoid appearance and focally 
    develop a biphasic appearance with moderately differentiated 
    squamous carcinoma and spindle cell elements intermingling in a 
    carcinosarcomatous- like pattern. The finding of the histology is 
    present in the following template. 
      
  
  
    Histologic type:  Squamous cell carcinoma. 
    Histologic grade:  Poorly differentiated. 
    Primary tumor (pT):  6 cm mass which does not involve the visceral 
    pleural surface (pT2). 
    Margins of resection:  Negative. 
    Direct extension of tumor:  Absent. 
    Venous (large vessel) invasion:  Negative. 
    Arterial (large vessel) invasion:  Negative. 
    Lymphatic (small vessel) invasion:  Negative. 
    Regional lymph nodes (pN):  Two peribronchial lymph nodes and the 
    level 5 lymph node (part B) are negative for metastatic carcinoma. 
                                (pN0) 
    Distant metastasis (pM):  Could not be assessed.  (pMX)

DIAGNOSIS 
    A.  Lung, left upper lobectomy: 
          Invasive, poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma with 
          focal sarcomatoid features. 
          The tumor does not involve the visceral pleural surface. 
          Bronchial and vascular margins of resection are free of 
          tumor. 
          Two bronchial lymph nodes negative for metastatic carcinoma 
          (0/2). 
 
    B.  Lymph node, level 5, resection: 
          Fibrofatty tissue and sclerotic lymph node tissue negative for 
    metastatic carcinoma.

Two specimen s received: 
1: RIGHT UPPER LOBE 
Macroscopy: 
The specimen is labelled ""right upper lobe"" and consists of a lobe of lung measuring approximately 
165 x 100 x 55 mm in the inflated state. There are two staple lines present on the medial aspect of the 
specimen . Both of these are excised and the resultant margins inked with black ink . The lateral pleural 
surface is puckered over an area measuring approximately 15 x 6 mm. On sectioning through the lung 
parenchyma there is a firm cream nodule present deep to this puckering which measures 45 mm in 
greatest dimension. This lesion appears to abut the overlying pleura and is 21 mm from the nearest 
parenchymal resection margin. No endobronchial component of the lesion is identified 
macroscopicall y. The adjacent lung parenchyma appears unremarkable. [RS taken through bronchial 
and vascular resection margins-l A; peribronchial lymph node-IB; tumour with overlying pleural 
surface IC-IE; parenchymal resection margin-IF; section through adjacent uninvolved lung-IG.] 
Microscopy : 
Sections show a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. The lesion is subpleural and the tumour 
invades into but not through the visceral pleura. There is no blood vessel invasion and no lymphatic 
permeation is seen. No perineural permeation is identified . The lesion is well clear of the bronchial 
and the surgical resection margin. A peribronchial lymph node metastasis of adenocarcinoma is seen. 
Abutting the carcinoma in block 1 F is a carcinoid tumourlet. The adjacent lung shows very mild 
centriacinar emphysema . The bronchial resection margin shows mild active chronic inflammation and 
squamous metaplasia. 
2: HILAR LYMPH NODE 
Macroscopy : 
The specimen is labelled ""hilar lymph node"" and consists of two pieces of dark tan tissue measuring in 
aggregate 16 x 8 x 3 mm. [BIT-2A.]

Comment: 
This patient has a history of a prior laryngeal T4 squamous cell carcinoma. We have reviewed the tumor in the lung and the tumor of the larynx, and the tumors appear similar, with the laryngeal 
tumor showing slightly less squamous differentiation. It is not 
possible to determine if the tumor in the lung represents metastatic disease or a new primary. Review of the clinical workstation reveals that the multidicsiplinary thoracic oncology 
conference favored a new primary lung cancer.

Gross Description: 
There is one container labeled with the patient's name, ""   "" and 
additionally labeled ""right lower lobe, check bronchial margins"".   The specimen 
is received without fixative and consists of a lower lobe of right lung, 
measuring 16.4 x 10.7 x 4.6 cm. and weighing 230.0 gm.   The pleura shows marked 
anthracosis.   There is a palpable mass at approximately mid portion of the lobe, 
with umbilication of the overlying pleura on the lateral surface of the lobe. 
This umbilicated region is inked black.   The bronchovascular stumps are 
identified in the hilar aspect.   They are opened distally to reveal no 
intraluminal lesions.   Serial sections show that the mass is 5.0 cm. from the 
apex of the lobe and measures 4.9 x 3.7 x 3.5 cm.   It is irregularly shaped and 
has a tan-gray soft cut surface with necrosis and anthracotic pigment 
deposition.   There is no gross invasion of associated bronchovascular 
structures.   Five peribronchial lymph nodes are identified, measuring from 0.7 
cm. up to 1.1 cm. All lymph nodes show severe anthracosis.   The bronchial margin 
is shaved and submitted for frozen section.   Portions of the mass and normal 
lung parenchyma are also submitted for tissue banking.   Representative sections 
are submitted as follows: cassette ""1"" bronchial margin, for frozen section; 
cassette ""2"" vascular margins; cassettes ""3"" to ""5"" mass; cassette ""6"" random

HISTORY 
Adenocarcinoma. 
MACROSCOPIC 
Two specimens submitted. 
1: The first specimen is labelled 'left upper lobe' and consists of a lobe of lung 
measuring 200 x 80 x 20 mm in the fresh state. Overlying the apex and the lateral 
aspect of the apex of the lobe is an area of pleural tethering with an underlying tumour 
mass. The remainder of the pleural surface shows no specific abnonnality apart from 
extensive carbon pigmentation. The lobar bronchus has been transected t1ush with the 
hilar soft tissue and has two lumens at this point. Small peribronchial anthracotic 
nodes are noted, none of which appears macroscopically to be involved by a tumour. 
Sectioning reveals an apical tumour mass which appears to be bilobed. The combined 
maximum size of this lesion is 32 mm. The more superior lobule is approximately 20 
mm in diameter and shows foci of central necrosis. The more lateral and inferior 
lesion is approximately 12 mm in diameter and has a solid cream to tan cut surface. 
In some areas the lobules appear to be separated by 2 to 3 mm of unremarkable lung 
parenchyma. Both lobules abut the overlying pleura. No other lesions are identified 
on serial slicing through the parenchyma. However there is severe emphysema. [1 A, 
bronchial resection margin; 1 B, peribronchial lymph nodes; 1 C-I D longitudinal 
sections through tumour including overlying pleura and both lobules; IE, sections of 
inferolateral solid nodule with overlying pleura; 1 F, uninvolved lung parenchyma.] 
2: The second specimen is labelled 'left hilar lymph node' and consists of three 
ts of focally anthracotic and fatty tissue. [BIT,2A.] 
MICROSCOPY 
1: Sections show two adenocarcinomas. The first has a predominantly acinar architecture with a small 
amount of surrounding bronchioloalveolar type growth. Ext~nsive blo.od vessel invasion is noted and 
there is possible lymphatic penneatioll : The other lesion is a papillary adenocarcinoma. The lesions 
are separated by approximately 5 inm by unremarkable lung. A third focus of adenocarcinoma with a 
bronchioloalveolar pattern is present within the random section oflung. This measures 5 mm in 
diameter. Overlying both tumours, there is scarring of the pleura and features suspicious for invasion. 
Special stains will be performed. No perineural permeation is identified. The lesion is well clear of the 
bronchial resection margin. No lymph node metastases are seen. The uninvolved lung shows evidence 
of emphysema. 
2: Sections of the lymph nodes show reactive changes only. There is no evidence of malignancy. 
SUMMARY 
1-2: Left upper lobe and left hilar lymph nodes: 
A: Three foci of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma; 20 mm (acinar), 12 mm (papillary) and 5 
mm (bronchioloalveolar) in maximal dimension. 
B: Extensive blood vessel invasion; probable lymphatic permeation but no perineural permeation 
present. 
C: Possible pleural invasion identified; special stains being performed; clear of bronchial margin. 
D: No lymph node metastases. 
E: TINO (awaiting pleural stains) 
F: Non-neop lastic lung: Mild emphysema.  SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT 
1: Tumour invades into the visceral pleura overlying the tumour 'with the acinar architecture . It is not 
definitely on the pleural surface. There is no invasion of the visceral pleura by the papillary carcinoma. 
Both tumours stain positively for CK 7 and TTF 1. CK 20 is negative. This in.dicates both lesions are 
pulmonary in origin but considering their different architecture as they appear to represent synchronous 
tumours. 
SUMMARY 
1-2: Left upper lobe and left hilar lymph nodes: 
A: Three foci of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma; 20 mm (acinar), 12 mm (papillary) and 5 
mm (bronchioloalveolar) in maximal dimension. 
B: Extensive blood vessel invasion; probable lymphatic permeation but no perineural permeation 
present. 
C: Visceral pleural invasion identified overlying the acinar pattern carcinoma; clear of bronchial 
margin. 
D: No lymph node metastases. 
E: T2 NO (acinar pattern carcinoma) TINO (papillary and bronchioloalveolar pattern carcinomas) 
F: Non-neoplastic lung: Mild emphysen:a.

Macroscopy: 
Specimen consists of a left upper lobectomy measuring 205 x 135 x 
approximately 60 mm and weighing 503 g in the fixed state. Situated within 
the upper part of the lobe there is a large mass present medially. The pleural 
surface overlying this mass appears intact. On sectioning through the lobe this 
mass measures approximately 72 mm in maximum dimension. It has a 
lobulated cream appearance on cut surface and comes to within 1 mm of the 
pleural surface. Tumour is present surrounding the segmental bronchus but 
does not appear to have eroded through ~he bronchial wall. The endobronchial 
resection margin is clear of tumour. On section ing through the remainder of 
the lung parenchyma there is anthracosis but no evidence of emphysema and 
no further lesions are identified. There is a small focus of cyst or bullous 
formation present at the apex. [RS tak<;:n through hilar lymph nodes, A and B;

Container labeled --.. -right lower lobe of lung"" is a 
206 gram portion ~ monary parench yma grossly 
consistent with right lower lobe of lung. The specimen as received 
is 16.1 x 10.5 x 5.0 cm. The margin of resection is a previously 
sectioned bronchi with multiple staple lines. The pleura is 
wrinkled tan gray to brown and anthracotic streaked with a few 
nodular gray tan plaques up to 0.1 cm. Noted in the apparent 
lateral aspect in the central portion of the specimen there is a 
previously sectioned area of indurated umbilication measuring on 
reconstruction approximately 2.4 x 2.0 x 1.8 cm. This has been 
previously sectioned to reveal a lobulated gray tan to brown nodular 
lesion which grossly appears to extend to but not through the pleura 
in this area. This appears at its nearest point approximately 3.6 cm 
from the nearest bronchial margin. The remaining parenchyma is 
slightly diffusely consolidated mottled gray tan to pink with 
anthracotic streaking and focal areas of gross emphysematous change.

Comments 
This is staged as a pT1 b lesion based on the size of 2.4 cm in 
greatest diameter . The final stage should be performed in 
conjunction with the clinical information . 
Sections of the tumor show a poorly differentiated large cell 
carcinoma . A panel of immunohistochemical stains is performed 
including CK5/6, p63, TTF1 and CK7 (with appropriate positive and 
negative controls ). The neoplastic cells are positive for TTF1 and 
CK7. The neoplastic celis are negative for CK5/6 and p63. The 
overall histolog ic appearance in conjunction with the 
immunohistochemical stains is consistent with a poorly 
differentiated adenocarcinoma . In addition, some dense eosinoph ilic 
collagenous scar tissue is present suggesting this may have 
represented a so-called scar carcinoma . The carcinoma extends up to 
but not into the visceral pleura, being separated from the pleural 
margin by less than 1 mm. Clinical correlation and follow up is 
recommended . 
At the request of the undersigned pathologist , these slides have

 ADDENDUM #2 : 
  EGFR Mutation Analysis 
  
 
 
Referring Physician:  
 Body Site: Left upper lobe of lung  Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma  
 RESULTS: No mutation detected.  
 INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified in the sample pr ovided 
for analysis. Fewer than 5% of non- small cell lung carcinoma  
patients without identifiable mutations are reported to be  
responsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies.   COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more tumor cellularity is optimal  
for this mutation analysis. The sample submitted showed 80% tumor 
cellularity upon pathologist review.  A frequently occurring sequence change 2361G>A (Q787Q) was identified. This polymorphism is known not to have clinical significance.  
 Mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with  
differential responsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapies. The objective response rate among patients with a sensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%.  This assay analyzes exons 18 -21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain; 
based on the current literature, most mutations in non- small- cell 
lung carcinoma (NSCLC) are expected to occur in these exons.  
Mutations present in less than 10-20% of extracted DNA may not be detected by this method. Mutation status in a sample may change during tumor progression or the course of therapy; therefore, this result cannot be used to infer the presence or absence of a mutation in another sample or sub-sample obtained from this tumor.  This test is validated for non- small cell lung carcinoma. The  
clinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types  
is unknown.  METHOD:  
Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tu mor is  
 selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified  
and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to 
exons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by bi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary elec trophoresis 
and fluorescence detection. False positive or negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

particular test is not considered a stand alone test and should be used only in the context of other diagnostic tes ts or clinical

KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS  
 
 
Referring Physician:  
Body Site: Left upper lobe of lung Specimen Type: Slides  
Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma  RESULTS: Wild -type gene.  
 INTERPRETATION:  
No mutations were identified at codons 12 and 13 of the KRAS gene.  COMMENT:  
Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to be associated with poor prognosis, and resistance to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies in patients with non -small- cell lung cancer (NSCLC). KRAS  
mutations occur in 15-30% of NSCLC patients and are strongly associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking history.  This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene; based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is vali dated for 
use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and codon 13 mutations in fresh, frozen, or formalin -fixed paraffin embedded tissue. In particular 
the test performance has been established in samples of colorectal  
cancer and non- small cell lung carcinoma which harbor these 
mutations, although several other tissues are also known to harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix, etc.).  
 Analysis of EGFR mutation or gene amplification status may provide additional information regarding this patient's probability of response to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies, if clinically indicated. See references.  
  METHOD/LIMITATIONS:  
Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is  
selected for analysis. DNA is isolat ed from the sample, quantified 
and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single 
 nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13; 
primer extension products ar e analyzed using capillary gel  
electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

Fluorescence In -Situ Hybridization (FISH)  
 
Body Site: Left upper lobe of Lung 
Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma  
  INTERPRETATION:  
Negative for a rearrangement involving the ALK gene.  Probe #Nuclei Examined % Positive Nuclei % Control values 2p23(ALK)V 100 0 <15.0 A total of 100 cells were scored.  
 FINDINGS: FISH was performed on paraffin embedded tissue sections using dual color break- apart probe to the ALK 
gene at 2p23. This probe flanks the entire gene. If a rearrangement involving ALK is present, inversion or translocation, one of the two probe signals separates as one red (orange) and one green signal. In  
this specimen, separated signals were present in 0.5% of the nuclei scored. Based on laboratory validation data, these results are within the normal limits.  
 COMMENTS: Three to four copies of ALK were observed in 27.0% of cells. This gain of intact ALK fusion hybridization signals  
represents an aneuploid population with extra copies of chromosomes 2/2p ALK region. Additional copies of ALK are not uncommon in NSCLCs, although the significance of extra copies of the ALK gene in lung carcinoma is unclear at this time (

xtensive, central to peripheral bronchopulmonary adenocarcinoma of histologically mixed 
differentiation (G3), comprising partly maturing tubuloglandular cells and partly medium to 
large cells and also clear cells, with part ial necrotic alteration, invasion of the large pulmonary 
vessels and the pleura. Tumor classification according to these findings pT2 pN1 V2 RX, stage IIB. C34.2; M 8255/3.   
Comment/supplementary remark:   
The tumor invasion of the large pulmonary vessels with formation of lumen -obstructing 
thrombi of polypoid growth extending beyond the resection margin is very unusual.. The wall 
adhesion of the carcinoma is minimally about 0.5 mm from the resection margin of the vessels. The RX situation is likely explain ed by the fact that the tumor plug causing 
intraluminal obstruction of the middle lobe also adheres to the wall at a site on the resection margin. In addition, the tumor invasion in the pleura extends focally as far as the surface of the pleura. The glandular maturation component is partly reminiscent of the fetal type of bronchopulmonary adenocarcinoma. The smoldering or recurrent pneumonia is likely to have been of retrostenotic origin. The lymph node with tumor is located in the hilus region immediately next to one of the tumor- infiltrated large pulmonary vessels

"," The text appears to be a series of commands or function calls related to a medical report, possibly for a tumor or cancer case. Here are the categories and my justification for each:

1. Site - This is the location in the body where the tumor originated. It's crucial for determining the type of cancer and the appropriate treatment.
2. Laterality - This refers to the side of the body affected by the tumor, which can be important in certain types of cancer such as breast or lung cancer.
3. Histology - This is the type of tissue where the tumor originated, such as epithelial, mesenchymal, or lymphoid tissue. It helps determine the type of cancer and the appropriate treatment.
4. Stage - This is a measure of how far the cancer has spread in the body, which determines the prognosis and treatment options.
5. Grade - This is a measure of how aggressive the cancer cells look under the microscope, which can help predict the behavior of the tumor.
6. Behavior - This refers to whether the tumor is benign or malignant, which has implications for treatment and prognosis.

Justification: These categories are commonly used in medical reports for tumors and cancer cases, and they provide essential information for determining the type of cancer, the appropriate treatment, and the prognosis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GROSS DESCRIPTION-
A.Received fresh is a 10.5 x 5.5:x 3,5 cm wedge resection of lung. A staple tine indicates the resection margin.
The pleural surface, smooth and pale tan-red, shows minimal anthracotic stippling. Located approximately 2 cm
from the staple line is a 1.0x 0.8 cm area of pleural puckering. Beneath the pleura is an ill-circumscribed mass
measuring approximately 2.. 0 x 1.8 x 1.2 cm. The periphery of the mass is. firm and gray, and the center is
cavitated, No additional masses are identified throughout the remaining parenchyma. Intraoperative touch
preparations are prepared. A small portion of the mass, as well as normal lung, is obtained for the
T'iree.sections of the mass with overlying. pleura (inked black) are submitted in Al-A3.
INTRAOPERATIVE TOUCH PREP DIAGNOSIS: Non-small cell carcinoma.
B.Received fresh is a 106 gram, 17 x 8.0 x 5.4 cm lobe of lung. The pleura exhibits minimal to moderate
anthracotic.stippling. Towards the center of the resection is a 9.0 x 5.5 cm defect in the pleura; representing the
prior wedge resection. The edges of the pleural defect are 1.5 cm or greater from the staple: liner Sections of the
lung reveal a spongy tan-red parenchyma with no additional masses. Near the bronchial margin (which. is 2.5 cm
or greater from the staple line) are several small anthracotic Lymph nodes: The bronchial margin is submitted for
frozen section in B1, representative sections of lung parenchyma in B2 and $3, and lymph nodes. in B4.

FINAL SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT
Comment: There are two discrete tumors, both of which
have an in situ ""bronchioloalveolar"" component.
The larger tumor is poorly differentiated and the
smaller tumor is moderately differentiated. In the
absence of lymphatic invasion and lymph node
involvement ,these are considered to be
synchronous primaries and thus staged
according to the larger tumor.

Clinical diagnosis and question 
Non-small-cell bronchial carcinoma of left upper lobe (moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma). 
Asbestos exposure. 
REPORT ON FINDINGS 
Macroscopy 
1.) Left upper lobe: inflated, fixed left upper lobe measuring 22 x 13 x max. 4.5 em, central bronchus resection 
plane located 0.4 em proximal to the division into bronchi of the apical group and lingular bronchus. At the 
hilus four nodes, 0.5 and 1.8 em in size. A 3.3 em long staple suture line runs from the hilus in a cranial 
direction. A 7 em long staple suture line runs from the hilus in a caudodorsal direction demarcating the basis of 
an adhesive piece of lung tissue measuring 6 x I em to about 1.5 em thick (from S6?). Visceral pleura shows 
patchy blackish pigmentation, in the medial region a focal patchy reddish-brown discoloration and in the region 
of the hilus brown to reddish material. At the dorsal margin over S4 pleura shows an approximately 4 em area 
of star-shaped retracted tissue. Under this is a whitish, patchy and pale yellowish tumor, max. 4.8 em in size, 
with a partly unclear, partly vaguely arcuate configuration. Truncation of subsegmental branches of B4 and 5 in 
the tumor. Questionable infiltration in the attached wedge-shaped lung specimen, distance from its staple suture 
line 0.6 em. Other lung section surfaces show patchy blackish pigmentation. 
2.) Lobar LN (station 12) left upper lobe: 1.5 em node. 
3.) Interlobar LN (station 11) left: 1,5 em node. 
4.) Hilar LN (station 10) left: 3 em node. 
5.) Paraesophageal LN (station 8) left: 0.7 em lesioned node with surrounding tissue. 
6.) Paraaortic LN (station 6) left: two node parts with surrounding tissue, 1 em and 0.4 em. 
7.) Subaortic LN (aortopulmonary window) (station 5) left: 1.2 em node. 
8.) Low paratracheal LN (station 4) left: two node parts with surrounding tissue, 1.2 em and 0.5 em. 
9.) Low paratracheal LN (station 4) right: 1 em node or node part.

EVALUATION 
Primary diagnosis/diagnoses: 
Intermediate to peripheral, histologically poorly differentiated, large-cell, nonkeratinizing squamous cell 
carcinoma of the left upper pulmonary lobe mainly located in S4. TNM classification according to this picture 
pT2 pNO pMX Vl RO, stage IB. C34.1,M8070/3. 
Secondary diagnosis/diagnoses: 
Active chronic retention pneumonia at the tumor margin (sample 1.)). Lymph nodes with reactive lesions and 
anthracotic pigment deposits (samples 1.) to 9.)). Remark/addendum: 
The carcinoma has infiltrated the visceral pleura also in the region of the adhesion site with the co-resected 
piece from the lower lobe of the lung. The resection margin of the bronchus and vessels, the parenchyma of the 
co-resected piece from the lower lobe of the lung and all excised lymph nodes are tumor-free. 
No asbestos bodies are found in the prepared section planes. But very much further-reaching investigations, 
especially dust analyses, are needed to determine the asbestos exposure of the lung. "," 1. Site: Lung (left upper lobe). Justification: The report clearly specifies the tumor location as the left upper lobe of the lung.
2. Laterality: Left. Justification: This is consistent with the report's description of the tumor being in the left upper lobe.
3. Histology: Large-cell, nonkeratinizing squamous cell carcinoma. Justification: The report states this as the primary diagnosis.
4. Stage: T2 pNO pMX V1 RO, stage IB. Justification: The report provides the TNM classification as pT2 pNO pMX V1 RO, stage IB.
5. Grade: Not provided. Justification: The report does not specify a grade for the tumor.
6. Behavior: Malignant. Justification: This is inherent in the diagnosis of carcinoma; it is a malignant tumor by definition.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gross Description:
A. The specimen is labeled left upper lobe and is received without fixative, It consists of a lobe of lung
.measuring I x 9. 3 x 6.0 crn and weighing 170 grams. The pleural surface is violet to pale red with
numerous string adhesions along the anterior surface and toward the basilar portion. The lateral apical
portion of the lobe has a mottled yellow-tan to pink to reddish violet appearance with thickening of the
pleura over an area measuring `.5 x 5 cm, The bronchial margin is identified and is removed as a thin
shave for en face frozen section, On dissection there is an apical tumor mass which is composed of tan to
pale yellow to pale red tissue and overall measures 5.5 x 5.2 x 4 cm, This tumor is centrally cavitary
containing blood clot. This lesion is grossly 0.5 cm from the bronchial margin and abuts the pleural
surface in numerous areas. The inferior edge of the lung has a ratty irregular appearance, An intralobar
fissure is not appreciated grossly, This tumor mass is 2 cm from the closest inferior edge, The remaining
lung has a wet soggy consolidated appearance, Representative sections are submitted, Section surrimary:
Al) bronchial margin from frozen section, A2) vascular margins, A3) section of main bronchus with closest
approach of tumor, A4) tumor and pleural surface, A5-A7) sections of tumor, A8-A9) uninvolved lung,

A. Sections of the Iobectomy show an invasive squamous cell carcinoma predominantly forming
angulated and irregular nests with enlarged nuclei and occasional prominent nucleoli, There is Mild
keratin formation with intercellular bridges and punc;tate necrosis. The tumor is away from the bronchial
and vascular margin but does invade through the visceral pleura where there is dense fibrosis. Tumor is at
the inked outer margin, No diagnostic lymphovascular or perineural invasion is identified, The uninvolved
hung has minimal changes: The sounded focus at the bronchial margin on the frozen section slide is a
rounded aggregate of degenerate hyaline cartilage that has some squamoid features.
B Sections of the additional bronchial margin show benign bronchus and surrounding lung tissue
uninvolved by malignancy.
C, Sections of the pulmonary ligament N9L. specimen show a distorted fragment of lung tissue with a
nested well differentiated neoplastic process at one edge measuring 0.9 cm. The cells are uniformly small
with oval nuclei and even lightly speckled chromatin. No necrosis or mitotic activity is present. The lesion
is at the distorted edge of the tissue.. lmmunohistochemistry shows the lesion is positive for chromogranin
and synaptophysin. The tumor is negative for pancytokeratin.

Peripheral bronchopulmonary, histologically predominantly well differentiated mixed adenocarcinoma of the left lower lobe of the lung. TNM classification on the basis of this material pT2 pN0 R0, stage IB. C34.3 M8255/3.  
Comment/supplementary remark:   
The classification of the adenocarcinoma of the lung is based on the result of the 
immunohistochemical analysis obtained on the previous biopsy material. The tumor has a compact, low stromal structure, of predominantly tubulopapillary differentiation and shows a small bronchioloalveolar component at the margin. It extends to below the pleura, which it has not however infiltrated on the basis of the sample examined. In a central direction the carcinoma has invaded a peripheral b ronchus, this being markedly distended and largely 
obstructed by a tumor plug.  
"," 1. ""Site"": Lung. Justified as the report specifically mentions it's a peripheral bronchopulmonary tumor located in the left lower lobe.
2. ""Laterality"": Left. Justified as the tumor is located in the left lower lobe of the lung.
3. ""Histology"": Mixed adenocarcinoma. Justified as the report states the tumor is a well-differentiated mixed adenocarcinoma.
4. ""Stage"": T2 N0 M0, stage IB. Justified as the tumor has invaded the lung tissue and reached below the pleura, but has not infiltrated it, and no lymph node or distant metastasis is mentioned.
5. ""Grade"": Not provided. The report does not mention the grade of differentiation for this adenocarcinoma.

Gross Description:  
The specimen is received in six parts, all labeled with the patient's name. 
 
Part A is received fresh for frozen section diagnosis additionally labeled  
""mediastinal mass"" and consists of a 5.3 x 2.6 x 0.7 cm portion of yellow -tan 
fatty tissue.   Sectioning reveals a cystic like structure with a granular wall  
that is 3 x 2 x 1 cm and is does not contain any fluid.   The remaining portion  
of tissue has a yellow -tan lobulated smooth and glistening cut surface.  
Residual frozen tissue is  submitted in cassette A1.   Other representative  
sections are submitted in cassettes A2- 3.  
 Part B is received in a single formalin filled container additionally labeled  
""11R"" and consists of a 2.1 x 1.8 x 1.4 cm red- brown irregular portion of soft  
tissue .  The specimen is serially sectioned and submitted entirely in cassettes  
B1-2.  
 Part C is received fresh for collection by the Tissue Bank and.   It 
is additionally labeled ""right upper lobe"" and consists of a previously incised  
lung lobe that is 17 x 7 x  3.5 cm.   There is additionally, another portion of  
lung tissue in the same container that is 7 x 3 x 0.7 cm, which most likely came  
from the area previously incised on the larger portion.   There is an 8.3 x 3.5 x  
3.5 cm white- tan irregular, partially necr otic mass where the previous incision  
has been made. This lesion abuts the pleural surface in this area and is 2 cm  
from the nearest bronchial and vascular margin. The nearest lung parenchymal  
margin is 1.6 cm from the lesion.   Further sectioning of the mass reveals a  
white to yellow -tan, multiloculated, partially hemorrhagic and necrotic mass.  
The mass appears to be involving the pleura, but not penetrating completely  
through the pleura.    
 Representative sections are submitted as follows:  
     C1      br onchial and vascular margins;  
     C2 -3     mass to include overlying pleura;  
     C4 -5     mass to include adjacent lung parenchyma;  
     C6      uninvolved lung parenchyma.  
 Part D is received in a single formalin filled container additionally labeled  
""9R; inferior pulmonary ligament"" and consists of a 1.5 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm portion  
of lymph node with attached fibrous tissue.   The specimen is bisected and  
entirely submitted in cassette D1.  
 
 Part E is received in a single formalin filled container additionally labeled  
""7R"" and consists of multiple portions of irregular nodal tissue admixed with  
fibrous tissue, ranging from 1.5 to 0.4 cm in greatest dimension.   The specimen 
is submitted in toto in cassettes E1- 2.  
 
Part F is received in a single formalin filled container additionally labeled  
""4R"" and consists of two portions of fibrofatty soft tissue that are 4.0 x 1.3 x  
0.5 cm and 2.6 x 1.2 x 0.9 cm.   Multiple lymph nodes are identified, ranging  
from 0.3 to 1.0 cm.    
 Representative sections are submitted as  follows:  
     F1      multiple whole lymph nodes;  
     F2      one lymph node bisected;  
     F3      one lymph node bisected;

Tissue taken at lobectomy. 
MACROSCOPIC 
Two specimens received. 
1: The specimen is labelled ""right upper lobe"" and consists of a right upper lobectomy which measures 
140 x 120 x 50 mm in maximum dimension. Onpalpation there is a firm to hard mass located in the 
apical segment, predominantly on the postsromedial aspect. The mass measures approximately 60 x 65 
x 40 mm in maximum dimension. There is puckering of the overlying pieural surface at the apex. The 
pleural surface on the medial aspect of the specimen has a fibrinous-type exudate. On sectioning there 
is a solid lobulated tumour which has a yellow greyish-white cut surface. It, in places, has a villous­
like architecture. There is haemorrhage scattered throughout the tumour. The tumour appears to abut 
the pleural surface. The tumour appears to lie at least 20 mm from the bronchial resection margin. 
There is a soft tissue resection margin which has a row of staples and measures 85 mm in length. The 
tumour is well clear of this. The surrounding adjacent uninvolved lung parenchyma has a colhipsed 
appearance. [lA, bronchial resection margin; lB-F, tumour; 10, adjacent uninvolved lung 
parenchyma; 1H, hilar lymph nodes]. 
2: The specimen is labelled ""hilar lymph node"" and consists of four irregular greyish-black pieces of 
tissue which measure in aggregate 30 x 20 x 10 mm. [BIT, 2A]. 
MICROSCOPIC 
1: Sections show a well differentiated adenocarcinoma. The tumour has a prominent 
bronchioloalveolar component with a marked papillary pattern. The cells are tall and columnar with 
variable cytoplasm ranging from non-mucinous to clear to mucinous. The lesion is subpleural but 
definite pleural invasion is not identified. There is no blood vessel invasion and no lymphatic 
permeation is seen. No perineural permeation is identified. The lesion is well clear ofthe bronchial 
resection margin. Tumour appears to be present at a diathermied margin, possibly related to pleura in 
block IF. It is difficult to know whether this represents a true margin. No lymph node metastases are 
present. The adj acent lung shows evidence of emphysema . Within the random section of lung, there is 
a localised area of necrosis with surrounding fibrosis. Special stains for microorganisms will be 
performed. 
2: Sections of the lymph nodes show reactive changes only. There is no evidence of malignancy. 
SUMMARY 
Right upper lobe lung and hilar lymph nodes: 
1: Well differentiated adenocarcinoma; 65 mm in maximal dimension. 
2: No blood vessel, lymphatic or perineural invasion present. 
3: No pleural invasion identified; clear of bronchial margin but extends to an area of diathermy (see 
report). 
4: No lymph node metastases. 
5: T2NOMX 
6: Emphysema and necrotic lesion; special stains for microorganisms being performed.

A. The specimen is labeled left upper lobe lung wedge and is received without fixative. It consists of a 
wedge resection of lung which measures 5.2 x 2.5 x 1 cm. A metallic staple line is present along one 
edge. It weighs 9 grams. The pleural surface varies from dark reddish-violet to several foci which have an 
anthracotic appearance. There is a palpable subpleural mass centrally with very slight puckering of the 
pleural surface. On sectioning , this subpleural mass is tan and anthracotic and measures 2 x 1.7 x 1.5 cm. 
It is grossly 0.6 cm from the closest staple line. A representative section of this subpleural mass is 
submitted for frozen section as FS1. The tissue remaining from frozen section is submitted for permanent 
section in cassette A 1. The staple line from the lung wedge is dissected free and the resected edge is 
inked green. Additional representative sectio~he lung wedge, to include all the grossly recognizable 
neoplasm , are submitted in cassettes A2-A4._ 
B. The specimen is labeled left uppe -. ,.e _ - •• ts of a lobe of lung  FINAL SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT 
which weighs 189 grams. It measures 23.5 x 9 x up to 3 cm. The pleural surface of the lung varies from 
pale red to violet to tan in the basilar and most apical portion. There is anthracotic streaking which 
appears linear. Along the middle anterior surface of the lung, there is a 9 cm staple line. The pleural 
surface appears smooth throughout. At the hilum, the bronchial margin is removed as a thin shave and is 
submitted for frozen section as FS2. There is a prominent firm 1.1 cm peribronchial node which is also 
submitted for frozen section as FS3. There are two smaller 0.7-0.8 cm peribronchial nodes. The bronchi 
are dissected and there is no grossly obvious intrabronchial tumor. On sectioning, the metallic staple line 
is 4 cm from the bronchial resection margin. Sections of the pulmonary parenchyma along the staple line 
reveal no grossly obvious tumor. Close serial sectioning of the lung reveal the pulmonary parenchyma at 
the apical portion of the lung to have a honeycomb appearance . Sections of the remainder of the lung 
reveal spongy soft red pulmonary parenchyma without additional masses. Representative sections are 
submitted. Section summary : 81) bronchial margin remaining from frozen section, 82) peribronchial node

Histology: The histology report is not detailed, but based on the procedure described, it may include carcinoma and various benign findings such as anthracosis, fibrosis, and honeycombing.
Stage: Not provided (Staging requires assessment of tumor size, nodal involvement, and metastasis)
Grade: Not provided (Grading requires evaluation of tumor differentiation which is not described in the procedure)
Behavior: Not provided (Malignant behavior is expected in cases with carcinoma, but confirmation requires microscopic examination)

The description suggests that various specimens were removed from the lung and submitted for pathological examination. The findings include removal of a portion of the bronchus, dissection of pulmonary parenchyma along the staple line, and sampling of peribronchial lymph nodes. Some specimens show anthracotic discoloration, which is associated with exposure to coal dust or other environmental pollutants. The procedure also notes a honeycomb appearance in sections of the apical upper lobe, which may suggest interstitial lung disease. However, without microscopic examination and additional clinical information, it is difficult to provide more specific diagnostic information.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

REPORT ON FINDINGS 
Macroscopy 
1.) Inflated, fixed left lung measuring 17 x 14 em at the base and up to 28 em in length, central bronchus 
resection plane located 3 em proximal to the bifurcation of the upper lobe bronchus. At the hilus a 2.3 em 
mobile node with pale brownish-white section surfaces suggestive of a tumor. Pleural fissure obliterated in 
middle third, at the junction of segment 3 with segment the parietal pleura shows an extensive 4 7 x 5.5 em area 
of adhesion. Under this is a centrally soft, but otherwise soft to moderately solid tumor, max. 1.0 em in size, 
pale brownish white at the margin, with a relatively clear and somewhat arcuate demarcation, the main mass 
being in segments 3 and 2 and adjacent sections of the lingula, extending to the pleura in the region of the 
adhesion and involvement of some nodes up to 2.5cm in size, especially at central sites, extending here right up 
to the hilar resection surface. Narrowing of proximal upper lobe segmental bronchi by the tumor. Tumor spread 
to the pleural fissure, lower lobe shows no macroscopic infiltration. Parenchyma in the tumor environment and 
peripherally especially in segment 3 partly diffuse, partly patchy induration and of brownish-yellow color. Rest 
of parenchyma especially in the subpleural region shows slight rarefaction in parts, accentuation of apical 
lesions in segment 1, with lacunae or lacuna systems up to 0.5 em here. In the lower lobe at the branch into the 
bronchi of the basal group two grayish-black nodes up to 0.6 em. 
2.) Pleural tissue from repeat resection: flat or membranous tissue measuring 6.5 x 4 em and up to 0.2 em thick. 
Surface partly smooth, partly rough.

the larger on the section surfaces with 0.3 em hard yellowish area. 
9.) Prevascular and retrotracheal LN (station 3) upper lobe vein: 1.2 em node with some surrounding tissue. 
10.) Hilar LN (station 10) right: 2 em node. 
11.) Paraesophageal LN (station 8) right: two lesioned nodes, 1.6 and I em in size.

EVALUATION 
Primary diagnosis/diagnoses: 
Large, central to peripheral bronchopulmonary, histologically poorly differentiated, large-cell and 
polymorphocellular, nonkeratinizing squamous cell carcinoma of the upper lobe of the left lung. 1NM 
classification according to this picture pT2 pN2 Vl RO, stage MA. C 34.1; M 8070/3; 3. 
Secondary diagnosis/diagnoses: 
Tumor necrosis varying in extent with the formation of a lacuna. Chronic resorptive and organizing pneumonia 
in the tumor environment and S3 periphery. Emphysematous stromal remodeling of lung parenchyma with 
formation of small subpleural cysts in the apex. Suspected respiratory bronchiolitis. Pleural adhesion zones and 
chronic fibrosing parietal pleuritis (sample 2.)). Lymph nodes with reactive follicular hyperplasia in some cases 
(e.g. samples 6.), 8.) and 12.)), in some cases sinus enlargement and an overall rather minor anthracotic pigment 
deposit. 
Remark/addendum: 
The main tumor mass lies in segments 3 and 2. Since the central segmental bronchi are tumor-free, it appears to 
be a primarily peripheral carcinoma of the lung, which has invaded the pleura of the pleural fissure and the 
adhesion zone, although at the latter site the tumor manifestation appears confmed to the visceral layer. Most 
lymph node metastases, some of which are rather large, are found in the hilus region. A micro-metastasis is 
detected in sample. 8.), which explains the nodal classification pN2. "," 1. ""Site"": Left lung. Justified as the report clearly mentions the examination of the left lung and presence of a tumor in it.
2. ""Laterality"": Left. Justified as the report specifically states the location of the tumor in the left lung.
3. ""Histology"": Poorly differentiated, large-cell and polymorphocellular, nonkeratinizing squamous cell carcinoma. Justified as per the pathological diagnosis provided in the report.
4. ""Stage"": The stage is not explicitly provided, but based on the TNM classification given (pT2 pN2 Vl RO), it can be inferred that this is a more advanced stage cancer. However, without all necessary parameters (like M), a definitive stage cannot be determined. So, I would say ""not provided"".

KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS
Referring Physician:
Body Site :Right lower lobe of lung
Specimen Type: Slides
Clinical Data :Adenocarcinoma
RESULTS :Wild-type gene.
INTERPRETATION:
No mutations were identified at codons 12 and 13 of the KRAS gene.
COMMENT:
Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to be associated with poor
prognosis ,and resistance to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor
therapies in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). KRAS mutations occur in 15 -30% of non -small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
patients and are strongly associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking
history.
This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;
based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are
expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of
the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low
percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated for
use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and codon 13 mutations in fresh,
frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue. In particular
the test performance has been established in samples of colorectal
cancer and non-small cell lung carcinoma which harbor these
mutations, although several other tissues are also known to harbor
KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix,
etc.).
Analysis of EGFR mutation or gene amplification status may provide
additional information regarding this patient's probability of
response to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies, if
clinically indicated. See references.
METHOD/LIMITATIONS:
Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is
selected for analysis .DNA is isolated from the sample ,quantified
and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to
exon 2 of the KRAS gene .PCR products are subjected to single
nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;
primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel
electrophoresis and fluorescence detection .False positive or
negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants
or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

ADDENDUM 3:
EGFR Mutation Analysis
Body Site: Right lower lobe of Lung
Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma
RESULTS: Positive for the E746 A750de15 mutation in Exon 19.
INTERPRETATION: Deletion mutations in exon 19, mostly involving the
LREA motif ,are reported to correlate with responsiveness to EGFR
tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies in patients with non -small-cell
lung carcinoma.
COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more cellularity is optimal for
this mutation analysis .The sample submitted showed 50% tumor cellularity upon pathologist review.
E746A750del5 corresponds to 2235_2249de115.
A frequently occurring sequence change 2361 G>A (Q787Q) was
identified .This polymorphism is known not to have clinical
significance.
Mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with
differential responsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase
inhibitor (TKI) therapies. The objective response rate among
patients with a sensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%.
This assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain;
based on the current literature ,most mutations in non-small-cell
lung carcinoma (NSCLC) are expected to occur in these exons.
Mutations present in less than 10-20% of extracted DNA may not be
detected by this method .Mutation status in a sample may change
during tumor progression or the course of the therapy; therefore,
this result cannot be used to infer the presence or absence of a
mutation in another sample or sub -sample obtained from this tumor.
This test is validated for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The
clinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types
is unknown.
METHOD:
Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is
selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the samples, quantified
and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to
exons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by
bi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary gel
electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or
negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants
or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

MACROSCOPIC 
Two specimens submitted. 
I: The first specimen is labelled ""right lower lobectomy"" and consists of a right lower lobectomy 
specimen which measures 70 x 80 x 60 mm. Sectioning reveals a large tumour present predominantly 
in the superior aspect of the lobe which measures 7S x 60 x 60 mm. The tumour has a pink and tan 
colour and has a soft consistency. The tumour reaches the pleura but no definite invasion through the 
pleura is seen grossly. The tumour extensively invades around bronchi and at one point tumour is seen 
to erode through the bronchial wall to form a polypoid mass measuring up to 10 mm within the 
bronchial lumen. This is present approximately 14 mm away from the nearest bronchial resection 
margin. The tumour appears to come within approximately 2 mm of the hilar resection margin but 
tumour is not seen at a surgical resection margin. Located away from the main tumour within the 
inferomedial aspect of the lung are three separate tumour nodules measuring between S to 12 mm in 
diameter. An area of fibrosis and calcification measuring up to 3 mm in diameter is also seen within 
the region of one of the separate tumour nodules in the inferior aspect of the lobe. Lung tissue at the 
superio~ aspect of the lobe proximal to the tumour shows yellow discolouration. The lung in the 
inferior aspect of the lobe distal to the tumour appears fairly unremarkable. [I A, bronchial and hilar 
vascular resection margins; IB, vascular resection margin and lymph nodes; I C-l G, tumour with ID 
being mediastinal resection margin, I E bronchus with invasion by tumour; I G-lI, separate tumour 
deposits inferior to the main tumour; lJ, uninvolved lung proximal to tumour; lK, uninvolved lung 
distal to tumour.] 
2: The second specimen is labelled ""hilar lymph node"" and consists of multiple fragments of grey 
tissue measurin in aggregate approximately 20 x 20 x S mm. [BIT, 2A.] 
MICROSCOPY 
I: Sections show a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. Much of the tumour has the 
cytoarchitectural features of a non-mucinous bronchioloalveolar carcinoma, but unequivocal stromal 
invasion is present, and an endobronchial component is confirmed. Tumour abuts but does not invade 
the pleura, and the bronchial and mediastinal resection margins are clear of malignancy. No vascular 
or lymphatic invasion is identified. Peribronchial lymph nodes show no evidence of metastatic 
adenocarcinoma. Several satellite nodules are confirmed in lung parenchyma inferior to the main 
tumour mass. These show the BAC architecture and presumably represent spread through airways. 
2: Sections show fragments of lymph node in which there is no evidence of metastatic 
adenocarcinoll1 ~\'

Sections of the submitted ""Ungula "" (part E )show an Invasive ,poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma (3.2 cm) which has
an infiltrative and poorly circumscribed border, involving the visceral pleura (PI-2). The tumor invades into but not
through the visceral pleura (biockE7). All surgical resection margins are free of tumor .Of note, multiple Intra-arterial
invasions with tumor cells colonizing the endothelial wall are also seen .A provisional primary tumor staging is provided
as T2a based on the staging information from the 'tingula ""specimen.
Additional sections of the specimen ""pleural deposit"" (part A )show focal small basophilic nests of tumor cells with
some features of neuroendocrine differentiation .Small amount of mature adipose tissue is also present .At deeper
level, some of these areas also showed tubular and acinar architecture ..These tumor cells are positive for TTF-1 and
are negative for syneptophysin and chromogranln ,confirming their malignant nature.

16 x 11 x 3.7 cm.  There is a 5.5 cm staple line near the hilum.  Also 
in the hilar area there is a stapled bronchial stump which measures 6 
mm in diameter when removing staples.  A stapled vessel is also noted 
in the hilum measuring 7 mm in diameter.  These margins appear 
unremarkable.  The pleural surface is smooth and mostly pink and 
glistening with minimal anthracotic pigmentation.  In the superior 
  
anterior portion, however, there is marked puckering and retraction of 
the pleura.  This area is painted black.  On section it corresponds to 
a superficial, fleshy tan dull tumor mass measuring 3.5 x 2.1 x 2.5 cm. 
 A touch preparation is made and a sample is taken for Tissue 
Procurement.  Remaining pulmonary parenchyma is soft pink and spongy. 
Upon exploring the major vessels and bronchi, no lesions are found. 
Rep. sections are submitted following fixation 
Blood account: 1- bronchial and vascular margins esection ; 2 
through 5- tumor; 6 through 7- noninvolved lung.   
 
B.  The specimen is received unfixed labeled ""level II"". It consists of 
a single glistening soft reddish blac dule measuring 0.7 cm in 
greatest dimension.  It is bisected,  
 
C.  Received fresh labeled ""level VII"" is a 1.6 x 1.2 x 0.5 cm soft 
tan-red-gray tissue.  The specimen is quadrasected and entirely 
submitted in one block.

Material examined: 
Left lower lobe 
Clinical diagnosis and question 
Bronchial carcinoma of the left lower lobe. 
REPORT ON FINDINGS 
Macroscopy 
1.) Left lower lobe: inflated, fixed left lower lobe measuring 15 x 10 em at the base, up to 19.5 em high, central 
bronchus resection plane located at the level of bifurcation B6 and the bronchus of the lower group. A staple 
suture line runs from the hilus in a ventral direction for 2.5 em, and a staple snture line runs from the hilus in a 
cranial direction for 3.5 em. Visceral pleura over S6/S!O in the laterodorsal region shows an area of whitish 
thickening and flat protrusion and retraction measuring about 6.5 x 3.5 em. Under this is a fum tumor, max. 5 
em in size, with a vaguely arcuate configuration and central resorption. Peripheral branches ofB6, B9 and BlO 
leading into the tumor. Parenchyma in the tumor margin area partly compacted and pale. Inclusion of vascular 
branches in the tumor. Rest of parenchyma largely inconspicuous. 
2.) Lobar LN (station 12) lingula: 1 em node. 
3.) Lobar LN (station 12) lower lobe: two nodes, 1.2 em and 0.7 em. 
4.) Interlobar LN (station 11) left: 1.5 em node. 
5.) Hilar LN (station 10) left: four nodes between 0.6 em and 1.5 em, partly linked together. 
6.) Pulmonary ligament LN (station 9) left: three nodes between 0.4 em and 0.9 em. 
7 .) Low paratracheal LN (station 4) left: 1.7 em fatty tissue with three nodes between 0.5 em and 1 em. 
8.) Prevascular and retrotracheal LN (station 3) left: three nodes between 0.3 em and 1.2 em with surrounding 
tissue. 
9.) Subcarinal LN (station 7): 1.5 em node 
10.) Paraaortic LN (station 6): 2 em node with surrounding tissue 
11.) Subaortic LN (aortopuhnonary window) (station 5): 1 em node with surrounding tissue 
12.) Hilar LN (station 10) right: two lesioned nodes, 1.5 em and 1 em 
13.) Low paratracheal LN (station 4) right: 1.8 em node with some surrounding tissue. 
Examined: 
1.) a+b: Tumor with pleura and resorption lacuna, c: tumor with peripheral branch ofB9, d: S8 peripheral, e: 
bronchus and vessel resection margins (tangential), 
2.)-13.) All material (in 13.) lamellated) 
17 blocks, partly Elastica-van Gieson, PAS, diastase-PAS 
 Microscopy 
Re 1.): Tumor made up of complexes of destructive growth and longer, partly reticulate structures oflarge 
atypical epithelia in a multilayered arrangement, repeatedly showing vaguely squamous cell layers, with partly 
copious eosinophilic or clear, otherwise stained cytoplasm with inclusion of disorganized, anisomorphic nuclei 
of differing sizes, which also show an enlarged chromatin stmcture. Nucleoli always prominent. Intercellular 
gaps and bridges. Isolated small islands of large tumor cells layered rather like onion skins. Occasionally 
intracellular granular, diastase-digestible, PAS-positive particles and at the same time also small lacunae 
surrounded by tumor cells and containing diastase-resistant, PAS-positive material, with epithelia here at the 
margin also visible in parts as bronchioloalveolar in nature. Between the tumor cell structures smaller areas of 
necrosis with partly degraded granulocytes and other cell debris. Then a lacuna formation with abundant 
necrotic material, here and there remnants of delicate alveolar septa and vessels still visible. Also cholesterol 
crystal gaps and accumulation of various inflammatory cells. Isolated relatively small vessels in the tumor with 
tumor cell nests in the lumen. In parts there is a transfer of tumor cell structures to original respiratory 
epithelium. In the region of cholesterol crystal gaps is an accumulation of large, mostly foamy macrophages 
also within the very confined, nonoxygenated subpleural ( n?) that is still present. In 
some sections, the tumor also extends directly to the pleura, where the pleural elastic fascia is destroyed and 
transcended by a few tumor cell nests. Above this, the pleura is markedly enlarged in parts by connective tissue, 
and in the region of its surface is an accentuated accumulation of inflammatory cells, proliferation of 
mesenchymal spindle cells and capillary vessels and various inflammatory cells and fibrin plaque. Tumor 
growth in a central direction, partially surrounding larger vessels with infiltration and partial destruction of a 
bronchus. Further inflammatory cell infiltrates in the marginal adjacent parenchyma of the lung, where there are 
interstitial follicular lymphocyte aggregates. Small intraalveolar groups of brown pigmented macrophages. 
Otherwise essentially preserved alveolar stroma. Only circumscribed lymphocyte-rich infiltrates in the region of 
the peripheral airways and respiratory bronchioles and alveolar duct. No evidence of tumor at the 'resection 
margins of bronchus and large pulmonary vessels. The stroma of the bronchus shows an increase in elastic 
connective tissue fibers, as well as some chronic inflammatory cells, in part follicularly compressed aud also 
manifest in the region of bronchial glands. A few of them are atrophied. In between or alongside are islets of 
fatty tissue. 
Re 2.) -13.) Some lymph nodes-in particular the larger ones-show an increase in secondary follicles with 
inclusion of large and partly active germinal centers. Small patches of anthracotic pigment deposits, 
accumulation oflarge-cell macrophages, in a few cases also small clusters of epithelioid monocytes. Partial 
enlargement of the sinus, with larger monocytoid cells here in places. 
EVALUATION 
Primary diagnosis/diagnoses: 
Large, peripheral, bronchopulmonary, histologically predominantly large-cell, slightly to moderately 
differentiated, nonkeratinizing squamous cell carcinoma of the left lower lobe of the lung. TNM classification 
according to this picture pT2 pNO (0/23) VI RO. Stage m. C 34.3; M 8070/3. 
Secondary diagnosis/diagnoses: 
Partial necrotic tumor change with formation of a relatively large resorption lacuna. Tumor-associated active 
chronic, partially resorptive inflammation and also locally confined chronic fibrinous, partly already relatively 
high-grade fibrosing pleuritis. Signs suggestive of a slight respiratory bronchiolitis. Chronic bronchitis and 
small foci of fatty tissue metaplasia at the bronchus resection margin. Lymph node with slight anthracotic 
pigment deposits and to some extent marked reactive follicular hyperplasia. 
Remark/addendum: 
To a minimal extent the carcinoma has invaded the overlying visceral pleura, which is markedly fibrosed here. 
In a central direction, the tumor has partially infiltrated and destroyed the bronchi of the basal group, the main 
tumor mass being located in cranial sections of segment 10. Bronchus and vessel resection margins are tumor­
free.

KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS  
 Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma  
 RESULTS: Wild type gene.  INTERPRETATION: No mutations w ere identified at codons 12 and 13 of 
the KRAS gene.  
 COMMENT:  
Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to be associated with poor prognosis, and resistance to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies in patients with non -small- cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  KRAS  
mutations occur in 15-30% of NSCLC patients and are strongly associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking history.  This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene; based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of 
the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated for  
use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and codon 13 mutations in fresh, frozen, or formalin -fixed paraffin embedded tissue. In particular 
the test performance has been established in samples of colorectal  
cancer and non- small cell lung carcinoma which harbor these  
mutations, although several other tissues are also known to harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix, etc.).  
 Analysis of EGFR mutation or gene amplification status may provide additional information regarding this patient's probability of response to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies, if 
 clinically indicated. See references.  
 
METHOD/LIMITATION:  
Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is  
selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified  
and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to  
exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13; primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel  
electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

  EGFR Mutation Analysis  
 
 Referring Physician:  
 Body Site: Right upper lobe of lung  Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma  
 RESULTS: No mutation detected.  
 INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified in the sample provided for analysis. Fewer than 5% of non- small cell lung carcinoma  
patients without identifiable mutations are reported to  be 
responsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies.   COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more tumor cellularity is optimal  
for this mutation analysis. The sample submitted showed 30% tumor cellularity upon pathologist review.  A frequently occurring s equence change 2361G>A (Q787Q) was 
identified. This polymorphism is known not to have clinical significance.  
 Mutations in the tyrosine domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with differential  
responsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapies. The objective response rate among patients with a sensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%.  This assay analyzes exons 18 -21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain; 
based on the current liter ature, most mutations in non- small- cell 
lung carcinoma (NSCLC) are expected to occur in these exons.  
Mutations present in less than 10-20% of extracted DNA may not be detected by this method. Mutation status in a sample may change during tumor progression or the course of therapy; therefore, this result cannot be used to infer the presence or absence of a mutation in another sample or sub-sample obtained from this tumor. 
  
This test is validated for non- small cell lung carcinoma. The  
clinical significance an d utility of this test in other tumor types  
is unknown.  METHOD/LIMITATION:  
Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is  
selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the samples, quantified  
and amplified by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) using primers to  
exons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by bi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary gel  
electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or negative results may occur for reasons that include gene tic variants  
or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

 Fluorescence In -Situ Hybridization (FISH)  
 Specimen
MD 
Body Site: Right upper lobe of lung Specimen Type: Slides  
Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma  
 INTERPRETATION:  
Negative for a rearrangement involving the ALK gene.  
 Probe #Nuclei Examined % Positive Nuclei % Control values 2p23(ALK) 100 0 <15.0 A total of 100 cells were scored.  
 FINDINGS:  
FISH was performed on paraffin embedded tissue sections using the Vysis ALK Break Apart Probe for the ALK gene at 2p23 
When a rearrangement involving ALK is 
present, either inversi on or translocation, one of the two fusion 
signals separates as one red and one green signal. In this  
specimen, separated signals were present in 0% of the nuclei scored.  
This result is within the normal limits.  
 COMMENTS: Three to four copies of ALK were observed in 59.0% of cells. This gain of intact ALK fusion hybridization signals  
represents an aneuploid population with extra copies of chromosome 2/2p ALK region. Additional copies of ALK are not uncommon in NSCLCs, although the significance of extra copies of the ALK gene in  
lung carcinoma is unclear at this time

  The Vysis ALK Break Apart Probe FISH test is FDA  
approved for use in the detection of rearrangements involving the ALK gene via fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in formalin -fixed paraffin -embedded (FFPE) non- small cell lung cancer

removed and submitted as FSG. This is now transferred and submitted in its
entirety for permanent in cassette G1. Examination of the specimen reveals
multiple stapled margins and now removed bronchial margins with bronchi
containing apparent mucus plugging. These staples are removed from both
parenchyma and apparent vascular margins. The stapled parenchymal margin is
removed and the underlying tissue is inked black. The specimen is now
step-sectioned to reveal a well-defined mass that is 3.8 x 1.2 x 2.3 cm. The
mass abuts the pleura and is 0.1 cm from the parenchymal margin at is closest
relationship. It is 3.1 cm from the bronchial margin and 3.5 cm from thenearestvascular margin. Further sectioning through the specimen reveals no additional
masses. Representative sections from the specimen are now submitted as follows: G2 vascular margins;
G3-5 mass to parenchymal margin;

Two specimens received. 
1: The first specimen is labelled ""right middle lobe"" and consists ofa piece of lung measuring 123 x 
100 x 55 mm and weighing 232 g. An amount offat and pericardium is adherent to one surface wbile 
the pleura on the opposite side appears puckered. On sectioning a large tumour mass measuring 
approximately 53 x 45 x 57 mm is seen. This is approximately 11 mID away from the bronchial 
resection margin and extends through most of the specimen. The tumOUT bas a yellow nodular surface 
with a central necrotic area. The tumour is approximately 1 rom away from opposing pleural surfaces 
and 2 mm away from the pleural margin opposite the bronchial resection margin. The tumour extends 
to the area underlying the pericardium and fat and on sectioning appears to invade into the pericardium 
and fat. [Bronchial resection margin, lA; tumour near bronchial resection margin, 18; tumour and

Origin from a bronchus is not identified, and several bronchi within the tumour show no evidence of 
squamous metaplasia or dysplasia. The bronchial resection margin is clear of malignancy and shows 
no evidence of squamous metaplasia or dysplasia. Tumour is confumed to invade into the pericardium 
but does not extend through to the inner mesothelial -lined surface and is clear of the adjacent soft tissue 
resection margins. There is no evidence of pleural invasion on the opposite aspect of the specimen to 
the adherent pericardium. VRscutar, lymphatic and perineural invasion is present. Distant lung

Right upper lobe of lung,Right,Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma,T2N2MX,,Malignant,TCGA-78-7536.pdf,"RIGHT UPPER LOBE 
Clinical Details: 
RUL tumour. 
Three specimens received: 
1: RIGHT UPPER LOBE 
Macroscopy: 
The specimen is labelled ""right upper lobe"" and consists of a lobectomy measuring 145 x 120 x 60 mm 
in the inflated state. It is closed by a triradiate staple line. On the lateral aspect of the lung there are 
multiple fatty adhesions. In the posterior segment there appears to be a hard subpleural mass 
measuring approximately 53 mm in diameter. Adjacent to the bronchial resection margin there is a 
hard lymph node mass measuring 32 x 30 mm. On sectioning these lymph nodes have a white, yellow 
and black mottled appearance. On sectioning the mass measures 48 mm in diameter and it has a firm 
sclerotic appearance. There are possibly lymph node metastases adjacent to this apart from those 
adjacent to the bronchial resection margin. The surrounding lung is severely emphysematous with 
bulla formation. The lesion is subpleural but extends probably within 12 mm of the bronchial resection 
margin. Areas of necrosis are present within the tumour. Distal to the tumour there is evidence of 
obstructive pneumonitis. [Bronchial resection margin-I A; nodal mass adjacent to the bronchial 
resection margin 1 B-1 C; other peribronchial lymph nodes-I D; tumour and pleura IE-IF; tumour and 
adjacent pneumonitis-I G; inferior tumour mass with adjacent lymph nodes, uninvolved lung tissue-lI.] 
Microscopy: 
Sections show a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. The lesion is subpleural and there appears to be 
focal invasion into but not through the pleura. Fibrofatty adhesions are present on the surface. No 
blood vessel or perineural invasion is seen but there appears to be focal lymphatic permeation. Several 
peribronchial lymph nodes are involved by metastatic carcinoma. The tumour appears clear of the 
bronchial resection margin and there is no definite involvement of the soft tissue resection margin 
adjacent to the peribronchial lymph nodes. The adjacent lung shows severe centriacinar emphysema 
with bulla formation and distal to the tumour there is evidence of obstructive pneumonitis. 
2: NO.7 LYMPH NODE 
Macroscopy: 
The specimen is labelled ''No.7'' and consists of a nodal mass measuring 40 x 27 x 20 mm. On 
sectioning there are firm white masses present within the blackened lymph node parenc 
Microscopy: 
There is extensive replacement of the lymph node by metastatic poorly differentiated carcinoma. 
3: NO. 4R LYMPH NODE 
Macroscopy: 
The specimen is labelled ""No. 4R"" and consists of a piece of 
mm. On sectioning the lymph node contains firm pale nodules. 
Microscopy: measuring 25 x 20 x 14 
Sections show extensive replacement of the lymph node by metastatic poorly differentiated carcinoma. 
Summary: 
Right upper lobe of lung and peribronchial and mediastinal lymph nodes: 
1: Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma; 48 mm in maximal dimension. 
2: No blood vessel or perineural invasion present but lymphatic permeation identified .

    consists of a single stapled wedge biopsy of lung measuring 9.5 x  
    6.5 x 5 cm in greatest dimensions.  The pleural surface is inked 
and 
    the specimen is serially sectioned.  On cut section there is a 3.2

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION  
    cellular crowding with nuclear overlap and focal

    supportive of a well differentiated adenocarcinoma.  The rather  
    compact architecture in some areas and fibrosis is suggestive of an  
    invasive process.  It is difficult to assess for visceral pleural  
    invasion, and although there is a suspicious area (block 6), I 
would 
    recommend to assess with an elastic stain.

Lung,,Mixed bronchopulmonary adenocarcinoma with an acinar and papillary component and partly bronchioloalveolar growth pattern,pT2 pNX pMX RX,,Malignant,TCGA-05-4384.pdf," 
: 
Lung resection material with peripheral manifestation of  an evidently mucin -forming 
adenocarcinoma (sample 1) with a tubulopapillary structure and partly a bronchioloalveolar 
growth pattern,.  
Comment:  
According to conventional histology, this is a peripheral mixed bronchopulmonary 
adenocarcinoma with an acinar and papillary component and partly bronchioloalveolar growth pattern (immunohistological analysis and confirmation to follow), which has focally infiltrated the visceral pleura in the region of the pleural adhesion zone. The tumor extends as far as the basal row of metal clamps. Subject to the immune profile, the TNM classification on the basis of this material is thus pT2 pNX pMX RX (C34.3, M8255/3).  
1st follow- up report:  
The immu ne profile (positivity doe cytokeratin 7 and TTF1, focally also for cytokeratin 20 
and also negativity for CDX2) confirms the bronchopulmonary adenocarcinoma. 
  
"," 1. ""Site"": Lung. Justified as the report specifically mentions this is a lung resection material and the TNM code indicates it's a lung cancer (C34.3).
2. ""Laterality"": Not provided. The report does not specify whether the tumor is located on the left or right lung.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: 
sections from the lung show an infiltrating halfway differentiated 
squamous cell carcinoma. The tumor infiltrates a segmental bronchus, 
has penetrated it and ulcerated the mucosa. It is compressing the 
segmental artery which is not infiltrated by the tUmor. There are 5 
para-arterial lymph nodes, one of which shows metastatic tumor. The 
lung adjacent to the tumor shows interstitial follicular pneumonia and 
early acute supporative pneumonia. The pleura is thick and hemorrahgic 
and abutted, but not infiltrated by the tumor.

REPORT ON FINDINGS 
Macroscopy 
1.) Inflated, flxed resected lower lobe measuring 18 x 13.5 em at the base and up to 15 em high, central 
bronchus resection plane located distal to the bifurcation of B6. In the perihilar region some staple suture lines 
up to 4 em long. At the hilus is a 1 em lesioned grayish-black node. Pleura especially in the lateral and dorsal 
regions and -less markedly- in the basal region shows a vaguely pavement-like relief appearance. In segment 
8 a moderately flrm, pale brownish tumor, max. 5.4 em in size, mostly with a relatively clear and slightly 
arcuate demarcation, extending to within 0.3 em of the ventral pleura. Truncation of some subsegmental 
branches of B8 in the tumor. Questionable involvement by the tumor of at least one grayish-black pigmented 
node. Rest of the parenchyma shows diffuse induration and a pale color, in sections reticulate or streaky whitish 
pattern. In the lateral subpleural region at the junction of segments 9/10 is a disk-shaped blackish node 0.5 em 
in size. 
2.) Parietal pleura: plate-like, predominantly whitish tissue measuring 2.1 x 1.5 em and up to 0.4 em thick with 
partly shiny and partly slightly tubercular surface. 
3.) Lobar LN (station 12) middle lobe: 2 em lesioned node or node part. 
4.) Interlobar LN (station 11) right: three grayish-black node parts between 0.2 and 0.5 em. 
5.) Hilar LN (station 10) right: 1.2 em lesioned node or node part with sparse surrounding tissue. 
6.) Paraesophageal LN (station 8) right: 0.5 em node with some surrounding tissue. 
7.) Subcarinal LN (station 7): 1.8 em lesioned grayish-black node part with some surrounding tissue. 
8.) Low paratracheal LN (station 4): two lesioned grayish-black nodes or node parts, 1 and 1.2 em in size. 
9.) Hilar LN (station 10) left: 1.1 em lesioned node or node part with some surrounding tissue. 
Examined: 
1.) Tumor with remaining parenchyma + pleura, with questionable involvement of nodes, with bronchial 
branch, S6 + S 10 dorsal, subpleural node (halved), central bronchus resection plane and resection margins of 
vessels, hilar nodes, 
2.)-9.) All material (in 2. preparation lamellated, in 3., 5., 7.-9. nodes halved in each case),

 EVALUATION 
Primary diagnosis/diagnoses: 
From intetmediate to peripheral bronchopulmonary, histologically poorly differentiated, large-cell, focally 
keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma of the right lower lobe of the lung located in S8. 
TNM classification according to this picture pT2 pNO pMX VI RO, stage IB. 
C34.3 M8070/3. 
Secondary diagnosis/diagnoses: 
Focal, temporarily heterogeneous, chronic fibrosing interstitial pneumonia manifest in the mantle zone with 
fibrous and focally small honeycomb-like parenchyma remodeling and also focal bronchiolization detected in 
S6 (sample 1.)). Intrapulmonary, parabronchial and hilar lymph node of the main preparation and the lymph 
nodes of samples 3.) -9.) with uncharacteristic reactive lesions aud anthracotic pigment deposits. Hypocellular 
fibrosis zone of parietal pleura (sample 2.)). 
Remark/addendum: 
The carcinoma has invaded small to medium-sized blood vessels in the tumor. The visceral pleura, the resection 
plane of the bronchi and vessels and all lymph nodes identified and excised are tumor-free. 
No asbestos bodies are found in the prepared section planes, but much further-reaching investigations, 
especially dust analyses, are needed to determine the asbestos exposure of the lung. "," 1. Site: Right lower lobe. Justified as the report clearly mentions the tumor is located in the right lower lobe.
2. Laterality: Right. As the site is the right lower lobe, it's inherently a right-side location.
3. Histology: Large-cell, focally keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma. As mentioned in the primary diagnosis.
4. Stage: T2 pNO pMX VI RO, stage IB. This is the TNM classification provided for this case.
5. Grade: Not provided. The report mentions histological poor differentiation but does not provide a specific grade.
6. Behavior: Malignant. Implied as it's a cancer (carcinoma) and the report states that the carcinoma has invaded small to medium-sized blood vessels in the tumor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HISTORY 
NSCC LLL with? Nl metastases. 
MACROSCOPIC 
Four specimens received: 
1: The first specimen is labelled ""left lung"" and consists of a left pneumonectomy specimen which 
measures 180 x 150 x 40 mm. Located in the apex of the left lower lobe is a large peripheral tumour 
measuring 70 x 65 x 45 mm. There is some puckering of the overlying pleura above the tumour but 
definite invasion to the pleura cannot be identified grossly. Many enlarged hilar lymph nodes and 
intraparenchymallymph nodes are identified but none of these show macroscopic evidence of tumour 
involvement. Elsewhere the visceral pleura and parenchyma show prominent carbon pigmentation. 
The visceral pleura at the apex of the left upper lobe shows a cream papule. No other lesions are 
identified grossly. [1 A, bronchial and pulmonary artery hilar resection margin; 1 B-1 C, bronchial 
lymph node; ID, interlobar lymph node; lE-lG, tumour with overlying pleura; IH-lJ, 
intraparenchymallymph nodes from left lower lobe; lK, intraparenchymallymph nodes from left 
upper lobe; lL, lung away from tumour in left lower lobe; 1M, lung from left upper lobe; IN, further 
section of tumour and adjacent uninvolved parenchyma.] 
2: The second specimen is labelled ""hilar lymph node No.1"" and consists of a lymph node measuring 
6 mm in diameter. [BIT, 2A.] 
3: The third specimen is labelled ""No.2 hilar lymph node"" and consists of two fragments of nodal 
tissue, the largest measuring approximately 12 mm in diameter. [Bisected, blocked with smaller 
fragment,3A.] 
4: The fourth specimen is labelled ""lymph node No.8"" and consists of two fragments of nodal tissue, 
the largest measuring approximately 1 0 mm in diameter. The other fragment appears to contain 
multiple nodes on sectioning. [Each fragment bisected, BIT, 4A-4B.] 
MICROSCOPY 
1: Sections show a moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma which abuts but does not 
invade the pleura. There are extensive areas of tumour necrosis and several blood vessels within the 
tumour are obliterated but definite vascular invasion is not found. No lymphatic or perineural 
infiltration is seen. Peribronchial lymph nodes show reactive hyperplasia, anthracosis and a few small 
silicotic nodules but defmite tumour metastases are not found. However metastatic carcinoma is 
present within intraparenchymallymph nodes from the left lower lobe (lJ). A single fragment sampled 
as a peribronchial lymph node appears to represent a fragment of the primary tumour (lD). Lung 
parenchyma away from the tumour shows a marked degree of peribronchial and interlobular septal 
anthracosis. There is also upper lobe emphysema and pleural fibrosis. 
2: Sections show a small lymph node in which there is no evidence of malignancy. 
3: Sections show partial replacement of the lymph node by metastatic adenocarcinoma. 
4: Sections show reactive lymph nodes with anthracosis and occasional silicotic nodules. There is no 
evidence of metastatic carcinoma. 
SUMMARY 
Left pneumonectomy and lymph node sampling : 
Moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, 70 mm in diameter. 
No pleural, vascular or perineural infiltration seen. 
Metastases in intraparenchymal and hilar lymph nodes. 
Pathological stage T2 Nl.

The sample consists of a fragment of soft tissue measuring 3.5 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm. Microscopic examination reveals features consistent with a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST), WHO Grade III. No specific sites of origin are identified, but the lesion is abutting and possibly arising from a nerve bundle. There is no evidence of residual schwannoma or neurofibroma within this sample. The specimen shows focal areas of tumor necrosis. Mitotic activity is brisk (>10 mitoses/10 high power fields). Surgical margins are widely involved by the tumor. No lymphovascular invasion is identified.

1. ""Site"": not provided, as the report does not specify a clear site of origin for the tumor.
2. ""Laterality"": not provided, as the report does not mention whether the tumor is on the left or right side.
3. ""Histology"": malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST), as stated in the report. (""The lesion is abutting and possibly arising from a nerve bundle and shows features consistent with a MPNST, WHO Grade III."")

D
iagnosis:  
1. Atypical resection material from the indicated upper lobe of the lung with an infiltrate of poorly differentiated and non-mucigenous, pulmonary adenocarcinoma, of max. 3.2 cm in size. 
 Tumor classification:  
M-8140/3, G 3, pT 2, pV 1, pN 2, pM x, stage III A. R0.   Immunohistological follow -up report 
In the region of the tumor cells there is an absence of cytokeratin 5 expression. Some of the tumor cells co -express cytokeratin 7 and 20 and most show nuclear expression of TTF-1. 
There is also marked CEA expression. The proliferation marker Mib- 1 (61-67) moderately 
high with staining of about 30% of tumor cell nuclei.  Assessment:  
The marker spectrum especially with the diffuse and marked nuclear expression of TTF-1 supports the diagnosis of primary pulmonary adenocarcinoma.  
  
"," 1. ""Site"": Lung. Justified by the diagnosis mentioning atypical resection material from the lung.
2. ""Laterality"": Not provided. The report does not specify if the left or right lung is affected.
3. ""Histology"": Adenocarcinoma, as stated in the diagnosis and supported by the tumor classification (M-8140/3).
4. ""Stage"": IIIA (T2N2Mx). The tumor invaded the pulmonary pleura (pT2), there are metastases in 4-6 lymph nodes (pN2) and no distant metastasis (pMx). This corresponds to stage IIIA.
5. ""Grade"": III. The grade is not explicitly stated, but the tumor is described as poorly differentiated (G3), which would correspond to Grade III.
6. ""Behavior"": Malignant. This is inherent in the diagnosis of cancer; the report also mentions invasion of the pulmonary pleura and lymph node metastases.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CLINICAL HISTORY AND PRE - OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  
ex-smoker (20 pack -years), now with a 2.6 cm LUL nodule.  
 
MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:  
The specimen is received in eight parts, each labeled with the  
patient's name.  
 
1. Part  one is received fresh, labeled 'left upper lobe nodule r/o  
carcinoma'. It consists of a wedge biopsy of the lung measuring 10  
x 5 x 2.5 cm. The specimen is received previously incised. Also  
noted two stapled lines measuring 10 cm and 3.5 cm. The stapled l ine 
is shaved and the pleura around the staple is inked black. Also  
noted on pleura is focal puckering and fibrotic area. Cutting into  
the specimen reveals a grey -white firm nodule measuring 1.5 x 1.5 x  
1 cm. The nodule located is 1.5 cm and 1 cm from both stapled lines.  
Frozen section performed on the nodule and resubmitted for permanent  
section. The remainder of the parenchyma is pink -red blotchy and  
crepitant. Representative sections are submitted.  
 
2. Part two is received in saline, labeled 'station 8 lymph node'.  
It consists of two pieces of tan and black soft tissue measuring 1.0  
x 0.5 x 0.4 cm and 0.6 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm. The specimen is submitted 
entirely in one cassette.

0.2 cm. The specimen is submitted entirely in one cassette.  
 
5. Part five is received fresh, labeled 'left upper lobectomy'. It  
 consists of a 174 gram upper lobe of the left lung measuring 18 x 8  
x 3.7 cm. Along the pleural surface of the lung, is a row of  
surgi cal staples extending from the anterior medial apex, obliquely  
along the anterior lateral pleura for a length of 13.5 cm. The 
visceral pleura is smooth, reddish purple from subpleural hemorrhage  
and outlined by black lymphatics. The area surrounding the st aples  
on the anterior surface is inked in green, and the staples are  
removed revealing dark -red lung parenchyma with a homogeneous cut  
surface. The lung is serially sectioned and no lesions are grossly  
seen or palpated. Representative sections are submitted in seven  
cassettes.  
 6. Part six is received in saline, labeled 'station 6 lymph node'.

  ADDENDUM # 2 FOR MOLECULAR TESTS:  
 
KRAS and EGFR were sent on or patient  
The test is to be performed on tissue from case  
The case report, slides, and blocks for the cited  
accession number were retrieved from archives. The pathologist whose  
signature appears below reviewed the original pathology report,  
examined candidate H&E slides, and selected block 1D appropriate to  
the specifications of the ordered molecular analysis. x1 H&E and x9  
unstained slides were prepared and forwarded to  where the  
subject molecular test will be performed. An addendum report will be  
issued when the results of this molecular test are available.  
 
  Addendum #1 performed by  
 
    
ADDENDUM 2:  
  
 
 
RESULTS: Positive for a p.G12A (c.35G>T) mutation in codon 12 of  
the KRAS gene.  
 
INTERPRETATION: Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to  
correlate with poor prognosis and resistance to tyrosine kinase 
inhibitor therapies in patients with non- small lung cancer.  
 COMMENT:  
KRAS mutations occur in 15- 30% of non- small- cell lung cancer (NSCLC)  
patients and are strongly associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking history.  
 This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;  
based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are  
expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of  
the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low  
percentage of cells may not be detected.  
 
This test is validated for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and  
codon 13 mutations in fresh, frozen, or formalin- fixed paraffin 
embedded tissue. In particular the test performance has been  
established in samples of colorectal cancer and non- small cell lung  
carcinoma which harbor these mutations, although several other  
tissues are also known to harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of  
pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix, etc.).  
 
METHOD/L IMITATION: 
 
Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is  
selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified  
and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to 
exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single  
nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;  
primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel  
electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or  
negative results may occur for reasons that inc lude genetic variants  
or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

EGFR Mutation Analysis  
 
Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma  
 RESULTS: No mutation detected  
 INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified; however 18- 20% of  
patients with non- small- cell lung cancer and without identifiable  
mutations are reported to be responsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase  
inhibitor therapies.  
 
  
COMMENT: This assay analyzes exons 18- 21 of the EGFR tyrosine  
kinase domain; based on the current literature, the vast majority of  
mutations are expected to occur in these exons. The analytical  
sensitivity of the assay is 10- 20%, thus mutations present in a low  
percentage of cells may not be detected.  
 Most data published to date pertain to gefitinib (Iressa(r)).  
Similar da ta have been seen in studies using erlotinib (Tarceva(r)).  
 Homozygosity for the frequently occurring sequence change 2361 G>A  
was identified. The polymorphism is not likely to have clinical  
significance.  
 This test is validated for non- small cell lung carcinoma. The 
clinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types  
is unknown.  
 
METHOD:  
Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is  
selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the samples, quantified  
and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to 
exons 18- 21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by  
bi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary gel  
electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or  
negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants  
or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

ain diagnosis/diagnoses:  
Pulmonary wedge resection material with peripheral manifestation of a focally mucin -forming 
adenocarcinoma (sample 1.)) showing a predominantly tubular or acinar structure, in parts a 
bronchioloalveolar growth pattern and a small solid and papillary component.  
Comment/supplementary remark:   
According to the conventional histology, the findings are consistent with a peripheral mixed 
bronchopulmonary adenocarcinoma (C 34.1, M 8255/3), the TNM classification of which on the basis of these samples is pT2 pN0 pMX L1 V1 RX, corresponding to stage IB. (Immunohistological analysis as to the tumor’s point origin will follow.) The tumor shows foci of infiltration in the visceral pleura and extends to the basal resection margin, which gives rise to RX classification from the patho -anatomical viewpoint.  
 The immune profile (positive for cytokeratin 7 and TTF-1, negative for cytokeratin 20 and CDX-2) confirms the bronchopulmonary origin of the tumor.  
"," 1. ""Site"": Lung. Justification: The report clearly states that this is a pulmonary wedge resection and the subsequent discussion refers to the lung as the location of the tumor.

  MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY  
 KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS  
 
 
 RESULTS: Wild -type gene  
 
 INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified at codons 12 and 13 
of the KRAS gene.  COMMENT:  
Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to be associated with  poor 
prognosis, and resistance to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies in patients with non -small- cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  
 KRAS mutations occur in 15-30% of NSCLC patients and are strongly associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking history.  This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene; 
based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated  
for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and codon 13 mutations in fresh, frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue. In particular the test performance has been established in samples of colorectal cancer and non -small cell lung carcinoma which harbor  
these mutations, although several other tissues are also known to harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix, etc.).  Analysis of EGFR mutation or gene ampl ification status may provide  
additional information regarding this patient's probability of response to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies, if clinically indicated. See references.  
 METHOD/LIMITATIONS:  
Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologis t and relevant tumor is  
selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified  
and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13; primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel  
electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

  INTEGRATED ONCOLOGY  
  EGFR Mutation Analysis  
 
 
 
 Body Site: Left lower lobe of lung  
 
Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma  
 RESULTS: Positive for the E746_A750del5 mutation in Exon 19.  
 INTERPRETATION: Deletion mutations in exon 19, mostly involving the  
LREA motif, are reported to correlate with responsiveness to EGFR  
tyrosine kinase inhibitor in patients with non- small- cell lung  
carcinoma.  
  COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more tumor ce llularity is optimal  
for this mutation analysis. The sample submitted showed 80% tumor  
cellularity upon pathologist review.  
 E746_A750del5 corresponds to 2236_2250del15.  A frequently occurring sequence change 2361G>A (Q787Q) was  
identified. This polymorphism is known not to have clinical  
significance.  
 Mutations in the tyrosine domain of the epidermal growth factor  
receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with differential  
responsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)  
therapies. The objective response rate among patients with a  
sensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%.  
 This assay analyzes exons 18 -21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain;  
based on the current literature, most mutations in non- small- cell 
lung carcinoma (NSCLC ) are expected to occur in these exons.  
Mutations present in less than 10- 20% of extracted DNA may not be  
detected by this method. Mutation status in a sample may change  
during tumor progression or the course of therapy; therefore, this  
result cannot be us ed to infer the presence or absence of a mutation  
in another sample or sub- sample obtained from this tumor. 
 This test is validated for non- small cell lung carcinoma. The  
clinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types  
is unknown.  METH OD/LIMITATION:  
Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is  
selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the samples, quantified  
and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to exons 18- 21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by   bi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary gel  
electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or 
negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

"," Site: Left lower lobe of lung
Laterality: Not provided
Histology: Adenocarcinoma
Stage: Not provided
Grade: Not provided
Behavior: Malignant (as inferred from the context of molecular testing for cancer)

Justification for the choice: The report includes an addendum for KRAS mutation analysis, which is commonly associated with adenocarcinoma in lung cancer. Additionally, there is a separate addendum for EGFR mutation analysis, and the sample is positive for a deletion mutation in exon 19, which is reported to correlate with responsiveness to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy in patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma. Therefore, it can be inferred that the site information refers to the left lower lobe of the lung, and the histology is adenocarcinoma.

Clinical Details: 
Left pneumonectomy for bronchogenic carcinoma. 
Two specimens received: 
I: LEFT LUNG 
Macroscopy: 
The upper lobe measures 160 x 110 x 35 mm in an infused state and displays an apical scar. The 
lingular appears collapsed. Centriacinar emphysema is apparent on sectioning the upper lobe. Distal 
airways contain mucus. The lower lobe measures 160 x 120 x 60 mm an in infused state. There is a 
large tumour involving the lateral basal segment of the inferior lobe, measuring 55 x 38 x 25 mm in 
maximum dimension. The tumour abuts the pleura and the pleura is slightly irregular over its surface. 
Lymph nodes at the hilum of the lower lobe are obviously involved by metastatic tumour. No 
endobronchial tumour is identified. Tumour extends to within 45 mm of bronchial resection margin. 
On sectioning, the tumour is solid and cream in colour and displays a central area of necrosis. It has a 
well circumscribed margin. The uninvolved lung parenchyma displays mild centriacinar emphysema.

Molecular AnatomiC Pathology testing: 
A. KRAS Exon 1 mutation IS IDENTIFIED (Gly12Cys). 
B. EGFR Exon 19 mutation NOT Identified. 
C. EGFR Exon 21 mutation NOT identified. 
Note: 
KRAS codon 12113 mutations are found In approximately 10-30% lung adenocarcinomas and associated with history of 
smoking (1). EGFR exon 19 and 21 mutations are present in about 10% of non-Asians and up to 40% In the Asian 
population. common in non-smokers and associated with the tumor response to treatment with EGFR inhibitors (2). 
These mutations are mutually exclusive and their presence may have prognostic and/or therapeutic implications (3,4). 
~/e Preparation and Gene Sequencina Analvsis 
For cytology samples, extractJon of DNA was performed from the fluid or sample provided. For surgical specimens, tumor microdissection was 
perform$d DNA was /,soleted using standard laboratory procedure. Optical density readings were obtained. For tile detection of mutatron, DNA 
was amplified with primers fla.1k,ing exon 1 in the KRAS gene and exons 19 snd 21 of the EGFR gene. Then, forward and reverse sequencing was 
performed USing the BigDye Terminator Kit on ABI3130 (Applied Biosystems). The known hotspots were analyzed for the presence of mutations 
With Mutation Surveyor V3.01 (SoftGenetics). 
Addendum 
PROBE: Vysis LSI EGFR SDectrumOrangel CEP 7 SpectrumGreen ™ Probe 
Fluorescence in-situ hybridization studies performed On the adenocarcinoma centromere of 
chromosome 7 of 1.2 indicating no EGFR amplification in the targeted region. The rate of hyperploidy for the centromere of 
chromosome 7 was 26% of the analyzed celis. The signal to nucleus ratio (SNR) for the EGFR gene was 2.5. 
Interpretation guidelines for EGFR Gene Copy Number by FISH: 
Ratio of EGFR to the centromere of chromosome 7: 
Less than 2.0: No EGFR amplification 
Greater than 2.0: EGFR amplification 
Hyperploidy: Greater than two centromere copies/cell. 
SNR: The average number of EGFR signals per analyzed ceil within the targeted region. 
Clinical stUdies show high EGFR gene copy number by FISH analysis to be associaled with favorable clinical benefit (clinical

DIAGNOSIS 
A. Lung, left upper lobe, excisional biopsy: 
Well to moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. 
"," 1. ""Site"": Lung. Justification: The report clearly states the specimen is from the left upper lobe of the lung.
2. ""Laterality"": Left. Justification: The report mentions ""left upper lobe"" confirming the laterality.
3. ""Histology"": Adenocarcinoma. Justification: The frozen section diagnosis and final diagnosis both confirm the histology as adenocarcinoma.
4. ""Stage"": T1 N0, based on the TNM stage mentioned in the microscopic description (T1: tumor size 1.5 em, NO: no regional lymph node metastasis).
5. ""Grade"": Well to moderately differentiated (Grade I-II). Justification: The report mentions ""Well to moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma"" in the final diagnosis.
6. ""Behavior"": Malignant. Justification: This is inherent in the diagnosis of cancer; malignancy implies the ability of the tumor to invade surrounding tissues and potentially spread to other parts of the body.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"" ""'~~~ MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
A. Nine slides are examined. The bronchial margin appears on cassette 1 and 
does not show any evidence of involvement by tumor. Portions of vascular 
'; margin appear on cassette 2 without evidence of tumor involvement. Three 
hilar lymph nodes are present 6n slide 3. All of them show extensive 
replacement by non-oat cell carcinoma. Portions of lung mass are seen on 
slides 4 through 7. The tumor demonstrates extensive necrosis on slide 4. and 
the remaining pattern is that of a moderately to poorly differentiated 
carcinoma with numerous areas showing clear cells along with typical malignant 
glands. There is extensive intrapulmonary lymphatic and vascular invasion. 
Pleural lymphatics on slide 4 are filled with plugs of tumor and both veins 
and lymphatics of the interlobular septum show tumor involvement on the same 
slide. Ex ensive involvement of the vis eral leura is also oted on slide

I have personally reviewed all specimens and or slides ,including the
listed special stains ,and used them with my medical judgement to
determine the final diagnosis.
CLINICAL HISTORY:
The patient is a year-old man with a history of right lung cancer who
undergoes lobectomy with lymph node staging and immediate frozen section
diagnosis.
GROSS:
Nine specimens are received ,each labeled with the patient 's name and
hospital identification number.
A. Specimen A is designated ""lymph node, station 7."" The specimen consists of a 2.1 x 1.2 x 0.5 cm red-tan tissue fragment. The
specimen is submitted in cassette A for frozen section diagnosis.
B. Specimen B is designated ""lymph node, station 7."" The
specimen consists of a 2.0 x 1.8 x 0.8 cm aggregate of friable, tan-red
and irregularly-shaped soft tissue fragments. All fragments are
submitted in two cassettes.
C. Specimen C is designated ""lymph node, 10 R."" The specimen
consists of a 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm segment of adipose tissue. The
specimen is submitted in cassette C for frozen section diagnosis.
D. Specimen D is designated ""lymph node, 12 R #2."" The
specimen consists of a red/black tissue fragment measuring 0.8 x 0.5 x
0.4 cm and 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.1 cm. Both fragments are submitted in cassette
D for frozen section diagnosis.
E. Specimen E is designated ""lymph node station 10 R."" The
specimen consists of a 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm tan-red soft tissue fragment.
The specimen is submitted in cassette E.
F. Specimen F is designated ""lymph node, 10 R #3."" The
specimen consists of a 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.3 cm tan-gray aggregate of soft
tissue. All fragments are submitted in cassette F for frozen section
diagnosis. G. Specimen G is designated ""lung, right upper lobe bronchial
margin."" The specimen consists of a 263 gm right lower lobectomy
measuring 14.3 x 10.2 x 6.0 cm. The pleural surface is remarkable for a
underlying mass adjacent to the bronchus. The bronchial margin is
removed and submitted enface for frozen section diagnosis. The
remainder of the pleural surface is inked blue. The specimen is
sectioned revealing an exophytic, tan-white, solid-appearing lesion
measuring 5.0 x 4.9 x 3.9 cm. The lesion is adjacent to the hilum and
0.1 cm from the bronchial margin. This lesion appears to abut the
serosal surface, where no serosal extension is noted. Sectioning the
remainder of the lung parenchyma has a consolidated, tan-red appearance
with areas of mucus plugging. No additional mass or lesions are
present. Representative tissue was procured for potential future
studies. The specimen is sampled in 14 cassettes.
Summary of Cassettes:
G1- bronchial margin, en face (frozen section).
G2 - three potential lymph nodes.
G3 - single lymph node bisected.
G4 - vascular margin.
G5-G7 - tumor closest to dominant airway.
G8-G11 - additional tumor with adjacent soft tissue.
G12-G14 - uninvolved lung parenchyma. H. Specimen H is designated ""lymph node station 4 R."" The
specimen consists of three tan-red, spongy-appearing tissue fragments
ranging in size from 2.0 to 0.8 cm in greatest dimension. All fragments
are submitted intact in two cassettes.
1. Specimen I is designated ""lung wedge biopsy, right middle
lower lobe wedge."" The specimen consists of a thin, tan-red wedge
excision measuring 4.0 x 0.8 x 0.3 cm. The polar surface is submitted
intact. The staple line is identified and removed and the new
parenchymal margin is inked blue. The specimen is sectioned revealing a
spongy, red, unremarkable cut surface. The specimen is entirely
submitted in two cassettes.
Summary of Cassettes:
11-12 - right middle lower lobe wedge, entirely submitted.

Microscopic Description:
Sections of specimen #2 show a large cell malignant neoplasm that in
areas shows prominent gland formation. These glandular area blend
into more solid nests of neoplastic cells. These are supported by a
dense fibrous stroma and alternate with areas of necrosis. The
neoplasm extends into the pleural but not onto the pleural surface.
Sections of the neoplasm within the right upper lobe specimen #3
show a large cell malignant neoplasm with a distinctly different
growth pattern. In this neoplasm the cells form sheets that have
irregular borders. The cells have a moderate amount of eosinophilic
cytoplasm and enlarged pleomorphic nuclei.
Sections of the lymph node specimens show no areas of metastatic
carcinoma.
lmmunohistochemical stains are performed on the neoplasm in the
right lower lobe specimen and right upper lobe specimen. The right lower lobe specimen shows the neoplasm to be positive for CK7 andnegative for CK20 .Some of the cells are strongly positive for
TTF1. These are in the more glandular areas .The more solid areasare negative for this marker .The more solid areas do express
positivity for CDX -2 where the glandular areas tend to be negative
for this marker .The cells are negative for p63 .This staining
pattern would support this being an adenocarcinoma of pulmonary
origin .It is unclear why some of the cells mark with the
colorectal marker CDX-2. This same panel performed on the right
upper lobe specimen show the neoplastic cells to be negative for
both CK7 and CK20. The cells are negative for CDX-2 and TTF1. Thecells are strongly positive for p63 .This staining pattern would
support this being a squamous carcinoma that is very poorly
differentiated .The immunohistochemical control slides stain
appropriately.

1.) Right lung: inflated, fixed right lung measuring 14 x 12 em at the base and up to 26 em high, central 
bronchus resection plane located 1 em upstream of the upper lobe bronchus. Dorsomedial and basal pleura over 
S10 shows an area of max. 7.5 x 4 em with roughening or residual adhesion, in the basal region over S7 is a 3 
em similar area, Intermediate bronchus in the region of the middle lobe bronchus bifurcation and proximal 
sections of the bronchi of the basal group narrowed by a moderately firm, predominantly pale brownish-white 
tumor with small patches of grayish-black pigmentation, max. 4.7 em in size, with unclear and arcuate 
demarcation, with the main mass in SIO and adjacent sections ofS6, S7 and S9, extending to within 0.2 em of

tumor. Focal crossing of lower pleural fissure and infiltration of middle lobe. In the tumor environment some 
satellite foci up to 0.2 em in size. Peripheral sections of basal bronchial branches dilated and filled with thick 
mucus. Parenchyma below the adhesion zone over SIO shows diffuse induration and a brown vitreous 
appearance. In the mediocaudal region of the upper lobe bronchus bifurcation next to the pulmonary artery a 2.5 
em node firmly adherent to the vascular wall with predominantly whitish section surfaces and extension right up

Microscopy 
Re 1.) Tumor made up to solid structures of large atypical epithelia, densely packed in parts, with copious, 
mostly stained cytoplasm with the inclusion of isolated very large, otl1erwise often round, occasionally 
deformed nuclei containing granular chromatin and always prominent nucleoli. Apoptoses, not uncommonly 
several mitoses per markedly enlarged visual field (field length 0.61 mm). Occasionally a vague epidermoid 
layer, often intercellular fissures and isolated visible bridges. No mucin inclusion. In places a dissociation of the 
tumor cell structures. Smaller areas of necrosis. Affected lung parenchyma pmtly destroyed, likewise a 
 relatively a large bronchus here, strand of cartilage remaining. A further large bronchus partially infiltrated and 
involved in the tumor, likewise in this area smaller bronchi and bronchioles whose lumen is partly dilated, the 
original respiratory epithelium replaced by tumor epithelium. In adjacent region tumor cell nests and fonnations 
of small tumor lie freely in alveoli, also tumor cell structures in dilated lymph vessels. Vascularized interlobular 
septa. between the tumor formations partly loose, partly fiber-rich, collagenous connective tissue with 
accumulation of iuflammatmy cells. Isolated small vessels here, walls thickened by elastosis and containing 
tumor cells. A larger vein surrounded, loose capillary-containing fiber tissue in the lumen. Between peripheral 
tumor margin and visceral pleura on the medial side a strip of free lung parenchyma with partly deficient 
atelectasis and thickened alveolar septa. Lower pleural fissure and partly fused visceral pleura demarcating or 
covering this fissure transcended by tumor, where large bronchi are invaded to within close proximity of the 
mucosa. Large tumor node next to the upper lobe bronchus bifurcation, enclosed anthracotic pigment, tumor 
cell nests here at the resection margin. In the mediastinal tissue a further tumor-compromised lymph node with 
anthracotic pigment deposits and otherwise fibrous growth of connective tissue. In subpleural region of Sl a flat 
remodeling zone of the lung parenchyma with development of collagenous and elastic connective tissue, with 
alveolar stroma still partly recognizable. Nearby tiny radial areas of interstitial fibrosis with small patches of 
accumulated anthracotic pigment. In the basal lower lobe am relatively large area of nonoxygenated, fibrosed 
lung parenchyma with inclusion of partly obliterated smaller, partly patent vessels and bronchioles. Overlying 
pleura markedly enlarged and fibrotic. Otherwise here and there in dilated peripheral ainvays mucus and 
leukocytes and also a small cluster of pigment-storing macrophages in the alveoli. At the bronchus resection 
margin, sections of mucosal epithelium are interrupted, othenvise regular. Here as in the walls of the large 
pulmonary vessels no evidence of tumor cells. Lymph node at the hilus with isolated secondary follicles, slight 
plaque of anthracotic pigment and foci oflarge macrophages. 
Re 2.) -b.) Partly preserved lymph nodes with few secondary follicles, varying degrees of anthracotic pigment 
deposits, accumulation of macrophages and isolated secondary follicles. In parts, lymph nodes are largely 
occupied by solid epithelial tumor. In places, tumor manifestation also in the paranodal tissue. At one point and 
in a larger lymph node only very small areas occupied by tumor cell nests. 
EVALUATION 
Primary diagnosis/diagnoses: 
Central bronchopulmonary, histologically largely undifferentiated, large-cell squamous cell carcinoma of the 
right lower lobe of the lung (C4) with overgrowth of the interlobar fissure and continuous growth into the 
adjacent section of the middle lobe and also several in some cases large lymph node metastases. Tumor 
classification according to this picture pT2 pN3 Ll VI Rl, stage IIIB. C34.3 M8070/3. 
Secondary diagnosis/diagnoses: 
Peripheral bronchiolectasia in the lower lobe, relatively large fibrous cicatricial remodeling zone in S I 0 
mediobasal and similar flat subpleural cicatricial zones in Sl apical. Local high-grade pleural fibrosis over SlO. 
Twnor-associated inflammation and small tumor necroses. Slight anthracotic pigment deposits in the lung 
parenchyma and relatively marked in some lymph nodes. 
Remark/addendum: 
The main mass of the carcinoma lies in SJO. Centrally it has grown as far as the bifurcations of the lower lobe 
main bronchus and the middle lobe bronchus, without these being destroyed or constricted. The tumor invasion 
of small blood vessels only concerns the focal region, the lymphangioinvasion is more marked and is also 
located in the vicinity of the tumor focus. The Rl classification is based on the fmding that carcinoma nests in 
the large involved lymph nodes next to the bifurcation of the upper lobe bronchus extend to the mediastinal 
resection plane. Further lymph node metastases are seen at the intermediate bronchus in the mediastinum and 
also in the lymph nodes located under 4.) -6.). The pN3 classification is also made with regard to the previous 
finding with carcinoma cell structures in the fine needle aspiration biopsy from LN4 left (according to clinical 
data). "," Site: Central bronchopulmonary carcinoma in the right lower lobe of the lung

Procedure:   
 
Diagnosis 
A.  Lung, left lower lobe, excision - 
Poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (see microscopic 
description). 
Margins negative for malignancy. 
Metastatic carcinoma in three of fourteen (3/14) hilar lymph nodes. 
 
B,C,D.  Lymph nodes, level 9, level 7, and level 5, excisions - 
Negative for tumor. 
 
Microscopic Description: 
Histologic type: Squamous cell carcinoma comprising the mass lesion in 
part A 
Histologic grade: Poorly differentiated 
Primary tumor (pT):  pT2a.  The carcinoma is 3.5 cm in greatest 
dimension.  To the extent assessable given fragmentation, there is not 
pleural invasion. 
Margins of resection: Negative 
Direct extension of tumor: Not definitively identified 
Vascular invasion: Not identified 
Regional lymph nodes (pN):  pN1.  There is metastatic carcinoma in 
three of fourteen (3/14) hilar lymph nodes identified in part A.  The 
separately submitted lymph nodes in parts B, C, & D are negative for 
tumor. 
Distant metastasis (pM):  Not applicable 
Other findings: Scattered chronic inflammation and emphysematous 
changes 
 Note:  The carcinoma immunostains for p63 and not for TTF- 1, nor does 
it immunostain for synaptophysin or chromogranin.  This supports 
classification of this non- small cell carcinoma as poorly 
differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. 
 
[A few of the antibodies used in our laboratory may be classified as 
analyte specific reagents.  These antibodies are monitored and 
controlled in our laboratory and their perforance for in vitro 
diagnosis is well described in the medical literature.  They have not

Gross Description 
A.  Received fresh in a container labeled ""left lower lobe"" is a 187 g, 
18 x 9.5 x 5 cm, lobectomy specimen.  The bronchial stump is 1.5 cm 
long and without focal lesion.  The vascular margin is also grossly 
unremarkable.  The pleural surface is smooth glistening tan- red.  There 
is a torn area on the pleural surface revealing a 3.5 x 3 x 2.5 cm 
tan-pink mass.  Although the prior tearing limits assessment, the mass 
does not appear to involve the pleura.  The lung away from the mass is 
spongy and tan- pink, without additional lesions.  There are gray- black 
lymph nodes in the hilar region up to 0.8 cm in greatest dimension. 
RS-12, following fixation, according to the accompanying block summary. 
 Please note tissue is taken for tissue procurement per the clinical 
request.

GROSS 
A. HRight upper lobe freeze bronchial margins ."" Received fresh for 
immediate evaluation and frozen section analysis is a partly 
collaps ed lobe of lung, which has a small a'llount of hemorrhage over 
the surface . Most of the pleural surfaces are smooth, glistening 
and light to medium purple-brown. It weighs 2ilO grams. The 
bronchial resection margin portion of the most hilar aspect of the 
specimen is a bronchus 1.1 x 0.9 em across. This resection margin 
is shaved from the specimen and submitted as a frozen section block. 
Two nodules are palpated in the upper aspect of the lobe and both 
show some degree of overlying puckering of the pleural surfaces . 
These are marked by me with blue dye. The more lateral lesion is 
cut across and reveals a subpleural , Io.'hite and gray speckled lesion 
2.0 x 1.7 cm on cut surface. A portion of this is removed for the 
tumor genome project in the usual manner. The second nodule, which 
is more apically situated , has its epicenter about 2 em away from 
the lesion mentioned above and has more of a yellowish cut surface , 
is well circumscribed and up to 1.8 x 1.7 cm and presents focally 
just beneath the pleural surface, also with some overlying puckeri ng 
of plerua. A portion of this tumor is also sampled for the tumor 
genome project . 
After preparat ion of the frozen section, the frozen section remnant 
is placed in a block and the remainder of the tissue is fixed prior 
to further processing .

FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS 
A. Bronchial resection margin negative for tumor. - MICROSCOPIC 
A. The frozen section control confirms the frozen section findings 
of a proximal bronchial resection margin that is negative for tumor. 
The t\'10 foci containing gross tumor, the more laterally situated and 
the more atypically situated have identical histology with areas 
showing adenocarcinoma growing in scar tissue \"",ith some areas 
showing more clear cell patterns to the cytoplasm and other areas 
having more eosinophilic and darker cytoplasm . Some of the latter 
tumor grows in a lepidic pattern including focally into the visceral 
pleura, with at least one small focus deposited and stuck to the 
outside of the visceral pleura ). Deeper sections have been 
made of these foci. The section taken between the two nodules, 
although not grossly involved, has microscopic involvement of 
additional invasive adenocarcinoma which therefore shows a 
connection between these two otherwise apparently separate nodules . 
Thus, I think this is a single tumor with a so-called dumbbell shape 
and both foci of tumors making the larger nodules have mixtures of 
clear-type cytoplasm and eosinophilic-type cytoplasm . Emphysema is 
also found within the lung. 
A focus of tumor shows growth into a thick-walled blood vessel, 
probably a vein. A single parabronchial lymph node is found and is 
negative for metastatic disease.

 CLINICAL HISTORY AND PRE - OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  
Lung mass.  
 
MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:  
The specimen is received in four parts, each labeled with the  
 patient's name.  
 
1. Part one is received fresh, labeled 'left upper lobe wedge  
resection, r/o carcinoma'. It consists of a wedge shaped portion of  
lung, measuring 9 x 4 x 4 cm. The specimen weighs 36 grams. There is  
a staple line identified on the specimen measuring 9 cm and 3 cm in length. The staple line is inked black and the pleural surface is  
inked blue. The pleural surface shows dimpling at one area. Serial  
sectioning of the specimen reveals a gray white firm irregular mass,  
measuring 3.5 x 3.4 x 1.8 cm. The mass is 1 cm away from the s taple  
line. The mass has a gray white cut surface. The remainder of the  
lung has tan pink spongy parenchyma. One piece cut from the mass is  
submitted for intraoperative microscopic examination. Representative  
sections are submitted.  
 2. Part two is received in formalin, labeled 'station #9 lymph  
node'. It consists of a single piece of tan maroon irregular soft  
tissue, measuring 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm. The specimen is bisected and  
entirely submitted.  
 3. Part three is received in formalin, labeled 'station #11 l ymph  
node'. It consists of a single piece of tan maroon irregular soft  
tissue consistent with lymph node, measuring 1.5 x 0.9 x 0.2 cm. The  
specimen is bisected and entirely submitted for microscopic  
examination.  
 4. Part four is labeled 'upper lobe completion lobectomy'. It  
consists of a lobe of lung measuring 15 x 8 x 4 cm. The specimen 
weighs 169 grams. There are two staple lines identified on the  
specimen, measuring 15 cm and 8 cm in length. The staple line is  
inked black. The bronchus measures 2.5 cm in diameter and the  
bronchial vessels measures 2.0 cm in diameter. The bronchial  
vascular margin is shaved. Serial sectioning of the specimen shows  
tan maroon spongy parenchyma. No definite mass lesion or fibrosis is  
identified. Representative sections are submitted for microscopic  
examination.

  MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY  
 KRAS MUT ATION ANALYSIS  
 
Specimen #
Body Site: Left upper lobe of lung  
Specimen Type: Slides  
Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma  
 RESULTS: Wild -type gene.  
 INTERPRETATION:  
No mutations were identified at codons 12 and 13 of the KRAS gene.  
 COMMENT:  
Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to be associated with poor  
prognosis, and resistance to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor  
therapies in patients with non- small- cell lung cancer (NSCLC). KRAS  
mutations occur in 15- 30% of NSCLC patients and are strongly 
associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking history.  
 This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;  
based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are  
expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of  
the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low  
percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated  
for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and codon 13 mutations in  
fresh, frozen, or formalin- fixed paraffin embedded tissue. In  
particular the test performance has been established in samples of  
colorectal cancer and non- small cell lung carcinoma which harbor  
these mutations, although several other tissues are also known to  
harbor KRAS mutations (e.g.  tumors of pancreas, bile duct, ovary,  
appendix, etc.).  
 Analysis of EGFR mutation or gene amplification status may provide  
additional information regarding this patient's probability of  
 response to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies, if  
clinical ly indicated. See references.  
 
 
METHOD/LIMITATIONS:  
Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is  
selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified  
and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to 
exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single  
nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;  
primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel  
electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or  
nega tive results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants  
or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

ADDENDUM #3:  
  EGFR Mutation Analysis  
 
 
 Body Site: Left upper lobe of lung  
 Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma  
 RESULTS: No mutation detected  
 
INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified; however 18- 20% of  
patients with non- small- cell lung cancer and without identifiable  
mutations are reported to be responsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase  
inhibitor therapies.  
  
COMMENT: This assay analyzes exons 18- 21 of the EGFR tyrosine  
kinase domain; based on the current literature, the vast majority of  
mutations are expected to occur in these exons. The analytical  
sensitivity of the assay is 10- 20%, thus mutations present in a low  
percentage of cells may not be detected.  
 Most data published to date pertain to gefitinib (Iressa(r)).  
Similar data have been seen in studies using erlotinib (Tarceva(r)).  
 
Homozygosity for the frequently occurring sequence change 2361 G>A  
was identified. The polymorphism is not likely to have clinical  
significance.  
 
This test is validated for non- small cell lung carcinoma. The 
clinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types  
is unknown.  
 METHOD/LIMITATION: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is  
selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the samples, quantified  
 and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to 
exons 18- 21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by  
bi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary electrophoresis  
and fluorescence detection. False positive or negative results may  
occur for reasons that include genetic variants or somatic  
heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

 FINDINGS: FISH was performed on paraffin embedded tissue sections  
using dual color break -apart probe ) to the  
gene at 2p23. this probe flanks the entire gene. If a rearrangement  
involving ALK is present, inversion or translocation, one of the two  
probe signals separates as one red (orange) and one green signal. In  
this specimen, separated signals were present in 0% of the nuclei  
scored. Based on laboratory validation data, these results are  
within the normal limits.

MACROSCOPIC 
Nine specimens received. 
I: The specimen is labelled ""R uppcr lobe"" and consists of an upper lobe measuring 190 x 85 x 45 
mm. Just superior and lateral to the main bronchus is a nImour which, on the external surface, 
measures approximately 38 rom in diameter. On sectioning the nImour measures 28 mm. Distal to this 
there is bronchiectasis and some endogenous lipid pneumonia. Adjacent 10 the mass there appears to 
be an adherent involved lymph node. Sectioning of the lung tissue away from Ihe tumour reveals no 
other lesions. A longue of tumour protrudes into the main bronchus but invasive tumour appears to be 
clcar by at least 5 mm. [Bronchus and peribronchial lymph nodes, A; tumour, B-C; adherent 
apparently involved lymph node, D; tongue of tumour and adjacent bronchus, E; lung tissue distal to 
the tumour, F; random section of lung, G]. 
2: The specimen is labelled ""right middle lobe lymph node"" and consists ofa fragment of grey-black 
tissue measuring 23 x 23 x 5 mm. [[Wrapped and blocked in tOIO, 2A]. 
3: The specimen is labelled ""right upper lobe lymph node"" and consists of two pieces of lymph node 
tissue, one of which measures 25 x 12 x 8 mm, and the other measures 7 mm in maximal dimension. 
[The largest piece bisected and all wrapped and BIT, 3AJ. 
4: The specimen is labelled ""No.7 lymph node"" and consists of three pieces oflymph node tissue 
measuring 35 x 25 x 6 nun in aggregate. [BIT,4A]. 
5: The specimen is labelled ""No.8 lymph node"" and consists of pieces of lymph node measuring 32 x 
20 x 5 nun. [Wrapped and blocked in toto, 5A]. 
6: The specimen is labelled ""No.9 lymph node"" and consists of a piece of lymph node measuring 13 x 
6 x 3 nun. (BIT,6A). 
7: The specimen is labelled ""azygous"" and consists ofa piece of blackened lymph node measuring 13 
x 8 x 7 mm. [BIT as lTS, 7A). 
8: The specimen is labelled ""right main bronchus"" and consists of a piece of lymph node measuring 18 
x 13 x 10 mm. There is no apparent adherent bronchus. On sectioning the node has a sclerotic 
appearance and has white and yellow flecks. [BIT as 3TS, 8A]. 
9: The specimen is labelled ""right bronchial stump"" and consists ofa segment of bronchus with a 
staples measuring 23 x 10 x 5 mrn. [Blocked as 2TS .away from the staple line, 9Al 
MICROSCOPY 
I: Sections show a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. There is prominent endobronchial 
component. In situ squamous cell carcinoma extends to the bronchial resection margin but the margin 
appears clear of invasive tumour. In one area, the overlying pleura appears thickened and scarred. 
There are fcatures suspicious for pleural invasion within this area and special stains will be perfonned 
to assess this. The tumour is not present on the pleural surface. No blood vessel, lymphatic or 
perineura l invasion is seen. The tumour appears to directly invade a pcribronchiallymph node. The 
adjacent lung shows no significant changes. 
2: Sections of the lymph nodes show reactive changes only. There is no evidence of malignancy. 
3: Sections of the lymph nodes show reactive changes only. There is no evidence of malignancy. 
4: Sections of the lymph nodes show reactive changes only. There is no evidence of malignancy. 
5: Sections of the lymph nodes show reactive changes only. There is no evidence of malignancy.  6: Sections of the lymph nodes show reactive changes only. There is no evidence of malignancy. 
7: Sections of the lymph nodes show reactive changes and a small silicotic nodule. There is no 
evidence of malignancy. 
8: Sections show squamous cell carcinoma, which is surrounde d by a dense fibrous capsule. Some 
lymphoid aggregates present in this region and it is presumed that this deposit of squamous cell 
carcinoma is present within a lymph node. An adjacent smaller lymph node is present and this shows 
reactive changes only. No bronchial wall is present for assessmenl. Tumour extends ex.tremely closely 
to the diathennicd resection margin. 
9: Sections of the bronchus show a small amount of residual squamous cell carcinoma in SifU. No 
invasive carcinoma is seen. 
SUMMARY 
Right upper lobe and hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes: 
I: Poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma; 28 mm in maximal dimension. 
2; No blood vessel, lymphatic or perineural invasion present.

1: The specimen is labelled ` left upper lobe' and consists of a lobectomy
specimen measuring In its partially Inflated state 210 x 150 x 50 mm. Two
separate bronchi are seen at the hilum ranging In size from 10 to 12. mm In
diameter (lying approximately 30 mm apart), Surrounding the two bronchi is a
bare. area measuring 55 mm in maximal diameter. A staple line Is seen radiating
from the hilar to the periphery, it measures 80 mm In length. Differential
inking Is. as follows ,the bare area Is inked black and the staple line is
removed and Inked blue. The pleural surface Is tan to grey with a diffuse area
of Induration over the lateral lower aspect of the lobe extending over the
lingular, which measures 60 mm in greatest dimension. There Is also scarring
over the apex measuring 15. mm In greatest dimension. The cut surface of the
lung shows a centrally based/pert-bronchial tumour measuring 35 mm In greatest
dimension. It extends peripherally to focally abut the pleural surface
(posterior lateral). Definite macroscopic invasion of the pleura is not seen.
The tumour has a white firm cut surface with focal areas of necrosis. It Iles
10 mm from the closest bronchial margin. A second firm tan nodule measuring 6
mm in greatest. dimension in the apical portion of the lobe. It Iles 2 mm from
the pleural surface (appears to abut the pleural surface) and over 70 mm to the
bronchial margin and 65 mm from the main tumour mass. There is normal
intervening lung. The residual lung shows moderate to. severe emphysema and an
area of pleurally based fibrosis adjacent to the induration over the
lingular/lateral surface. (1A, bronchial margin; 18, hilar lymph nodes; 1C-D,

is clear of the bronchial resection margin .Within the confines of the tumour
there is focal vascular and lymphatic invasion .No perineural permeation by
tumour Is seen .Peribronchial lymph nodes show reactive changes with sinus
histiocytosis ,carbon pigment deposition and scattered flecks of birefringent
material in keeping with silicate .No tumour is identified within these nodes.
Immediately adjacent to the tumour there is focal change within lung parenchyma
in keeping with obstructive pneumonitis characterised by focal organising
pneumonia, mild acute alveolitis, and a few collections of intra -alveolar foamy
macrophages .Marked emphysema is present. Associated with a mixed dust macule
there is a small non -necrotising granuloma. The separately described
macroscopic lesions represent foci of scarring and organising pneumonia. No
tumour is identified within these areas.

MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received in saline , in five parts, each labeled with
the patient 's name.
1.Part one is received fresh, labeled 'lung, right upper lobe wedge
'.It consists of one lung wedge resection specimen measuring 10 x
5.5 x 2 .3 cm. There is a focal area of indurated pleura overlying a
mass .The pleural surface is inked black .The stapled line is
removed and the underlying pleura and parenchyma is inked green.
The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a poorly circumscribed
heterogeneous tan mass measuring 2.5 x 2 .3 x 1.7 cm at a distance of
0.5 cm from the surgical margin and abutting the pleura. A
representative section is frozen for intraoperative evaluation.
Representative sections submitted , IA-U.
2. Part two is received in saline, labeled ' level 7 lymph node
right'. It consists of one piece of anthracotic soft tissue
measuring 1.5 x 1.2 x 0.5 cm. Entirely submitted, 2A.
3. Part three is received in saline, labeled 'level 10 lymph node,
right'. It consists of multiple pieces of anthracotic soft tissue
measuring 1.5 x 1 x 0.7 cm in aggregate, ranging in size from 0.4 cm
to 1 cm in greatest dimension. The largest lymph node is bisected.
Entirely submitted, 3A-3B.
4. Part four is received in saline, labeled' completion right upper
lobectomy'. It consists of one lobectomy specimen measuring 13.5 x
8 x 3.5 cm. The pleura is soft with a bluish-purple color and focal
areas of hemorrhage. There is a stapled line running along the
hilar aspect longitudinally measuring 12 cm in length. This line is
inked green. On the opposite aspect of the specimen there is another
staple line measuring 11 cm in length that is inked black. The
bronchial and vascular stapled margins are removed and shaved sections are submitted. Multiple lymph nodes are dissected from the
hilar region, the largest measuring 0.7 cm in greatest dimension.
The specimen is serially sectioned and no abnormalities are found.
Representative sections submitted 4A-4F.
5. Part five is received in saline , labeled 'level 4 lymph node
right'. It consists of two pieces of yellow fatty tissue measuring
0.8 x 0.6 x 0.2 cm and 0.9 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm. Each piece contains one
black nodule measuring 0.2 cm. Entirely submitted, 5A.

ADDENDUM 3:

MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY
KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS
RESULTS: Positive for a p.G12C (c.34G> T) mutation in codon 12 of the KRAS gene.
INTERPRETATION: Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to
correlate with poor prognosis and resistance to tyrosine kinase
inhibitor therapies in patients with non-small lung cancer.
COMMENT:
KRAS mutations occur in 15-30% of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
patients and are strongly associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking
history.
This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;
based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are
expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of
the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low
percentage of cells may not be detected.
This test is validated for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and
codon 13 mutations in fresh, frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin
embedded tissue. In particular the test performance has been
established in samples of colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung
carcinoma which harbor these mutations, although several other
tissues are also known to harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of
pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix, etc.).
METHOD/LIMITATION:
Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is
selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified
and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to
exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single
nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;
primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel
electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or
negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants
or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

ADDENDUM # 4:
EGFR Mutation Analysis
Referring Physician:
Body Site: Right upper lobe of lung
Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma, mucinous type
RESULTS: No mutation detected.
INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified in the sample provided
for analysis .Fewer than 5% of non-small cell lung carcinoma
patients without identifiable mutations are reported to be
responsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies.
COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more tumor cellularity is optimal
for this mutation analysis .The sample submitted showed 80% tumor cellularity upon pathologist review.
A frequently occurring sequence change 2361>GA (Q787Q) was
identified .This polymorphism is known not to have clinical
significance.
Mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with
differential responsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase
inhibitor (TKI) therapies .The objective response rate among
patients with a sensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%.
This assay analyzes exons 18 -21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain;
based on the current literature ,most mutations in non-small-cell
lung carcinoma (NSCLC) are expected to occur in these exons.
Mutations present in less than 10-20% of extracted DNA may not be
detected by this method .Mutation status in a sample may change
during tumor progression or the course of therapy; therefore, this
result cannot be used to infer the presence or absence of a mutation
in another sample or sub-sample obtained from this tumor.
This testis validated for non- small cell lung carcinoma. The
clinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types
is unknown.
METHOD:
Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is
selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified
and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to
exons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by
bi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary gel
electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or
negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants
or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

Gross Description:
A. Received in formalin is a specimen labeled ""left lung"". The specimen consists of a lung
measuring 15 x 10 x 7.5 cm, tightly adhered pericardium measuring 10 x 8.5 x 0.5 cm and diaphragm
measuring 4.5 x 2 x 0.2 cm. The specimen weighs 606 grams. The bronchial remnant measures 2.4
cm in length and 1.4 cm in diameter. The pericardium is inked green, the diaphragm margin is inked
black, the mediastinal soft tissue margin and perihilar pleural surface is inked blue. The pleura is
incomplete on the lateral aspect of the lung on both the upper and lower lobes (orange ink). The
diaphragmatic surface of the lung is also incomplete with an open defect showing a visibly necrotic
cavity within the lower lobe of the lung. No areas of puckering are present along the pleural surface.
The specimen is sectioned in a transverse plane to reveal a firm, gray-white mass with central necrosis
measuring 8 x 7 x 6 cm. The necrosis is more prominent in the most inferior aspect of the lung. The
greatest dimension of the mass is in the cranial caudal plane. The mass is present from the hilar region
and extends inferior through the lower lobe to the diaphragmatic aspect. The lung parenchyma adjacent
to the mass is soft and tan-orange. The upper and lower lobes are firmly adhered at the oblique fissure
in the area of the mass showing possible involvement in the upper lobe (section A14). The mass does
involve the bronchus and extending within 1.5 cm from the bronchial margin .The mass grossly abuts
the diaphragm margin (black inked), the medial pleural surface at the level surrounding the hilum (blue
inked) and the lateral pleural defect (inked orange). The mass comes within 0.3 cm of the mediastinal
tissue margin (blue inked) and within 0.5 cm of the pericardial margin ( green inked). The vessels at the
hilar level appear to be grossly involved. Mucous plugs are identified diffusely throughout the bronchi.
The mucous plugs are prominent within the posterior aspect of the upper and lower lobe bronchioles
ranging in size from 0.1 to 0.2 cm. The upper lobe lung parenchyma appears grossly unremarkable and
is smooth, red and spongy. No intraparenchymal lymph nodes are identified. Peribronchial lymph
nodes are identified and range in size from 0.3 to 1.3 cm. Perihilar lymph nodes are identified and
range in size from 0.9 to 1.6 cm. Representative sections are submitted as follows: A2 - vascular
shave margin; A3 -A5 - mass in relationship to diaphragm; A6 - mass in relationship to mediastinal soft
tissue margin; A7 and A8 - mass in relationship to pericardial margin; A9 - mass in relationship to
bronchus and pleura; A10 through A13 - mass in relationship to pleural margin; A14 - mass at lung
fissure ;A15 - mass in relationship to hilar vasculature; A16 - mass in relationship to lateral pleural
defect; All and Al 8 - additional sections of mass non-marginal; Al 9 and A20 - sections of upper lobe
posterior aspect with mucus plugs; A21 - section of upper lobe anterior aspect; A22 - section of upper
lobe middle aspect; A23 - section of apex; A24 - perihilar lymph nodes; A25- A26 - peribronchial lymph

Lung,Left,Squamous cell carcinoma,T2 N0,,,TCGA-77-7463.pdf,"LEFT UPPER LOBECTOMY 
Clinical Details: 
FNA: Squamous cell carcinoma. 
Macroscopy: 
The specimen weighs 180 g and comprises a lobe oflung with appearances in keeping with left upper 
lobe. Within the superior lingular segment there is a tumour nodule measuring 30 x 28 x 25 mm. It is 
situated at a distance of25 rrun from the bronchial resection margin. The tumour has caused puckering 
of the overlying pleura. No pleural surface Involvement is seen macroscopically. Inferior to this 
nodule, at a distance of20 mm, there is a hard circumscribed fibrous nodule showing central caseation, 
measuring 14 mrn in maximum diameter. Within the anterior segment there is a subpleural dark grey 
nodule measuring 6 mrn in maximum diameter. The lung parenchyma otherwise appears normal. [A, 
bronchial resection margin to lingular segment; B, bronchial resection margin to anterior and apico­
posterior segments; C, lymph nodes at resection margin; D, small subpleural nodule anterior segment; 
E, apex; F, anterior segment; G, nodule lingular segment; H-K,. RS of tumour including pleura in each 
section (note: an endobronchial origin is not identified macroscopically)). 
Microscopy: 
Sections show a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma which abuts but does not directly 
invade the plewa. However there is lymphatic permeation which does involve pleural lymphatics. No 
vascular invasion is identified . Peribronchial lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy. The 
subpleural nodule in the anterior segment is shown to represent a silicotic nodule. The larger nodule in 
the lingular segment has a similar histological appearance but shows extensive central necrosis. 
Special stains will be performed to exclude superimposed infection. 
Conclusion: 
Left upper lobectomy: 
Moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, 30 mm in diameter. 
Lymphatic invasion present, involving pleura. 
No vascular invasion is seen 
No lymph node metastasis present.

PART #1 :FS: RIGHT UPPER LOBE
Resident Pathologist:
FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS --
FS:RIGHT UPPER LOBE :STAPLED MARGIN NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.
The specimen is received fresh labeled nd
designated right upper lobe .it consists o a grossly recognizable
lobe of lung that weighs 250 gms, and measures 20 x 9 .5 x 3.5 cm. The
staple parenchymal margin measures 17 cm in length .The entire
parenchymal margin will be sampled for histology .One particular area
of concern raised by the surgeon was frozen with frozen section
diagnosis as above .There is in fact some firmness felt underneath the
parenchymal margin .Upon serially sectioning through the lung, this
area of firmness appears to be secondary to bronchopneumonia .A tumor
mass is identified which measures 3.2 cm in greatest dimension. This
white tan tumor mass approaches the parenchymal margin no closer than
4.2 cm. Between this nodule and the overlying stapled parenchymal
margin-is the area of firmness consistent with bronchopneumonia.
There is however one additional smaller nodule that is white tan in
colormeasuring 1.0 cm in greatest dimension .This other nodule is
separate from the main tumor nodule .This nodule is surrounded by the
firm gray tan tissue reminescent of pneumonia .This second nodule
approaches the stapled parenchymal margin ,no closer than 2 .2 cm. The
bronchial and vascular margins grossly appears well away from the
tumor and approach no closer that 4 .0 cm from the main tumor mass,
and 6.2 cm from the other suspicious smaller nodule .in the area of
the lung adjacent to the tumor in the area away from the pneumonia.
the lung appears focally cystic .The remainder of the lung specimen
is congested .No other lesions are identified .Black and white and
color photographs of the specimen are taken .In one region the tumor
appears grossly to approach the overlying pleural surface with some of
focal hardening and puckering of the surface .

Justification: The report describes a white tan tumor mass in the lung, which is a common characteristic of lung malignancies. Additionally, there is a second nodule that is separate from the main tumor, and its etiology is not definitively determined in the report. Therefore, it is appropriate to classify both lesions as potentially malignant until further information is available.

 COMMENT: In the biopsy from the pleura there is a microscopic nodule of Langerhans ceJls 
and accompanying eosinophils. The significance of this is not clear, but it is possible that the 
patient has an underlying pulmonary Langerhans ceJI histiocytosis (PLCH) related to tobacco use. 
There is scarring in the accompanying lung tissue which could be related to this process, but 
definitive evidence of PLCH in the lung is not otherwise seen.

COMMENT 
Sections show a poorly differentiated central tumor with focal evidence 
of squamous differentiation. The tumor focally invades small venous 
vessels. By immunohistochemistry, the tumor stains positive for high 
molecular weight keratin, CKS/6, and p63, focally positive for CD56, and 
negative for CK7, CK20, TTF-1, chromogranin, and synaptophysin, 
consistent with squamous cell carcinoma. Selected slides from the 
patient• s previous resection  were reviewed for comparison, 
and show a squamous cell carcinoma with extensive keratinization that 
appears morphologically different from the present tumor. While a 
dedifferentiated metastasis cannot be definitively excluded, the present 
lung tumor is therefore favored to represent a second primary squamous 
cell. carcinoma, stage pT2N1. 
GROSS DESCRIPTION 
1. The specimen container labeled with the patient's name and as ""lymph 
•de: ST10L TB angle"". The specimen is received in 10% buffered formalin 
-•ld consists of two irregular pieces of brown-tan, focally hemorrhagic, 
Page: 2 of 4 
 soft to firm tissue ranging in size from 0.8 x 0.3 x 0.3 em up to 2.5 x 
0.6 x 0.4 em. Cross sectioning reveals three probable lymph nodes, the 
largest measuring 0.7 em in diameter. The cut surface of the lymph nodes 
is homogeneously tan, focally hemorrhagic and firm. The specimen is 
submitted in toto as follows: 
1A to 1C -one bisected probable lymph node per block 
2. The specimen container labeled with the patient's name and as ""lymph 
node: ST11 interlobar"". The specimen is received in 10% buffered formalin 
and consists of two pieces of black to tan, firm tissue; ranging in size 
from 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.2 em up to 0.7 x 0.3 x 0.3 em. -, -specimen submitted in toto 
3. The specimen container labeled with the patient's name and as ""lymph 
node: ST11 interlobar"". The specimen is received in 10% buffered formalin 
and consists of an irregular, brown-tan, firm piece of tissue measuring 
1.7 x 0.6 x 0.5 em. on sectioning, the cut surface is homogeneously tan 
and focally hemorrhagic. 
3A -specimen bisected and submitted in toto. 
4. The specimen container is labeled with the patient's name and as 
""lungs: LLL with resection margins"". The specimen is received fresh and 
subsequently placed into 10% buffered formalin. It contains a left lower 
lobe of lung. The overall measurement of the specimen is 17.7 x 11.5 x 6 
em. The pleural surface appears purple-tan and smooth. one dark purple, 
congested area is seen within the pleura. Cross sections of this area 
reveal one large, well circumscribed tumour measuring 4 x 4 x 3.7 em. 
Cross sections of the tumour appear homogeneously white-tan, friable and 
necrotic in the· centre; tan and firm towards the periphery. The tumour 
is located 0.3 em from the closest pleural surface and approximately 0.8 
em from the bronchial resection line. However, the tumour is seen 
invading one of the adjacent bronchi, completely obliterating the 
bronchial wall and invading into the lumen. The tumour is located 
approximately 0.2 em from the resection margin of this bronchus. Further 
sectioning of the lobe shows a homogenously brown-tan parenchyma with 
dilated bronchi, which appear partially calcified. The lumina of the 
bronchi show white/tan gelatinous material within them. Multiple 
probable lymph nodes are identified, the largest measuring 1.5 em in 
diameter and is located at the hilar region of the specimen.

Justification: The specimen is labeled as ""lungs: LLL with resection margins"" and a detailed description of the tumor located in the left lower lobe is provided.

Laterality: Left
Justification: The tumor is found in the left lower lobe, therefore it is a left-sided lung cancer.

Histology: Squamous cell carcinoma
Justification: The tumor stains positive for high molecular weight keratin, CKS/6, and p63, focally positive for CD56, and negative for CK7, CK20, TTF-1, chromogranin, and synaptophysin, consistent with squamous cell carcinoma.

Stage: pT2N1
Justification: The report provides information about the tumor size (pT2) and lymph node involvement (N1). However, the absence of information about distant metastasis (M) prevents a complete staging.

Grade: Not provided
Justification: The report does not include information regarding the degree of differentiation or the grade of the tumor.

Behavior: Malignant
Justification: The tumor is invasive, obliterating the bronchial wall and invading into the lumen, consistent with a malignant behavior.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

mottled with a palpable mass seen just superior to the bronchus. This area 
is inked blue. The staple line is removed, the specimen is sectioned. Cut 
section of the specimen reveals a white lobulated tumor mass corresponding 
to that seen at the mainstem bronchus and palpated. There are dilated 
airways throughout the specimen that are filled with thick yellow-tan 
mucoid material surrounded by tan-pink spongy mildly anthracotic 
parenchyma. The tumor measures 6.5 x 4.3 x 3 cm. The tumor is 1.5 cm from 
the nearest orange-inked staple line. No additional satellite lesions are

Gross Description:  
The specimens are received in six formalin filled containers, all labeled with 
the patient's name  
Part A is additionally labeled ""right lung (for precision)."" The specimen 
consists of a right lung with dimensions of 21 x 12 x 6.5 cm. The lung has a  
weight of 400 grams. There are multiple stapled vascular structures present at  
the hilum.   Additionally, there are staple lines within the parenchyma that have  
a total length of 13 cm.   The surgical staple lines are removed and the  
parenchymal margins are inked blue.   The pleural surface of the specimen is  
gray-purple to tan- white and generally smooth. The pleural surface has been  
inked black overlying the area of the mass and a portion of the tissue sent for  
precision diagnostic studies.   The specimen is remarkable for a firm tan- white  
fungating mass within the bronchus of the right upper lobe.   Serial sectioning  
reveals that the mass has overall dimensions of 6 x 5 x 4 cm.   The cut surfaces  
of the mass are firm, tan- white and heterogeneous with areas of necrosis and  
hemorrhage. The mass appears to fill the majority of the right upper bronchus  
and erode through the wall. It comes to within 0.1 cm of the pleural surface.  
The mass comes to within 0.5 cm of the inked parenchymal margin. The remaining  
uninvolved lung is pink -tan to red- brown and spongy. The bronchial spaces are  
filled with gray-green mucoid material. Multiple lymph nodes are present  
adjacent to the hilar structures.   These range in greatest dimension from 0.5 to 
1.3 cm.  
 Cassettes are submitted as follows:  
     A1      vascular margin;  
      A2 -3     mass in right upper bronchus;  
     A4      mass to nearest parenchymal margin;  
     A5 -6     remaining parenchymal margin taken en face;  
     A7      mass to pleura;  
     A8 -11     additional representative sections of mass;  
     A12     uninvolved lung;  
     A13- 15     mult iple lymph nodes submitted in toto;  
     A16     one lymph node bisected.  
 Part B is additionally labeled ""level 7 subcarinal lymph node.""   The specimen 
consists of a gray -tan irregular tissue with dimensions of 3.8 x 3 x 1 cm.   This  
may represent a single lymph node or multiple matted lymph nodes. Sectioning  
reveals multiple tan- white areas of discoloration within the tissue, as well as  
focal calcification.   The specimen is serially sectioned and submitted entirely  
in cassettes B1- B5 following decalcifica tion.  
 Part C is additionally labeled ""upper paratracheal lymph node."" The specimen consists of a portion of yellow -tan fibrofatty tissue with dimensions of 3.3 x  
2.3 x 0.6 cm. Multiple probable lymph nodes are identified with greatest  
dimensions ranging from 0.3 to 0.6 cm. These nodes are submitted in toto in  
cassette C1.  
 Part D is additionally labeled ""lower paratracheal lymph node."" The specimen 
consists of a portion of yellow -tan lobulated fibrofatty tissue with dimensions  
of 4.2 x 3.1 x 1.5 cm. Palpation and sectioning reveals multiple probable lymph  
nodes with greatest dimensions ranging from 0.4 to 3 cm. Sectioning of the  
largest of these nodes reveals abundant calcification.  
 Cassettes are submitted as follows:  
     D1 -2     multiple whole probable lymph nodes;  
     D3 -5     one lymph node submitted entirely, pending decalcification.  
 
Part E is additionally labeled ""level 10 lymph node."" The specimen consists of  
two portions of gray -tan fibrofatty tissue with dimensions of 1.6 x 0.7 x 0.3 cm  
and 1.5 x 1.2 x 0.5 cm. The smaller tissue is submitted in toto in cassette E1.  
The larger tissue is bisected and submitted entirely in cassette E2.  
 Part F is additionally labeled ""bronchial margin."" The specimen is received  
fresh for frozen section intraoperative consultation. The specimen consists of a  
pink-red ring of bronchus that has dimensions of 3.2 x 2.8 x 0.7 cm.   This 
tissue is submitted for frozen section F. The residual tissue from frozen  
section F is bisected and resubmitted in cassettes F1 and F2.

3. The specimen container labeled with the patient• s name and as ""left 
lower lobe-bronchial resection margin"", contains a lobe of lung that 
measures 15.5 x 14.o·x 5.7 em in formalin-inflated state. The pleura is 
intact, mostly smooth and partly hemorrhagic. On the medial aspect 
adjacent to the bronchus there is ragged soft tissue adhered. On the 
medial anterior aspect extending from the apex to the inferior aspect 
there is a staple line margin measuring 14.0 em long. The bronchial 
resection margin is examined at intraoperative consultation by frozen 
section. On sectioning the lung, there is a central tumor mass present 
measuring 4.7 em in maximum diameter. The mass is solid tan-white with 
some gray-black qtiery segmental lymph nodes admixed. Grossly the tumor 
appears to extend beyond the pleura and into the overlying ragged area of 
soft tissue which is adja.cent to the bronchus. In this area the soft 
tissue is painted with silver nitrate. The tumor invades into the lobar 
bronchus and into the segmental bronchi. The tumor is also 2.0 em away 
from the staple line resection margin. The rest of the lung parenchyma 
ranges from unremarkable to mildly emphysematous with more prominence at 
the apex. Four pieces of tumor and four pieces of grossly normal lung 
'renchyma are taken for tissue banking.

HISTORY 
Adenocarcinoma LV lobe on 
No previous therapy. 
MACROSCOPIC 
Four speCImens received. 
1: The specimen is labelled ""L upper lobe"" and consists of an upper lobe measuring 205 x 145 x 40 
mm in the inflated state. Deep to the lateral pleura there is a fIrm white nodule measuring 43 mm in 
maximal dimension. It has a somewhat glistening mucoid cut surface. [Sections taken: bronchial 
resection margin and peribronchial lymph nodes, IA; further lymph nodes, IB; tumour and pleura, IC­
ID; tumour near to hilum, IE; distal tumour with focal obstructive pneumonitis, IF; apical and basal 
portions of lung, 1 G) 
2: The specimen is labelled ""peribronchial lymph node"" and consists ofa piece of tan lymph node 
tissue measuring 19 x 18 x 10 mm. [Bisected and BIT] 
3: The specimen is labelled ""No.5 node"" and consists of a piece offatty tissue containing a blackened 
lymph node and measuring 11 x 7 x 6 mm. [Bisected and BIT] 
4: The specimen is labelled ""No.6 node"" and consists of two pieces of blackened lymph node with 
attached fat. These piece each measure 15 x 11 x 6 mm and 21 x 9 x 8 mm. [Each piece bisected and 
all BIT] 
MICROSCOPIC 
1: Sections show a well-differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma. The tumour has a predominantly 
bronchioloalveolar pattern but there are areas of stromal invasion. In some areas the tumour has a 
papillary architecture. The lesion is subpleural but no pleural invasion is identifIed. Lymphatic 
permeation is present and there is metastatic carcinoma within some of the peribronchial lymph nodes. 
There is no blood vessel inva~ion and no perineural permeation is identified. The lesion is well clear of 
the bronchial resection margin. The adjacent lung shows evidence of emphysema. 
2: The lymph node contains metastatic mucinous adenocarcinoma. 
3: Sections of the lymph nodes show reactive changes only. There is no evidence of malignancy. 
4: Sections of the lymph nodes show reactive changes only. There is no evidence of malignancy. 
SUMMARY 
Left upper lobe lung and lymph nodes: 
1: Well-differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma; 43 mm in maximal dimension. 
2: Lymphatic permeation present but no blood vessel or perineural invasion present. 
3: No pleural invasion identifIed; clear of bronchial margin. 
4: Peribronchial lymph node metastases but no involvement of No 5 and No 6 lymph nodes.

Surgical Pathology 
TISSUE DESCRIPTION:  
 
Tissue from left upper lobe lung (16.5 x 8.5 x 6.5 em), separately 
submitted proximal tracheal margin (2.5 x 1.5 x 1.5 em), separately 
submitted bronchial margin of left upper lobe lung (3.5 x 2.8 x 1.1 
em), separately submitted margin left lower lobe lung (1.4 x 0.7 x 
0.3 em), superior mediastinal (left tracheobronchial), aortic 
(aortopulmonary), inferior (subcarinal) lymph nodes, left lower lobe 
bronchus lymph node, separately submitted margin left lower lobe 
lung (1.4 x 0.7 x 0.3 em) 
DIAGNOSIS: 
Lung, left upper lobe, lobectomy and sleeve resection: Invasive 
grade 3 (of 4) squamous cell carcinoma forms a centrally located 4.5 
x 3.2 x 3.2 em mass. The pleura is uninvolved. The proximal tracheal 
(after re-excision) and distal bronchial margins are negative for 
tumor. Distal lung segments show post obstructive organizing 
pneumonia. 
Lymph nodes, left upper lobe intrapulmonary peribronchial, excision: 
Multiple (3 of 8) intrapulmonary peribronchial lymph nodes are 
involved by metastatic carcinoma. 
Lung, separately submitted left lower lobe margin, excision: Lung 
parenchyma showing organizing pneumonia; negative for tumor. 
Lymph nodes, superior and inferior mediastinal, aortic, excision: 
Multiple superior mediastinal (5 left tracheobronchial), inferior 
mediastinal (1 subcarinal), aortic (2 aortopulmonary) lymph nodes 
are negative for tumor. 
Lymph nodes, left lower lobe bronchus, excision: Multiple (4) left 
lower lobe bronchus lymph nodes are negative for tumor. 
"," 1. ""Site"": Lung. Justification: The report clearly states that the surgical pathology is related to the lung.
2. ""Laterality"": Left. Justification: The report specifies that the left upper lobe and left lower lobe were removed, indicating the laterality as left.
3. ""Histology"": Squamous cell carcinoma. Justification: The report mentions an invasive grade 3 squamous cell carcinoma in the left upper lobe.
4. ""Stage"": Not provided. Justification: Although the report describes the invasion of the tumor, it does not provide enough information to determine the TNM stage accurately.
5. ""Grade"": III. Justification: The report specifies that the tumor is a grade 3 (of 4) squamous cell carcinoma, indicating a high-grade tumor.
6. ""Behavior"": Malignant. Justification: The tumor is identified as an invasive carcinoma, which inherently indicates malignant behavior.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

R upper lobectomy for SCc. 
MACROSCOPIC 
Three specimens received 
1: The specimen is labelled 'right upper lobe' and consists of a lobectomy specimen 
measuring 140 x 120 x 75 mm in its partially inflated state. Two bronchi are present 
at the margin measuring 10 to 12 mm in diameter respectively. Two staple lines are 
also present radiating from the bronchial margin to the periphery. They measure 35 
and 80 mm in length. A large lymph node is present adjacent to the bronchial 
resection margin. The cut surface of the lung shows a central lobulated tumour 
measuring 39 x 32 x 30 mm. The cut surface has areas of necrosis and carbon 
pigment. It appears to overrun several central peribronchial lymph nodes. Numerous 
smaller non-involved peribronchial lymph nodes are also identified. Tumour 
compresses one of the main bronchi towards the hilum. It lies approximately 10 mm 
from the bronchial margin and appears clear of the soft tissue margin. It is 5 mm 
from the nearest pleural surface. The distal lung shows evidence of collapse, 
consolidation and bronchiectasis. There also areas of parenchymal haemorrhage, 
likely iatrogenic. Two 1 to 2 mm t~m nodules are seen within the collapsed zone, 
distal to the tumour. There are also two firm granular areas within the lung 
parenchyma away from the tumour. These range in size from 4 to 5 mm in greatest 
dimension . The residual lung parenchyma shows mild emphysema away from the 
areas of collapse, however this is difficult to assess. [1 A, bronchial resection margin; 
1B-1C, one peribronchial lymph node bisected; 1D-1F, RS tumour and adjacent main 
bronchus; 1 G, RS tumour and closest pleural surface; 1H, peribronchial lymph nodes; 
1 I, RS lung parenchyma distal to tumour; 11, RS two small nodules distal to tumour; 
1K, RS lung parenchyma away from tumour; 1L, two firm granular lesions.] 
2: The specimen is labelled 'number 4 lymph node' and consists of a grey to black 
piece of soft tissue consistent with a node measuring 15 mm in greatest dimension. 
The node has a black to white cut surface. [Trisected, BIT, 2A.] . 
3: The specimen is labelled 'number 5 right side lymph node' and consists ofa grey 
piece of soft tissue consistent with a lymph node measuring 28 mm in greatest 
dimension. The cut surface contains numerous white nodules. [Trisected, BIT, 3A-
MICROSCOPIC 
1: Sections show a moderately to poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma 
which appears to arise from a segmental bronchus close to the hilum and which 
obliterates several segmental bronchi. Tumour involves peribronchial fat at the hilum 
but appears clear of the surgical resection margin. The bronchial resection margin 
shows no evidence of squamous metaplasia or dysplasia. Tumour directly invades 
and appears to replace at lease one peribronchial lymph node. A number of silicotic 
nodules are present within other peribronchial lymph nodes. Several foci of vascular 
invasion are present, including involvement of a major branch of the pulmonary artery 
which contains tumour within its lumen. Definite lymphatic or perineural invasion is 
not identified. Distant lung parenchyma contains dust macules and fibromuscular  scars and shows severe emphysema. There are also vascular changes in keeping with 
organised thrombi distal to the tumour. 
2 & 3: Sections show anthracotic lymph nodes containing a few small silicotic 
nodules but no evidence of metastatic carcinoma. 
SUMMARY 
Right upper lobectomy, no. 4 and no. 5 lymph nodes: 
Squamous cell carcinoma, 39 mm in diameter. 
Vascular invasion present. 
No pleural, lymphatic or perineural invasion identified .

lung,right,adenocarcinoma,T2N0M0,III,malignant,ER-B0BP.pdf,                  ," Report: 
The patient is a 62-year-old male who presented with a right upper lobe lung mass. A CT-guided core biopsy was performed. Histologically, the tumor consists of crowded, atypical cells arranged in solid nests and cords, with focal necrosis and a high mitotic rate (>10/high power field). Immunohistochemical stains show the tumor to be positive for TTF-1 and CK7, consistent with a primary lung adenocarcinoma. The tumor involves the visceral pleura but does not invade the chest wall or diaphragm (T2). No hilar or mediastinal lymph node metastases are identified (N0). There is no evidence of distant metastasis (M0). Based on these findings, the tumor is staged as T2N0M0. The grade of differentiation cannot be assessed due to the absence of architectural features in this limited sample; however, the high mitotic rate suggests a high-grade tumor (Grade III).

1. ""Site"": lung. Justification: The report mentions the patient presenting with a right upper lobe lung mass.
2. ""Laterality"": right. Justification: As stated in the report, the lung mass is located in the right upper lobe.
3. ""Histology"": adenocarcinoma. Justification: The report describes the histological findings as consistent with a primary lung adenocarcinoma.
4. ""Stage"": T2N0M0. Justification: According to the report, the tumor involves the visceral pleura but does not invade the chest wall or diaphragm (T2), and there are no hilar or mediastinal lymph node metastases (N0) or evidence of distant metastasis (M0).
5. ""Grade"": III. Justification: Although architectural features cannot be assessed, the high mitotic rate suggests a high-grade tumor (Grade III), as stated in the report.
6. ""Behavior"": malignant. Justification: The report mentions that this is a lung adenocarcinoma, which inherently behaves in a malignant fashion by invading surrounding tissues and potentially spreading to distant sites.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Note: 
KRAS codon 12/13 mutations are found in approximately 10-30% lung adenocarcinomas and associated with history of 
smoking. The presence of KRAS mutation leads to resistance to EGFR tiir eted therapies (1). EGFR exon 19 and 21 
mutations are present In about 10% of~nd up to 40% In the opulatlon, COmmon in _and 
associated with the clinical response to treatment with EGFR Inhibitors 2). These mutations are mutually exclusive and 
their presence may have prognostic andlor therapeutic Implications (3,4). Clinical studies show high EGFR gene copy 
number by FISH analYSis (amplification) to be associated with favorable clinical benefit (clinical response, stable disease, 
time to progression, and survival) In patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase 
inhibitors, 
Approximately 3% of lung adenocarcinomas within the Asian population have an interslltlal deletion and inversion in 
chromosome 2p resulting in the EML4IALK fusion gene (ALK+) which is sensitive to ALK inhibitors (5,6). The prevalence 
of this abnormality in the Western population is still unknown. Detection of this abnormality is critical for identifying 
patients eligible for therapies that target ALK enzymatic activity. EML41ALK rearrangements are mutually exclusive with 
KRAS and EGFR mutations.

COMMENT; , 
The adenocarcinoma is ?n Interesting one having both moderate and poorly differentiated areas, with the former 
characterized by cells With abundant vacuolated foamy, light eosinophilic cytoplasm surrounding pools of mucin. In 
some areas, psammoma bodies are Identified, and in still other areas zones of solid growth are prominent. In several 
areas, focal squamous differentiation Is seen, however, this comprises only a small percentage of the overall tumor 
«10%) and therefore, we have chosen not to classify this as an adenosquamous carcinoma.

ain diagnosis/diagnoses:  
Locally advanced and evidently primarily peripheral bronchopulmonary, histologically 
mixed, highly mucigenous adenocarcinoma of the left upper lobe of the lung with predominant large-cell and polymorphocellular solid and small acinar component, located in the boundary region of segments 1 and 3. TNM classification pT4 pN2 V1 RX, stage IIIB C 34.1 M 8255/3  
Comment/supplementary remark:   
The tumor is obviously primarily peripheral in location, has focally infiltrated the parie tal 
layer in the region of the pleural adhesion zone located over the tumor and is possibly 
extending in a continuous perivascular sleeve into the hilum of the superior lobe, where it has formed a further relatively large manifestation involving parabronchial lymph nodes. A separate satellite focus can also be found in S3. The central tumor manifestation has infiltrated the pulmonary venous wall and extends at least very close in the fatty tissue to the hilar resection margin. Because of the tangential sect ion, it cannot be definitely decided whether 
the tumor infiltrate found next to the resection surface actually forms the margin, hence RX. A further lymph node metastasis can be found ion sample 3.). The resection margins of bronchus and vessels, the pericardial specimen also removed and the lymph nodes of samples 4.) and 5.) are tumor- free.

Clinical diagnosis and question 
Suspected BC of the right lower lobe segment 8, status post epiglottis carcinoma. 
REPORT ON FINDINGS 
Macroscopy 
1.) Peribronchial lower lobe bronchus: 0.3 em pale section. 
2.) Inflated, fixed right lower lobe measuring 16 x 12 em at the base and up to 18.5 em in length, central 
bronchus resection line located at the bifurcation of B6. Staple suture lines measuring 4.5 and 3.5 em,

with unclear demarcation and patchy blackish pigmentation located in the central region at the bifurcation of 
B8. Narrowing of B8 and its proximal subsegmental branches. Involvement of some blackish pigmented nodes 
up to I .2 em in size by the tumor, one of these at the hilus. Tumor distance from hilar resection surface at least 
0. I em, extends right up to the peripheral pleura. Sleeve-like tumor spread along smaller bronchial branches. 
Peripheral bronchi in segment 8 dilated and filled with thick mucus. Parenchyma in tumor environment 
diffusely indurated in places and of brownish-yellow color. Rest of parenchyma, pleura and prepared bronchial 
pathways inconspicuous. 
1.) Lobar LN (Item 12) middle lobe: 1.2 em lesioned grayish-black node or node part. 
2.) Lobar LN (Item 12) middle lobe: 1.3 em Iesioned grayish-black node or node part. 
3.) Hilar LN (Item 10) right: 2.5 em Iesioned grayish-black node. 
4.) Subcarinal LN (Item 7): two Iesioned grayish-black nodes with some surrounding tissue, 0.6 and 3 em in 
size, the larger one strand-shaped. 
Examined: 
1.) Rapid section residual material, 
2.) Tumor with rest of parenchyma, with subsegmental branches of B8 and involved nodes, tumor margin area with 
sleeve-like spread, hilar resection surface (color marking), 2 sections with peripheral pleura + hilar nodes, central

Microscopy 
1.) Immediate intraoperative evaluation : mainly vessel, marginal very small LN section without 
tumor. 
3.) Immediate intraoperative evaluation ): LN with no carcinoma. 
Description of histological and cytological findings omitted for capacity reasons. 
 EVAlUATION 
Primary diagnosis/diagnoses 
Bronchopulmonary, histologically large-cell solid carcinoma without mucin formation extending from central to 
peripheral areas in the region of the mediastinal pleura. Tumor classification according to this picture pT2 pNl Vl RO, 
stage liB. C343 M8012/3 or 8070/3. 
Secondary diagnosis/diagnoses 
Tumor necrosis. Marked, largely interstitial chronic and predominantly Iymphofollicular inflammation in the 
area of the tumor margin with atypical adenomatous alveolar hyperplasia. Chronic sclerotic peribronchitis of 
downstream subsegmental bronchi and active chronic peripheral bronchitis in S8. Tumor-free lymph nodes with 
moderate anthracotic pigment deposit and reactive follicular hyperplasia. 
Remark/addendum 
The carcinoma lies in 58; it probably developed centrally with partial infiltration and destruction of B8. Medium-sized 
pulmonary arteries are infiltrated by the tumor, focally destroyed and obliterated; there is also a focal tumor infiltration 
of the outer wall of the main branch of the pulmonary artery to the lower lobe. The resection margins of the large 
pulmonary vessels and the bronchus resection line are tumor-free. The lymph node metastases lie in the region of the 
primary tumor and the hilar region. Since histological examination occasionally shows vaguely suggestive differentiation 
or structural features of squamous cell carcinoma, it could also be an undifferentiated squamous cell carcinoma 
(immunohistochemical cytokeratin analysis follows).

Addendum 
The granulomas in the left lower lobe lung specirnen (Part 7) and lelilower lobe bronchial lymph node (Part 9) show small fungal 
yeast forms on the Grocott stain that are negative on the mucicarmine stains. These fungal forms most likely represent 
Histaolasma soecies. Clinical correlation is-suaaested. AF8 stainFii are neaative "," Site: Lung and bronchial lymph node
Laterality: Not provided
Histology: Granulomas with small fungal yeast forms, most likely Histoplasma species
Stage: Not provided
Grade: Not applicable
Behavior: Benign, clinical correlation recommended

Justification: The report specifically mentions the presence of granulomas with small fungal yeast forms in the left lower lobe lung specimen and bronchial lymph node. These forms are most likely Histoplasma species, as stated in the addendum. Granulomas are benign lesions, but clinical correlation is recommended due to the presence of the fungal infection.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gross Description: 
Received are eight formalin filled cont ainers, each labeled with the patient's 
name. 
Part A is additionally labeled ""level 10 lymph node"" and is a specimen 
consisting of multiple tan to brown irregular soft tissue fragments, ranging in size from 0.3 to 0.7 cm. The specimen is submitted in toto in cassette A1.  For 
decalcification.  
 Part B is additionally labeled ""R11 lymph node"" and is a specimen consisting of 
a single tan to dark brown apparent lymph node measuring 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm. The 
specimen is submitted in toto in cassette B1. For decalcification.  
 
Part C is additionally labeled ""R12 lymph node"" and is a specimen consisting of a single yellow lobulated soft tissue fragment, measuring 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm. 
The specimen is submitted in toto in  cassette C.  For decalcification.  
 
Part D is additionally labeled ""R13 lymph node"" and is a specimen consisting of 
a single tan to brown apparent lymph node, measuring 1 x 0.7 x 0.3 cm. The specimen is submitted entirely in ca ssette D1 for de calcification.  
 
Part E is additionally labeled ""right upper lobe"" and is a specimen consisting 
of two cassettes labeled FSE1 and FSE2. Within cassette FSE1 is a fragment of 
tan to brown apparent lung parenchyma measuring 2.2 x 1.9 x 0.2 cm. The specimen is resubmitted in cassette E1 for permanent sections. Within cassette FSE2 is a 
single tan to brown fragment of apparent lung measuring 2.7 x 1.3 x 0.2 cm. The 
specimen is resubmitted in cassette E2 for permanent sectioning. Also within the 
container is a purple to dark brown appa rent right upper lobe measuring 17.5 x 
10 x 5.5 cm. The specimen has been previously incised at the time of frozen sectioning. The bronchial margin and vascular margins are stapled shut. The 
pleural surface of the lung is smooth and glistening. Serial sectioning of the 
lung reveals two to three tan-white infiltrative appearing lesions.  The mass 
that was designated as the smaller lesion (FSE1) at the time of frozen 
sectioning, measures 3.5 x 2.5 x 2.1 cm. It abuts the pleural surface and comes 
to within 2 cm of the bronchial and vascular margins. The mass that was 
designated as the larger lesion at the time of frozen sectioning (FSE2), 
measures 2.5 x 3 x 2 cm. This mass abuts the pleural surface and comes to within 
3 cm of the bronchial and vascular margins. Therefore the mass that was  initially described as the smaller lesion at the time of frozen sectioning was 
found to be the larger of the two masses. The uninvolved parenchyma is red and 
spongy with no discrete lesions.   
 
The specimen is submitted as follows:  
     E3     bronchial margin;       E4     vascular margin;  
     E5-7     3.5 cm mass to nearest pleural surface;  
     E8     3.5 cm mass to  adjacent grossly normal lung;  
     E9-11     2,5 cm mass to nearest pleural surface;       E12     2.5 cm mass to adjacent grossly normal lung;       E13     representativ e section of uninvolved lung;  
     E14     multiple possible lymph nodes in toto.   
Part F is additionally labeled ""level 7 lymph node"" and is a specimen consisting 
of three tan to brown firm fragments of ti ssue, ranging in size from 0.3 to 0.7 
cm. The specimen is submitted in entirely in cassette F1 for decalcification.  
 Part G additionally labeled ""2R lymph node"" and is a specimen consisting of 
three fragments of purple to white irregular soft tissue, ranging in size from 
0.4 to 2.2 cm.    
The specimen is submitted as follows:  
     G1     two smaller fragments submitted in toto;  
     G2     the larger fragment bisected.   Part H is additionally labeled ""4R"" and is a specimen consisting of a single tan 
to white soft tissue fragment that grossly resembles a lymph node and measures 
0.7 x 0.7 x 0.3 cm. The specimen is su bmitted in toto in cassette H1.

fragment of slightly disrupted, red-brown tissue and a 0.1 cm fragment of anthracotic material. The largest
specimen is serially sectioned and combined with the anthracotic material in cassette Fl.
G. The specimen is labeled right upper lobe and is received in formalin. It consists of a lobe of lung which
measures 16 x 5 x 4 cm and has a partially fixed weight of 112 grams. The pleural surfaces vary from pink
to pale red-violet and are smooth. A metallic staple line is present along the medial edge of the hilum of
the lung and a second staple line is present along the medial-anterior surface extending from the apical
portion inferiorly and is 11.5 cm in length. The entire pleural surface is inked blue. At the hilum, the
bronchial margin is identified and removed as a thin shave for frozen section as BFS. There are
approximately six dark brown anthracotic peribronchial nodes. Dissection of the bronchi reveal no
intrabronchial tumor. The pulmonary parenchyma is dark red and appears well-aerated and there are no
other palpable masses. The presumed staple line from specimen A above is 2 cm from the closest

COMMENT: 
This case in addition to invasive moderately differentiated adenoccareinoma demonstrates typical carcinoid in the right 
mlddla lobe aSSOCiated with numerous carcinoid turnorlefs and diffuse lieuroendocrine cell hyperplasia. A primary lung 
origin of carcinoid is confinned by positive TTF~1 and synaptophysin immunostalning. CDX2 and calcitonin are negative. 
Surgical resection margin of the right middle lobe demonstrates scattered small microscopic foci of neuroendocrine 
cells. However, based on the gross description it seems that margin is negative for tumor and these neuroendocrine 
cells may represent another focus of tumorlet

ROSS DESCRIPTION:
Specimen A is received in the fresh state labeled ""left lower lobe lung"". This is a lobe
of lung recognizable as lower lobe and measuring 11 x 10 x 6 cm. The pleural surfaces are
smooth, dark reddish-tan to black. At the base of the lobe is a firm tumor. The overlying
pleura is smooth and this surface is inked black. The cut surface of the tumor shows
solid white tissue with the appearance of confluent nodules, forming a multinodular
single mass which measures 2.5 x 2.0 cm in greatest surface area. Tumorous tissue focally
extends to within 1 mm of the inked pleural surface at the base of the lobe. A portion of
the tumor is harvested for tumor banking. The tumor is 2 cm from the bronchial margin.
There is a blackened 8 mm peribronchial lymph node. Serial sections through the remainder
of the lung tissue reveal no additional tumors. Representative sections are submitted as
follows:
Al-bronchial and vascular margin
A2-peribronchial lymph node at margin
A3-6 - tumor
A7-uninvolved lung
AS-additional bronchi adjacent to tumor but uninvolved
Specimen B is received in formalin labeled ""left level 8 lymph node"". This is an ovoid
piece of firm dark reddish-brown to white tissue measuring 1.3 x 1.3 x 0.7 cm. The cut
surface is solid homogeneous white, suspicious for metastasis. The specimen is entirely
submitted in cassette B1 and B2.
Specimen C is received in formalin labeled ""left level 11 lymph node"". It consists of
multiple irregular pieces of dark reddish-brown tissue measuring 10 x 8 x 3 mm in
aggregate. The specimen is entirely submitted in cassette C1.
MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
A.Sections of the lung tumor demonstrate a well to moderately differentiated
adenocarcinoma with a mixed glandular, solid and papillary growth pattern. Areas of clear

    appears to have encased the bronchus at the point  of resection.  
    This node, on cut section is 2.5 cm in greatest extent and has a  
    mottled tan and black cut surface.  There is an area of pleural  
    thickening and puckering on the apical portion of the lobectomy.  
    Serial sections taken through the lung reveal a large discrete  
    circumscribed tumor in the apex measuring 2.3 x 1.9 x 1.5 cm.  It 
    too has a granular tan and black cut surface appearance and is  
    sharply demarcated from the surrounding lung. It approaches the  
    visceral pleural surface but does not appear to involve it.  
    Adjacent to tumor there is an area of discoloration and thickening  
    of the lung parenchyma as well as some apparent emphysematous  
    changes in the more distal parenchyma.  Portion of tumor and normal  
    tissue submitted for tissue procurement per request of the surgeon.

 MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION  
             Microscopic sections of the lung carcinoma reveals a poorly     differentiated non -small cell carcinoma.  The tumor is growing in  
    discrete  nodules and packets filling the air space s with somewhat  
    columnar cells with a peripheral picket -fence -like pattern of  
    growth.  Individual cells are hyperchromatic with frequent mitotic  
    activity.  The tumor is negative for mucicarmine.  It does show     strong positivity for TTF -1 and  CEA and is negative for P63.  This  
  
 
indicates that it is a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.  
    Results of the resection are summarized in the following template.  
 
    Histologic type:  Adenocarcinoma.  
    Histologic  grade:  Poorly differentiated. 
    Primary tumor (pT):  Tumor is 2.3 cm in size and not involve the  
    visceral pleural surface (pT1b).  
    Margins of resection:  Negative.

REPORT ON FINDINGS 
Macroscopy 
!.) Upper lobe: inflated, fixed left upper lobe measuring 19 x 17 x 6 em, central bronchus resection plane 
located 0.4 em proximal to the bifurcation of the bronchus to the apical bronchi. A staple suture line runs from 
the hilus in a cranial direction for 6 em and in a dorsal direction for 6.5 em. At the hilus two nodes, 1.4 em and 
2.5 em in size. Visceral pleura shows partly patchy and partly reticulate blackish pigmentation, in S3 a 
paracentral irregularly protruding area of about 5 em. Under this a moderately firm, pale brown to whitish, in 
parts pale yellowish, softened tumor, max. 5.2 em in size, with an arcuate configuration, almost completely 
obstructing B3 with endobronchial growth extending to within 0.1 em of the bifurcation ofB3. The parenchyma 
surrounding the tumor is partly vitreous, partly compacted and yellow brownish. Rest of parenchyma relatively 
marked patches of blackish pigmentation. 
2.) Lobar LN (station 12) lingula: 2.3 em node. 
3.) Interlobar LN (station 11): 1 em node. 
4.) Hilar LN (station 10) left: two nodes, 1.8 and 2 em in size. 
5.) Paraesophageal LN (station 8) left: 1.5 em node. 
6.) Low paratracheal LN (station 4) left: 0.3 em node with abundant surrounding tissue. 
7.) Prevascular and retrotracheal LN (station 3) left: 1.4 em node with surrounding tissue. 
8.) High paratracheal LN (station 2) left: 1,3 em node with some surrounding tissue. 
9.) Subcarinal LN (station 7): 2.5 em node with some surrounding tissue.

 EVALUATION 
Primary diagnosis/diagnoses: Central to paracentral, peripheral bronchopulmonary, histologically poorly 
differentiated, large-cell and polyrnorphocellular, focal gigantocellular, nonkeratinizing squamous cell 
carcinoma of the left lower lobe of the lung with a small differentiated glandular component, focal mucin 
inclusions and localization in 83. 
TNM classification according to this picture pT2 pNO pMX RO, stage IB. 
C 34.1, M 8070/3. 
Secondary diagnosis/diagnoses: Active chronic retention pneumonia in the tumor environment (sample !.)), 
lymph nodes with reactive lesions and anthracotic pigment deposits (samples 1.) to 12.)). 
Remark/addendum: The carcinoma has infiltrated the paracentral visceral pleura enlarged by fibrosis and 
extends with endobronchial growth to within the immediate vicinity of the bifurcation ofB3. The finding is not 
sufficient for the diagnosis of an adenosquamous carcinoma. The resection margin of the bronchus and vessels 
and all excised and identified lymph nodes are tumor-free. "," 1. ""Site"": Left upper lobe - as the report clearly specifies the tumor location in the left upper lobe.

The larger fragment measures 0.9 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm and the smaller fragment measures 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm. Microscopic description: The tumor is composed of cells arranged in cords and nests, with focal comedo necrosis. The tumor cells have high nucleus to cytoplasm ratio, vesicular chromatin, and conspicuous nucleoli. Mitotic figures are easily identified. Immunohistochemical stains show the tumor cells to be positive for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2 neu. The background shows extensive lymphocytic infiltration. No ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or invasive carcinoma is identified in the surrounding breast tissue.

MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:  
The specimen is received in six parts, each labeled with the  
patient's name.  
 1. Part one is received in saline, labeled 'level 9 lymph node'. It  
consists of two irregular fragments of tan soft tissue measuring 0.8  
x 0.5 x 0.2 cm and 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm. Entirely submitted in one  
cassette.  
 2. Part two is received fresh, labeled 'right upper lobectomy'. It  
consists of a  portion of right upper lobe of lung, measuring 15.6 x  
3.8 cm. The staple line measures 15.5 cm. The staple line is shaved  
and the pleura around the staple line is inked in green. The pleural  
surface is pink tan glistening and reveals a thickened, bossellated  
area with fibrous thickening. The bronchial margin measures 1.5 cm  
and the vascular margin 1.2 cm. Beneath the thickened pleura there  
is a firm gray area, measuring 1.5 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm, located 4.5 cm  
from the staple line margin. Also noted a second separate firm gray  
white area, measuring 1.5 cm in greatest dimension which upon  
pressure exudes cheesy material. This mass is located 1 cm from the staple line margin, also multiple anthracotic lymph nodes, ranging  
from 0.2 cm to 0.5 cm identified from the hilar area. Representative  
sections are submitted.  
 3. Part three is received in saline, labeled 'level 7 lymph node'.  
It consists of three irregular fragments of tan soft tissue 
measuring 1.5 x 0.7 x 0.3 cm, 1.5 x 1 x 0.2 cm and 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.2  
cm. Entirel y submitted in two cassettes.  
 
4. Part four is received in saline, labeled 'level 4 lymph node'.  
It consists of a 0.7 x 0.4 x 0.1 cm irregular portion of tan soft  
tissue. Entirely submitted in one cassette.  
  
5. Part five is received in saline, labeled 'additional right upper  
lobe margin'. It consists of a 6.5 x 4.5 x 2.5 cm triangular -shaped  
wedge of lung tissue, with a 6.5 cm long stapled line along one  
edge, and two stapled lines along an adjacent edge measuring 3 cm  
and 4 cm respectively. The specimen is  photographed. The 6.5 cm  
long stapled edge is inked black; the 3 cm long stapled edge  
(adjacent to the 6.5cm long one) is inked blue; and the 4 cm long 
stapled edge is inked green. The black and blue inked stapled lines  
are at acute angles. The staples are trimmed off and the specimen  
is serially sectioned, revealing no focal lesions or masses.  
Representative sections are submitted.  
 6. Part six is received in formalin, labeled 'rib'. It consists of  
a 1.4 x 1.4 x 0.6 cm segment of rib with red marrow. Enti re 
specimen is submitted in one cassette, after decalcification.

RESULTS: Positive for a p.G12C (c.34G>T) mutation in codon 12 of  
the KRAS gene.  
 INTERPRETATION: Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to  
correlate with poor prognosis and resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibito r therapies in patients with non- small lung cancer.  
 COMMENT:  
KRAS mutations occur in 15- 30% of non- small- cell lung cancer (NSCLC)  
patients and are strongly associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking 
 history.  
 
This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;  
based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are  
expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of  
the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low  
percentage of cells may not be detected.  
 
This test is validated for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and  
codon 13 mutations in fresh, frozen, or formalin- fixed paraffin 
embedded tissue. In particular the test performance has been  
established in samples of colorectal cancer and non- small cell lu ng 
carcinoma which harbor these mutations, although several other  
tissues are also known to harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of  
pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix, etc.).  
 
METHOD/LIMITATION:  
Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is  
selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified  
and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to 
exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single  
nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;  
primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel  
electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or  
negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants  
or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

  ADDENDUM  #1: 
 EGFR Mutation Analysis  
 Genzyme Specimen #  
Referring Physician:  
Body Site: Lung  
Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma  
 RESULTS: No mutation detected  
 INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified; however 18- 20% of  
patients with non-small- cell lung cancer and without identifiable  
mutations are reported to be responsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase  
inhibitor therapies.  
  COMMENT: This assay analyzes exons 18- 21 of the EGFR tyrosine  
kinase domain; based on the current literature, the vast majority of  
mutations are expected to occur in these exons. The analytical  
sensitivity of the assay is 10- 20%, thus mutations present in a low  
percentage of cells may not be detected.  
 
Most data published to date pertain to gefitinib (  
Simila r data have been seen in studies using erlotinib (Tarceva(r)).  
 
This test is validated for non- small cell lung carcinoma. The 
clinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types  
is unknown.  
 METHOD/LIMITATION: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is  
selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the samples, quantified  
and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to 
 exons 18- 21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by  
bi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary electrophoresis  
and fluorescence detection. False positive or negative results may  
occur for reasons that include genetic variants or somatic

GROSS DESCRIPTION: 
A. LEFT LOWER LUNG LOBE 
Received fresh in a single container labelled designated ""left lower lobe 
completion"" and consists of a single lobe The pleural surface ranges 
from tan red to black red and is rough with adhesions. The bronchial margin is removed and 
submitted en face in a single block labelled FSAI for frozen section diagnosis. A large mass is 
palpable within the lung tissue and the pleura overlying this mass is inked black. The specimen 
is serially sectioned and an irregularly shaped tan yellow soft to focally firm tumor measuring 
6.0x3.4x2.5cm. is identified. This tumor abuts the pleura focally in several places but does not 
appear to grossly invade through the pleura. One of the places where it is closes to the pleura is 
 directly adjacent to the bronchial margin. The bulk of the tumor is 0.7cm. away from the nearest 
portion of the bronchial margin. Another smaller similar appearing tumor measuring 1.4cm. in 
diameter is noted approximately 0.5cm. away fi·om the larger tumor. One anthracotic level II and 
one anthracotic level 12 peribronchial lymph node are identified. The bronchi are opened distally 
fi·om the bronchial margin and the bronchial mucosa is uniformly tan without masses or lesions. 
The tumors do not grossly appear to arise from any major bronchus. The remainder of the cut 
surfaces are composed of tan red poorly aerated lung tissue. Representative portions of both 
normal appeming lung tissue and tumor are submitted to tissue procurement. Representative 
portions of the specimen are submitted per the code of sections.

Received fresh is a 109 gram lobe of left lung, measuring 15.0 em from 
apex to base, 13.0 em anterior to posterior, 3.0 em transversely. The pleural 
surface is pink-purple, and has been previously inked black during pathology 
consultation. The hilar aspect of the specimen has been inked blue and is 
remarkable for multiple silver-colored metallic staples. At the hilum is a 
portion of bronchus, measuring 1.0 x 1.0 em. The staple line measures 4.0 em 
in length. The bronchus is now shaved. The margin of the pulmonary vessels 
are also inked blue and are also now shaved. The pulmonary vessels and 
bronchus are open and reveal unremarkable yellow-tan internal surfaces that 
are unobstructed. The lung has been previously transected at the base of the 
bronchus and is remarkable for a well-demarcated ovoid tan-gray indurated mass 
that has overall dimensions of 2.0 x 1.0 x 0.7 em. The mass is present 4.0 em 
from the bronchial margin and pulmonary vessel margins and 1.0 em from the 
closest pleural surface in the mid portion of the specimen. The remainder of 
the lung is sectioned ·and the lung parenchyma at the apex shows marked 
congestion. The lung parenchyma at the base is pink-tan and aerated. 
Additional masses are not identified nor palpated. Representative sections.

Microscopic Description: 
    Sections of the lung tumor reveals a poorly differentiated 
non-small cell carcinoma.  The tumor does not have any well formed 
glands or areas of keratinization.  Immunohistochemistry reveals 
positive staining for both CEA and TTF- 1 with a negative result for CK 
5/6 and P63.  This pattern of staining is indicative of a 
adenocarcinoma.  Results of the resection as summarized in the 
following template - 
 
Histologic type: Adenocarcinoma 
Histologic grade: Poorly differentiated 
Primary tumor (pT): Tumor has extended from the lung through the chest 
wall into the soft tissue adjacent to ribs (pT3). 
Margins of resection: Negative 
Direct extension of tumor: Direct extension into the chest wall is 
present. 
Venous (large vessel) invasion: Positive 
Arterial (large vessel) invasion: Negative 
  
Lymphatic (small vessel) invasion:  Negative 
Regional lymph nodes (pN): All of the hilar lymph nodes and sampled 
mediastinal lymph nodes are negative for metastatic carcinoma (pN0). 
Distant metastasis (pM):  pMx 
Other findings: All the lymph nodes containing non- necrotizing 
granulomatous lymphadenitis.  Special stains for acid- fast and fungal 
organisms are both negative.

Gross Description 
A.  Received fresh labeled ""right upper lobe with chest wall"" is a 308 
g, 18.0 x 11.0 x 4.5 cm lobectomy specimen with attached 1.5 cm in 
length, 1.5 x 1.5 cm in diameter bronchial stump.  Several soft 
gray-black perihilar lymph nodes measuring up to 2.4 cm are recovered. 
A 19 cm staple line traverses the pleura (subsequently removed).  Three 
ribs spanning an area of 9.8 x 5.8 cm are present along one aspect. 
The pleura is smooth to scaberous tan red with a subjacent induration 
adjacent to the adherent ribs.  The pleura overlying the induration is 
inked orange.  The external surface of the ribs is inked blue.  On 
sectioning, there is a 5.5 x 4.7 x 3.5 cm rubbery tan- white to 
gray-black tumor mass subjacent to the adherent ribs.  The tumor 
appears to extend into the intercostal muscles and to within 0.1 cm of 
the inked pleural surface.  A portion of tumor and a portion of normal 
parenchyma are submitted for tissue procurement as requested.  The 
remaining parenchyma is spongy form tan- red without additional mass 
lesion.  Diffuse crepitance is present in the vicinity of the tumor 
mass.  In addition, a rubbery 1.4 cm greatest imension tan- white 
nodule is noted within the adherent pleura.   
Summary: 1 - bronchial margin, 2 - vascular m gins, 3 and 4 - tumor to 
inked pleural surface, 5 and 6 - tumor to intercostal muscle, 7 and 8 - 
random tumor, 9 - random parenchyma, 10 - bisected pleural nodule, 
early 11 - 4 hilar lymph nodes, 12 and 13 - bisected largest hilar 
lymph node, 14 through 18 - tumor to rib following fixation and

Examination report 
Macroscopic findings: 
I. (a-f) Right upper lobe of lung: pulmonary lobe weighing 287 g and measuring 180 x 120 x 60 mm with 
bronchus removed close to the parenchyma. Adhesions on the exterior. On the costal side, deformed parietal 
pleura containing adipose tissue. In the apical section of S 1 there is a tumorous node measuring 65 mm, 
grayish-white, containing significant anthracotic pigment, with a well demarcated border and polycyclic 
demarcation, extending up to and under the adhered pleura. The bronchia are free of tumors in their central 
branches and are unremarkable. The right middle puhnonary lobe is also unremarkable. No larger lymph nodes 
are detectable either in the hilar or peribronchial areas. 
2. L 4: Torn lymph node tissue with anthracotic pigment, measuring around 10 mm. 
3. L 10: Nodule measuring 3 mm with blackish pigment. 
4. L 7: segmented lymph adipose tissue, with partial black pigmentation, measuring approx 20 mm when 
spread out flat. 
5. (a-b) L 4: segmented lymph adipose tissue, measuring approx 20 mm when spread out flat, likewise with 
partial black pigmentation; one of the lymph nodes has a suspicious grayish-white border. 
6. (a-b) L 3: segmented lymph adipose tissue, with partial black pigmentation, measuring approx 20 mm when 
spread out flat. 
Microscopic findings: 
I. (HE, b: PAS, b -e: EvG) No signs of tumor in the resection margin of the bronchia or the adipose 
connective tissue and blood vessels by it. In the peribronchial area there is a small tumor-free lymph node with 
anthracotic pigment. The described tumor is made up of bands of an immature, squamous cell carcinoma with 
distinct pleomorphism and chromatin coarsening of the core as well as frequent mitosis and multi focal necrotic 
inclusions. Infiltration of the visceral pleura, penetrating the adjoining adhesion area, however the clearly 
defmable parietal pleura and the adjoining, adhered, subpleural adipose connective tissue have no further 
tumorous branches. Significant indication of angioinvasion in the centre of the tumor with formation of 
obliterative tumor thrombi. 
2. (HE) Further, tumor-free lymph nodes with histiocytosis, cicatrisation and significant anthracotic pigment 
deposition. 
3. (HE) similar to 2. 
4. (HE) similar to 2. 
5. (HE) similar to 2. Follicle with activated, large genninal centre with nuclear detritus macrophages. 
6. (HE) similar to 2. 
Diagnosis: Resected right superior pulmonary lobe with poorly differentiated and non-keratinizing, maturing 
squamous cell carcinoma, measuring a maximum of 65 mm, with the main tumor mass in S 1 with infiltration 
of the visceral pleura and, in the perifocal section, inflamed and scarred adherent cusp of parietal pleura with 
subpleural adipose tissue, without tumorous branches. Multifocally, angioinvasion in the centre of the tumor 
with vascular tumor tlu·ombi; the bronchial resection margin as well as the peribronchial lymph nodes are 
tumor-free, the latter with anthracosis. All further lymph nodes are tumor-free with varying degrees of distinct 
anthracosis.

GROSS DESCRIPTION 
             A. Received fresh in a single container labelled with the 
             patient's name, medical record number and ""right upper 
    lobe"" is a single lobe of lung parenchyma that weighs 145.2 grams 
    and measures 16.8 x 7.5 x 2.7 cm. in greatest dimensions.  A staple 
    line is present along the medial aspect of the specimen that 
    measures 12.8 cm. in length.  The nodule is palpated in the 
    parenchyma that measures 2.1 x 1.7 x 1.8 cm. in greatest dimensions. 
    The pleural surface overlying this nodule is attenuated with some 
    evidence of retraction.  The pleural surface overlying this area is 
    inked black.  The specimen is sectioned through the tumor. 
    Representative tumor and surrounding normal tissue are submitted for 
    tissue procurement.  Additional representative sections are taken 
    through the specimen.  The cut surfaces show no additional mass 
    lesions with the exception of the tumor described above. 
    Representative sections were taken for histology according to the 
    block summary:  The block summary will be dictated later.  Two extra 
    specimens are received. 
             B. Lymph node, station 7.  Received is a single fragment of 
             gray- tan tissue that measures 1.5 cm. in diameter.  This 
    specimen is bisected and entirely submitted in block B. 
             C. Station 9 lymph node.  Received fresh in a single 
             container labelled with the patient's name, medical record 
    number and ""station 9 lymph node"" are multiple fragments of 
    yellow- orange fatty tissue that contain several lymph nodes.  These 
    lymph nodes are entirely submitted in blocks C1 and C2. 
 
     
 
MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION 
             A.  The sections of the mass lesion in the right upper lobe 
             of the lung shows a non- keratinizing poorly differentiated 
    squamous cell carcinoma, as described in the template below: 
 
    Histologic type:  Non- keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma. 
    Histologic grade:  G3, poorly differeniated. 
    Primary tumor (pT):  pT1;2.1 x 1.7 x 1.8 cm in greatest dimensions. 
    Margins of resection:  The parenchymal, pleural, and bronchial 
    margins are free of tumor. 
    Direct extension of tumor:  Not identified. 
    Venous (large vessel) invasion:  Not identified. 
    Arterial (large vessel) invasion:  Not identified. 
    Lymphatic (small vessel) invasion:  Not identified. 
    Regional lymph nodes (pN):  pN 0.  No tumor is identified in a total 
    of eight (0/8) lymph nodes in parts A, B and C combined. 
  
    Distant metastasis (pM):  Mx. 
    Other findings:  The tumor is well circumscribed from the 
    surrounding non- neoplastic pulmonary parenchyma and does not involve 
      the overlying pleura at all.  Two hilar lymph nodes are identified 
      on the lobectomy specimen.  No tumor is seen within the hilar 
      lymph nodes (0/2). 
 
             B.  A single lymph node is present designated as ""station 
             7"".  No tumor is seen within this lymph node (0/1). 
             C.  A total of five lymph nodes are identified in the 
             station 9 specimen.  No tumor is seen within these five 
    lymph nodes (0/5). 
 
    5,3x2 
 
DIAGNOSIS 
    A.  Lung, right upper lobe, lobectomy: 
          Poorly differentiated non- keratinizing squamous cell 
          carcinoma; margins free of tumor (see report). 
          No tumor seen in two lymph nodes (0/2). 
    B.  Station 7 lymph nodes, removal: 
          No tumor is seen in one lymph node (0/1). 
    C.  Station 9 lymph nodes, removal: 
          No tumor is seen in five lymph nodes (0/5).

The sample consists of a fragment of soft tissue measuring 3.5 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm. Microscopic examination reveals features consistent with a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST), WHO Grade III. No specific sites of origin are identified, but the lesion is abutting and possibly arising from a nerve bundle. There is no evidence of residual schwannoma or neurofibroma within this sample. The specimen shows focal areas of tumor necrosis. Mitotic activity is brisk (>10 mitoses/10 high power fields). Surgical margins are widely involved by the tumor. No lymphovascular invasion is identified.

Other Pathologists / PAs:
FS:Right middle and right lower lobes:
Stapled margin: Negative for tumor (3.0 mm from the tumor).
Bronchial margin: Negative for tumor.
Tumor: Adenocarcinoma (6.5 cm).
Dictated by:
The specimen is received fresh for frozen section labeled with the
patient's name, and is designated ""right middle
and right lower lobes."" T e specimen consists of a grossly
recognizable segment of lung weighing 538.2 gm and measuring 21.0 x
16.5 x 4.6 cm. Two lobes of lung are grossly recognizable and are the
middle and lower lobes respectively. There is a tumor palpable in
the lower lobe measuring approximately 6.5 x 5.0 x 4.5 cm. The
pleural surface is red-purple and smooth without noted areas of
puckering. The surface is also notable for two staple lines; a 6.0 cm
staple line in the middle lobe which is approximately 5.0 cm from the
nearest palpable massand a 9.0 cm staple line adjacent to the tumor.
The staple lines are removed and the underlying lung parenchyma is
inked orange. The bronchial and vascular margins are shaved. The
bronchi are notable for white-tan tumor in the lumen of the bronchi.
The tumor appears grossly at the shaved bronchial margin. The lung is
serially sectioned to reveal a large multinodular and confluent
white-tan solid and partially necrotic tumor. This large tumor
grossly involves the central and peripheral aspects of the lung lobe.
The tumor grossly approaches the pleural margin and is less than 1.0
mm grossly from the nearest pleural surface. The nearest staple line
is also closely involved by tumor and is grossly 3.0 mm from the
nearest stapled margin. One representative section of tumor adjacent
to the nearest staple margin and one representative section of the
bronchial margin are submitted for frozen section. Representative
sections of the tumor next to the nearest pleural surfacr and next to
(Continued on next page.) Page 7
the nearest bronchi are submitted. The entire staple lines are
submitted. The hilum reveals three possible lymph nodes ranging in
size from 0.3 to 0.8 cm in greatest dimension. These lymph nodes are
entirely submitted.

Clinical diagnosis and question 
Squamous cell carcinoma of the right upper lobe. 
REPORT ON FINDINGS 
Macroscopy 
1.) Right upper lobe: inflated, fixed right upper puhnonary lobe measuring 18 x 12 x 4 em, central bronchus 
resection plane located 0. I em proximal to the bifurcation into the segmental bronchi. At the hilus a 2 em node. 
A staple suture line runs from the hilus in a caudoventral direction for 10 em. Visceral pleura, especially in the 
lateral region, shows slightly reticulate blackish pigmentation. In S2 and 3, at the boundary to Sl a firm, pale 
gray tumor, max. 2.8 em in size, with central patchy blackish pigmentation and unclear, in pa1ts vaguely arcuate 
demarcation. Distance from visceral pleura 0.5 em. Subsegmental branches of B2 and B3 leading into the 
tumor. Rest of parenchyma accentuated in SI showing rarefaction with formation oflacunae of max. 1 em. 
2.) Lobar LN (station 12) lower lobe: 0.7 em node. 
3.) Hilar LN (station 10) right: 0.7 em node with surrounding tissue. 
4.) Low paratracheal LN (station 4) right: 0.8 em Iesioned node and a 0.5 em node with abundant surrounding 
tissue. 
5.) Subcarinal LN (station 7): 1.6 em Iesioned node or node part with some surrounding tissue.

Description of histological and cytological findings omitted for capacity reasons. 
EVALUATION 
Primary diagnosis/diagnoses: 
Intennediate bronchopuhnonary, histologically poorly differentiated, large-cell, focal gigantocellular, 
nonkeratinizing squamous cell carcinoma of the right upper lobe of the lung located in the boundary region of 
S2 and 3. 
TNM classification according to this picture pTl pNO pMX RO, stage IA. C 34.1, M 8070/3. 
Secondary diagnosis/diagnoses: 
Marked focal centroacinar pulmonary emphysema (sample 1.)). Lymph nodes with reactive lesions and 
anthracotic pigment deposits (samples 1.) to 5.)). 
 Remark/addendum: 
The carcinoma has evidently grown partly into the alveolar septa and in many places is covered by the 
preserved hyperplastic alveolar epithelium, possibly as a result of this there are evidently extracellular 
accumulations of mucus in the tumor and between the tumor cell structures, in the sense of mucus retention, 
without any unequivocal mucin fonnation discernible in the tumor. The visceral pleura, resection margin of the 
bronchus and vessels and all excised lymph nodes are tumor-free. "," 1. ""Site"": Right upper lobe - as mentioned in the first line of the report.
2. ""Laterality"": Right - as stated in the second line of the report.
3. ""Histology"": Nonkeratinizing squamous cell carcinoma, large-cell, focally gigantocellular - as described in the primary diagnosis.
4. ""Stage"": T1 (tumor invades no more than the layer of lung in which it developed) N0 (no regional lymph node metastasis) M0 (no distant metastasis) - as per the TNM classification in the report. However, the exact stage is not explicitly provided and needs to be interpreted from the TNM classification.
5. ""Grade"": Not provided - The report does not mention the grade of differentiation for this tumor.
6. ""Behavior"": Malignant - Given that it's a type of cancer, the behavior is inherently malignant.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMED WIT,.
THE SPECIMEN IS RECEIVED FOR FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS, LABELED WITH
THE PATIENT'S NAME, AND DESIGNATED RIGHT UPPER LOBE
AND RIGHT LOWER LOBE SUPERIOR SEGMENT. THE SPECIMEN CONSISTS OF A
449 GM RIGHT SUPERIOR LOBECTOMY AND RIGHT INFERIOR LOBE WEDGE
RESECTION MEASURING 20.0 X 15.0 X 7.0 CM. THE PLEURAL SURFACE
APPEARS SOMEWHAT MOTTLED. TWO AREAS OF THE PLEURAL APPEAR PUCKERED
(1.8 CM AND 2.0 CM IN GREATEST DIMENSION). THESE AREAS HAVE BEEN
INKED BLACK AND REPRESENTATIVE SECTIONS MOST CONCERNING FOR PLEURAL
INVOLVEMENT BY TUMOR SUBMITTED. TWO STAPLE LINES ARE PRESENT IN THE
LUNG; THE FIRST MEASURING 12.0 CM, SUPERIOR TO INFERIOR, ALONG THE
POSTERIOR ASPECT OF THE RIGHT SUPERIOR LOBE; THE SECOND STAPLE LINE
IS 9.0 CM, LATERAL TO MEDIAL, ALONG THE POSTERIOR ASPECT OF THE RIGHT
INFERIOR LOBE. THESE STAPLE LINES ARE CAREFULLY REMOVED AND THE
UNDERLYING LUNG PARENCHYMA INKED ORANGE. THREE LARGE VESSELS THAT
HAVE BEEN STAPLED CLOSED ARE IDENTIFIED AT THE HILUM OF THE LUNG. THE
STAPLES ARE REMOVED AND SHAVE SECTIONS ARE SUBITTED OF EACH VESSEL.
THE RIGHT MAIN BRONCHUS AND BRONCHUS INTERMEDIUS ARE IDENTIFIED AND
SHAVE MARGINS OF EACH ARE SUBMITTED FOR FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSES. A
PERPENDICULAR SECTION OF THE RIGHT INFERIOR LOBE AT THE STAPLE LINE
IN RELATION TO TUMOR WAS ALSO SUBMITTED FOR FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS.
THE SPECIMEN IS THEN SECTIONED ALONG THE AXIS OF THE MAJOR AIRWAYS TO
REVEAL A 4.5 CM MASS THAT GROSSLY APPEARS TO ARISE FROM THE RIGHT
SUPERIOR LOBE ADJACENT TO LARGE AIRWAYS. THE MASS IS 2.2 FROM THE
(Continued on next page.) VASCULAR MARGINS AND 1.5 CM FROM THE CLOSEST ASPECT OF THE BRONCHIAL
MARGINS. MULTIPLE ENLARGED HILAR LYMPH NODES ARE IDENTIFIED RANGING
IN SIZE FROM 0.5 CM TO 1.8 CM AND WERE SUBMITTED. THE SPECIMEN WAS
NEXT SECTIONED ALONG THE AXIS OF MAJOR AIRWAYS NOT IN PROXIMITY TO
THE MASS AND AWAY FROM THE MASS. REPRESENTATIVE SECTION OF THESE
UNINVOLVED AIRWAYS WERE SUBMITTED. THE MASS AND SURROUNDING LUNG
TISSUE WAS THENSERIALLLY SECTIONED IN THE TRANSVERSE PLAIN FROM
SUPERIOR TO INFERIOR TO REVEAL THAT THE TUMOR APPEARS TO EXTEND FROM
THE RIGHT SUPERIOR LOBE INTO THE RIGHT INFERIOR LOBE. SERIAL
SECTIONING THROUGH THE REMAINING LUNG TISSUE IDENTIFIES A REGION
SUSPICIOUS OF TUMOR INVASION TOWARDS THE LUNG PLEURA. HOWEVER, THE
TUMOR APPEARS GROSSLY TO BE CONTAINED WITHIN THE VISCERAL PLEURA.
REPRESENTATIVE SECTIONS OF THE TWO SEPERATE AREAS SUSPICOUS FOR TUMOR

L.Right upper lobe, lobectomy: Lobe of lung with 2 distinct
carcinomas. The smaller (pTlb) is a squamous cell carcinoma confined
to the parenchyma with negative pleura and margins of resection. The
larger tumor (pT2b) is a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma which
spares the pleura but is identified at the parenchymal margin once the
staple line was trimmed away.
Multiple calcified hyalinized granulomata also present. 4 additional
lymph nodes negative for metastatic disease. Marked fibro-inflammatory
reaction beyond the tumor and adherent to 2 ribs.
M.AVF node, biopsy: Benign lung tissue with single calcified
hyalinized granuloma.
N.4R, biopsy: Benign lymphoid tissue with anthracosis
0.Level 9, biopsy: Benign lymphoid tissue with anthracosis
P.level 7, biopsy: Benign lymphoid tissue with anthracosis.
Microscopic Description:
Microscopic examination performed. All lymphoid tissue submitted is
negative for metastatic disease but discloses significant anthracosis.
Scattered hyalinized and calcified granulomata are noted in parts F.,
L.and M which on H&E stain suggested the possibility of fungal
organisms. However, GMS stain for fungus was performed on part F.,
blocks L 9-11 and M and were all negative. No definite fungal
organisms, therefore, are identified. The stain for acid-fast bacilli
these blocks is negative. The right upper lobe specimen, part L, discloses two separate
carcinomas. The smaller one (2.5 cm) is a squamous cell carcinoma with
involvement of a nearby bronchus which also contains squamous cell
carcinoma in situ. This tumor has focal keratinization and necrosis,
sparing the pleura 1.5 cm away from this tumor is a 6.5 cm cavitating
moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. There is no apparent
communication or commingling of these tumor types. The periphery of
the invasive adenocarcinoma discloses bronchoalveolar architecture.
The 2 densely adherent ribs overlie the vicinity of the adenocarcinoma.
The adenocarcinoma appears confined to the pulmonary parenchyma.
Distal to the adenocarcinoma there is a marked fibro-inflammatory
response (containing occasional giant cells) which replaces the pleura
and extends to the surface of the ribs. There is no actual tumor in
this thick fibro-inflammatory layer and the ribs are negative for
tumor. Bronchial and vascular margins of resection are negative for
tumor. However, the staple line was trimmed away and the remaining
parenchymal surface painted with ink. Bronchoalveolar type carcinoma
extends to this ink. Please see the template below with each tumor be
considered separately. The 1st template pertains to the smaller,
squamous cell cancer; the 2nd template the os with the larger,
adenocarcinoma.
Histologic type: Squamous cell carcinoma
Histologic grade: Moderately differentiated
Primary tumor (pT): pTlb
Margins of resection: Negative
Direct extension of tumor: Negative
Venous (large vessel) invasion: Negative
Arterial (large vessel) invasion: Negative

The sample consists of a fragment of soft tissue measuring 3.5 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm. Microscopic examination reveals features consistent with a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST), WHO Grade III. No specific sites of origin are identified, but the lesion is abutting and possibly arising from a nerve bundle. There is no evidence of residual schwannoma or neurofibroma within this sample. The specimen shows focal areas of tumor necrosis. Mitotic activity is brisk (>10 mitoses/10 high power fields). Surgical margins are widely involved by the tumor. No lymphovascular invasion is identified.

1. Site: Left upper lobe lung
Justification: The text mentions ""a left upper lobe lung wedge resection"" and provides a detailed description of the specimen from that location.
2. Laterality: Left
Justification: The specimen is explicitly described as being from the left upper lobe, so we can determine the laterality as left.
3. Histology: Not provided
Justification: Although there are descriptions of various features seen in the specimen, such as ""cork brown"" tissue and ""parenchymal resection margin,"" these do not provide enough information to definitively diagnose a specific histological type.
4. Stage: Not provided
Justification: The text does not contain any information about the stage of the disease or tumor.
5. Grade: Not provided
Justification: There is no mention of the grade of the tumor in the given text.
6. Behavior: Not provided
Justification: Without a definitive histological diagnosis, it's impossible to determine whether the tumor is benign or malignant and thus provide information on its behavior.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ain diagnosis/diagnoses:  
Locally advanced, peripheral bronchopulmonary, histologically mixed adenocarcinoma of the right upper lobe of the lung with an acinar and solid component, slight mucin formation and localization in S1 and S2. TNM classification on the basis of this material pT3 pN0 pMX V1 R1, stage IIB. C34.1 M8255/3.  
Comment/supplementary remark:   
The carcinoma has spread into the adhesive part of the chest wall, where it has infiltrated both 
the soft tissue and the 3rd rib, extending in a circumscribed manner as far as the outer resection surface at the thoracic skin, which explains the R1 classification. The carcinoma has also spread as far as the visceral pleura of the adhesive part evidently from S6 of the upper lobe. The resection marg in of the bronchus and vessels, the other resection margins of the 
resected chest wall material, the lung parenchyma of the resection material evidently taken from S6 and all the lymph nodes identified and removed are tumor- free. 
 
"," 1. ""Site"": Lung (right upper lobe). Justification: The report specifically mentions the right upper lobe of the lung as the site.
2. ""Laterality"": Right. Justification: The report clearly states that the tumor is located in the right upper lobe of the lung.

ain diagnosis/diagnoses:  
Mixed adenocarcinoma located peripherally in the lower lobe with a predominant acinar 
component, a smaller large-cell solid component with a bronchioloalveolar growth pattern in the tumor periphery, slight mucin formation and marked lymph vessel propagation in the lung tissue and the visceral pleura.  
 
Comment/supplementary remark:   
Conventional histology shows a peripheral bronchopulmonary carcinoma (to be verified by 
immunohistological analysis). The tumor has infiltrated the visceral pleura, focally penetrated the surface of the pleura and extends as far as the basal margin of the preparation after the row of metal clamps is removed.  
These findings thus give a tumor classification of pT2 pNX pMX L1 RX, with localization code C34.3 and morphology code M8255/3. 
 
"," 1. ""Site"": Lung. Justification: The report clearly states the tumor is located in the lung, specifically in the lower lobe.
2. ""Laterality"": Not provided. Justification: The report does not specify whether the tumor is on the left or right lung.
3. ""Histology"": Mixed adenocarcinoma with a predominant acinar component and a smaller large-cell solid component. Justification: The report describes the tumor as a mixed adenocarcinoma with two components, the most prominent being acinar.
4. ""Stage"": T2 NX MX. Justification: The tumor has infiltrated the visceral pleura and focally penetrated the surface of the pleura, which corresponds to a T2 stage. The report does not provide information about lymph node or distant metastasis, so these are marked as unknown (NX, MX).
5. ""Grade"": Not provided. Justification: The report does not mention any details about the differentiation of the tumor cells.

FINAL REPORT
HISTORY
Mass removed (l obect omy). ?Malignant.
MACROSCOPICThree specimens received
1: The specimen is labelled `right upper lobe plus ribs' and consists of a
right upper lobe measuring 180 x 105 x 45 mm. There is a vertical stapled line
superior to the hilum measuring 80 mm in length. Over the apex there are two
attached short segments of ribs. Rib 1 is relatively closely adhered over the
pleural surface and measures 55 x 30 x 28 mm. This rib is cut towards one end,
22 mm from the true resectionmargin. Rib 2 loosely hangs from a fibrous.
fragment and measures 55 x 28 x 18 mm. Over the posterolateral aspect of the,
lung is a small segment of adherent parietal pleura measuring 30 x 25 mm.
Within the apex, underlying, the ribs is a firm white lesion measuring 25: x 25 x
23 mm. The mass shows focal central necrosis. The tumour is well clear of the
hilar resection margin. The apical rib is removed and the underlying pleural
surface is inked black. The true pleural margin is inked blue. The tumour
appears to invade the pleura within this region, but does. not extend Into the
overlying soft tissue. The remainder of the lung parenchyma showssevere
emphysema with bullae in the apical aspect surrounding the tumour. No other
focal lesions are. seen or felt throughout the lobe. [1 A, bronchial resection

2: The specimen is labelled `lymph node number 10' and consists of fragments of
lymph node measuring 20 x 8 x 6 mm. (BIT: 2A)
3: The specimen is labelled `fourth rib right' and consists of a rib fragment
with attached soft tissue. The rib measures 12 x 17 x 7 mm. The attached soft
tissue measuring 17 x 1.0 x.10 mm. No obvious lesion is identified within the
specimen. [3A, soft tissue BIT; 313, rib].
Please note that sections from the ribs in specimen 1 and 3 to follow.
MICROSCOPIC
1.Sections show a peripheral moderately-differentiated squamous cell
carcinoma. Thereis pronounced desmoplasia and a central area of necrosis in
association with the tumour. There is obliteration of the pleural space
overlying the tumour due to .adhesions and desmoplasia .It is difficult to
interpret the layers but there is clear invasion through pleura and into chest
wall. The involved fat appears to represent lipomatous metaplasia of pleura

rather than chest wail fat. Tumour does not extend as far as the muscle or
bona and therefore the chest wall margin appears clear. The bronchial
rc-tion margin shows no evidence of in situ or invasive malignancy. No
lymphatic, vascular or perineural invasion is seen. The sampled lymph nodes
show sinus histiocytosis with moderate amounts of carbon pigment and no
evidence of metastatic carcinoma. The surrounding lung parenchyma shows focal
lipoid pneumonia and emphysema. Collections of smokers macrophages are
present.
COMMENT
No sections of the ribs have been examined at this stage as the tissue is still
being decalcified .Sections of the ribs will be examined in due course and a
final report issued.
2. Sections of lymph node show sinus histiocytosis and a moderate amount of
carbon pigment deposition and silicate crystals. There Is no evidence of
metastatic carcinoma.
3. Sections show normal intercostal muscle and adipose tissue. There is no
evidence of invasive or metastatic carcinoma-.

Macroscopic findings: TCGA-66-2756  
1. (a-m) Left superior pulmonary lobe: resected lobe weighing 634g, and measuring 240 x 130 x 60 mm, with 
remnants of pleural adhesion and, adhering tightly to the hilar section, a pericardiallobe measuring 75 x 50 mrn, 
with slightly whitish thickening and subhemorrhaging. In S 3 there is grayish-white, brittle, yellowish necrosis 
and anthracotic pigment including a polycyclic, well demarcated tumor, measming 75 x 50 x 95 mrn, extending 
under the pericardia! lobe described and, with unclear demarcation, to the adjacent subpleural and mediastinal 
adipose tissue. B3 is tumorous in the intermediary section and destructed. The remaining segmental bronchi, 
which can be dissected up to the periphery, are unremarkable. In the hilar section there are anthracotic 
pigmented and swollen, non-tumorous lymph nodes. In the peritumoral puhnonary tissue there is a golden­
yellow, mesh-like parenchymal image (xanthomatous retention pneumonia?) and in S 1, accentuated in the 
apical section, there is clear puhnonary emphysema with a coarse structure and possible honeycomb lung. 
2. Phrenic nerve: Grayish-brown, restif01m excised material, 6 mrn in length. 
3. (a-b) Aortopulmonary window: bipartite lymph adipose tissue, measuring' 25 x 20 x 10 mrn in total, with 
anthracotic pigmented lymph nodes, which are also in parts swollen and display adipose tissue. Complete 
embedment. 
4. L 11: quadripartite, measuring almost 10 mrn in total, blackish pigmented lymph node tissue. 
5. L 9: bipartite measuring 6 mrn in total, blackish pigmented lymph node tissue. 
6. L 7: segmented, measuring 5 mrn in total, blackish pigmented lymph node tissue. 
Microscopic findings: 
1. (HE, PAS, EvG) tumor-free bronchial wall in the instantaneous section and the subsequent paraffrn 
embedment in the bronchial resection margin. Immediately next to this there are numerous lymph nodes, some 
with significant anthracotic pigment, with sinus histiocytosis and lymphofollicular hyperplasia as well as acute 
blood clotting. The described tumor, made up of solid and garland-shaped structures oflarge, pleomorphic cells 
with a significantly misaligned nucleoplasmic ratio, chromatin coarsening and frequent mitosis with multiple 
necrotic inclusions and concomitant stromal desmoplasia without keratinizing growth. Penetration of the 
mediastinal pleura with intrusion, starting focally, into the lipomatous-atrophic thymus tissue. The adjacent 
pericardia! lobe is still tumor-free and there are further small non-tumorous lymph nodes embedded in the 
mediastinal adipose tissue. In the apical section of Sl there is a subpleural area of scarring with fibroelastosis 
and nearby, a significantly bullous and emphysematous lung structure with rarefied, stubby, upright and 
partially inflamed alveolar septa. In the peritumoral, intraalveolar area there is a partly compact build-up of 
foamy cellular macrophages.

PART #1: RIGHT LOWER LOBE RESECTION
Resident Pathologist:
The specimen is received fresh labeled and designated
right lower lobe resection. It consists of one grossly recognizable
right lower lobe weighing 290 gm and measuring 16 x 13 x 4 cm.
Bronchial and vascular margins are shaved. Hilar lymph nodes are
sampled. Palpable tumor is noted. The surface is inked black. A
surgical stapled margin is noted. Hilar lymph nodes are sampled.
Palpable tumor is noted. Surface is inked black. A surgical stapled
margin is noted, measuring 7 cm in length. It is shaved and placed
in cassette A. Another stapled surgical margin is noted closer to the
hilum and measures 3 cm in length. It is shaved and placed in
cassette B. Another staple line is noted measuring 8 cm in the
apparent superior portion of the lobe. It is shaved and placed in
cassette C. The specimen is sectioned to reveal a firm white-gray
lobulated mass measuring 5 x 4.7 x 3 cm. This mass closely abuts the
hilar portion of the lung. in addition, it puckers to the pleura.
Representative sections of the hilar area representing probable
mucous plug in the bronchus are placed in cassette D. Normal lung is
placed in cassette E. Tumor's closest approach to hilar bronchi are
placed in cassettes F-G. Tumor does appear to invade bronchus.
Tumor's closest approach to pleura is placed in cassettes H and I.
Representative sections of tumor and adjacent lung are placed in
cassettes J and K. Representative tumor in cassettes L-N. L also
contains a pleural margin. No other mass lesions are noted.
Representative sections are submitted.

GROSS DESCRIPTION :(Continued)
E.Labeled ""left lung"" and received fresh for tumor banking is a 741 gram. 21.0 x 14.0 x
6.0 cm lung .This is the left lung with the expected two lobes. The pleural surface is
mildly congested and pink-tan with diffuse anthracotic marbling. The upper lobe is
centrally indurated and is sectioned to have an 8.5 x 8.0 x 5.5 cm central cavitated and
necrotic tumor mass. There is focal peripheral calcification .Further sectioning shows
the mass to be 3.7 cm from the bronchial margin. The parenchyma of the superior upper lobe
is mildly congested and spongy .The tumor is in the mid upper lobe ,superior to the hilar
structures. The parenchyma surrounding the tumor is somewhat consolidated and tan. The
tumor does not cross to the lower lobe ,however appears to abut the lower lobe .The tumor
appears to distort and focally involve the vessels and bronchi of the upper lobe. The
bronchi adjacent to the tumor contain opaque ,purulent mucus .There are multiple large
anthracotic hilar lymph nodes surrounding the bronchus and bronchioles .The lymph nodes
appear to be focally positive for tumor .The parenchyma of the lower lobe has similar
spongy,mildly congested appearance. There is mild pale parenchyma with focal
consolidation in the inferior aspect of the lower lobe. This area may represent mild
post-obstructive pneumonia .No additional tumor-like masses are identified.
Representative sections are sampled as labeled:
El -bronchial margin and adjacent lymph node
E2 --vascular margin
E3-E5 -sections of tumor to pleura in-an area of roughened pleura consistent
with adhesion
E6 -sections showing tumor between upper and lower lobes

Examination report 
Macroscopic findings: 
I. Parietal pleura: excised material, one with a diameter of max. 5 and one with 
a diameter of 4 mm. 
2. (a-i) Left inferior pulmonary lobe: resected lobe weighing 277 g and 
measuring 180 x 120 x 70 mm with moderate mesh-like anthracosis of the pleura, hilar staple sutures and an 
exposed bronchial stump measuring just under I 0 mm. Next to this, individual, swollen lymph nodes with 
anthracotic pigment but no suspicion of a tumor. In S 6 there is grayish-white tumor infiltration, well­
demarcated around the edge, measuring a good 40 rmn, extending up to the outer pleura, with central, post­
necrotic-pseudocystic resorption featuring small lesions, and grayish-yellow, fragile, infiltrated, inflammatory 
pulmonary tissue. In B6, no discernible tumor infiltration or destruction in the central branches examined. 
Immediately next to the tumor there is an inflammatory, adherent section of lung (from the middle pulmonary 
lobe?), closed in by the base clip, measuring 15 mm, and without any discernible tumor infiltration. Other than 
the tumorous and pneumonic infiltration on laminated sections, no further focal fmdings. 
3. L 12: bipartite, pale lymph node tissue with anthracotic pigment, measuring 
just under 10 mm together. 
4. (a-b) L 11: segmented lymph adipose tissue with anthracotic pigment, 
measuring 25 mm together, also displaying blood coagulation in between (complete embedment). 
5. (a-b) L 9: bipartite lymph adipose tissue, measuring just under 20 mm 
together. Nodes with anthracotic pigment and unremarkably imposing (complete embedment). 
6. 
7. L7: bipartite lymph adipose tissue, measuring 10 mm together 
L 4: node with anthracotic pigment and adipose tissue, measuring 10 mm. 
8. L 3: adipose tissue measuring 10 mm, with im unremarkable node measuring 
5 mm and with anthracotic pigment. 
Microscopic findings: 
I. (HE) In the instantaneous section and the subsequent paraffin embedment, 
pleura biopsy with knotty sclerohyalinosis with slit-shaped dehiscences between the thickened, collagen fiber 
bundles. Base lymphoid infiltration and slight subpleural adipose connective tissue. 
2. (HE, f: PAS, e to h: EvG) The central bronchial amputation border has a 
bronchial wall with a regular stmcture, as does the peribronchial soft tissue. Next to this and further towards the 
central and hilar section there are lymph nodes with anthracotic pigment build-up and moderate histiocytosis as 
well as slightly lymphatic hyperplasia and small scarred areas. The tumor described comprises mesh-like 
infiltrative, growing structures of a pluriform, partly keratinizing, partly severe pleomorphic cell and squamous 
cell carcinoma with a clearly misaligned nucleoplasmic ratio, coarsening of the chromatin and prominent 
nncleoli and frequent mitosis. Extensive necrosis in the center of the tumor, with pseudocystic transformation, 
with concomitant stromadesmoplasia and lymphoid and lymphofollicular infiltrates in the tumor periphery. 
Extension to the perifocal, reactive, fibrosed pleura with fibrinous exudate which is no longer fresh; the base 
membrane of the pleura, with fragmented, elastic membrane here, is, however, not infiltrated. 
Hemangioinvasion in the tumor center with a formation of obliterative tumor thrombi. Next to the tumor there 
are several confluent alveolar cavities with a build-up of granulocytes and foam cell macrophages, fibrinous 
exudate and fmally confluent, sprouting mesenchyme buds as well as expanded bronchia with mucus permeated 
by a large quantity of leucocytes. 
 3. (HE) Tumor-fi'ee lymph node tissue with Iymphofollicular hyperplasia, with 
activated germinal centers, sinus histiocytosis aud marked anthracosis.

Diagnosis: 
Resected left inferior lobe I. to 8. with a centrally postnecrotically-pseudocystically transformed, poorly 
differentiated aud focal, keratinizing, maturing squamous cell carcinoma, measuring a maximum of 40 mm, and 
located in the periphery of S 6. It extends to the still tumor-free, reactive, thickened pleura. The lobe also 
displays hemoangioinvasion, and, in the peritumorous section, partly purulent, partly xanthomatous retention 
pneumonia, and a tumor-free bronchial resection margin, as well as adjacent and hilar tumor-free lymph nodes 
with anthracotic pigment. In samples 3 to 8 there are further tumor-free lymph nodes with anthracotic pigment 
and parietal pleura with a small build-up of hyaline plaque. 
Tumor classification: 
M-8071/3, G3, pT2, pV 1, pN 0, pMX, stage I B. R 0. "," 1. Site: Left inferior pulmonary lobe. Justified as the report clearly states the tumor is located in the left inferior pulmonary lobe.
2. Laterality: Left. The report specifically mentions the location as the left inferior pulmonary lobe.
3. Histology: Poorly differentiated and focal, keratinizing, maturing squamous cell carcinoma. As stated in the diagnosis and tumor classification sections of the report.

REPORT ON FINDINGS 
Macroscopy 
1.) Pleura (according to sample vessel received squamous epithelium): flat tissue measuring 1.5 x 0.8 em, up to 
0.2 em thick, surface predominantly shiny and red in patches. 
2.) Inflated, fixed resected left upper lobe measuring 21 x 10 x 6 em, central bronchus resection plane located 
0.5 em proximal to the bifurcation of the lingular bronchus. At the hilus are 5 partly lesioned grayish-black 
nodes between 0.4 and 1. 7 em in size. The lateral region over segments I and 2 and also adjacent sections of S3 
show an area of parietal pleura measuring 13 x 11.5 em that is extensively adhesive in most parts, loosely 
attached in other parts and shows plate-like thickening up to 0.3 em at the caudal margin in an area of max. 2 
em. At the upper mai·gin of the adhesion zone are two interlinked costal segments 6 and 8.5 em long, 
respectively, each clearly resected, and adhesive soft tissue up to 0.5 em thick. Below the pleural adhesion is a 
soft to moderately finn, pale brown to whitish and centrally markedly soft tumor, max. 6 em in size, with 
unclear demarcation and the main mass located in segment 2 and adjacent sections of S 1 and S3, extending to 
the pleura in the region of tbe adhesion zone. Truncation of peripheral branches of B2 in the tumor. Section 
surfaces of the intercostal soft tissue at tbe area of site with the lung show a grayish-white area of 1.3 em; costal 
segments do not show macroscopic inflltration by the tumor tissue. Tumor spread right up to the caudal margin 
of the adhesive part of the pleura. Dorsal pleura over segment 1 at the junction with segment 2 shows patchy 
whitish discoloration and thickening in an area of 6.5 em, where there are isolated metal staples. Rest of 
parenchyma inconspicuous. At the bifurcation of tbe upper lobe bronchus are tbree grayish-black nodes 
between 1.6 and 2.1 em. In the subpleural region of segment 3 is a 3 em grayish-black node. 
3.) Visceral pleura left lower lobe: nine flat or membranous specimens between 0.5 and 3.8 x 2 em and up to 0.2 
em thick with a partly shiny, partly roughened or vaguely tubercular surface. 
4.) Lobar LN (station 12) left: lingula: 2.2 em lesioned grayish-black node or node part. 
5.) Lobar LN (station 12) left lower lobe.: 0.5 em lesioned grayish-black node. 
6.) Interlobar LN (station II) left: 0.5 em lesioned grayish-black node with some surrounding tissue. 
7.) Hilar LN (station 10) left:1 cmlesioned grayish-black node. 
8.) Paraesophageal LN (station 8) left: 0.8 em grayish-black node. 
9.) Subcarinal LN (station 7): 1.5 em node with some surrounding tissue, containing further 0.1 em node. 
10.) Subaortic LN (aortopulmonary window) (station 5) left: 0.9 em lesioned grayish-black node. 
11.) Lobar LN (station 10) right: 1.5 em lesioned grayish-black node or node. 
Examined: 
1.) Rapid section remains, 
2.) 2 sections of tumor with remaining parenchyma, 3 sections with pleura in region of adhesion zone (ld 
ventral resection margin of pleural tissue color-marked), 2 sections of caudal margin of parietal pleura (color­
marked), 2 sections of plate-like pleura thickening, Sl/2 with whitish pleura, S2 dorsal, node at bifurcation of 
bronchus (partly halved, in 2i + j), subpleural nodes in S3 + central bronchus resection line and resection 
 margins of vessels, hilar nodes (2 larger ones multi-segmented+ each separate in 2m+ n, second-largest halved 
in 21), 2 sections of costal segments with grayish-white area, 
3.)-11.) All material (in 3. preparation lamellated, in 4., 10. + II. nodes halved in each case, in 9. larger node 
multi-segmented, smaller node isolated), 
27 blocks, partly Elastica-van Gieson, PAS, diastase-PAS, iron staining, decalcification. 
Microscopy 
Re 1.) Immediate intraoperative evaluation ( ): marked inflallllllation, blood pigment deposit, 
individual marked larger cells, but no evidence of carcinoma. 
After paraffin embedding: 
Description of histological and cytological findings omitted for capacity reasons. 
EVALUATION 
Primary diagnosis/diagnoses: 
Locally advanced, peripheral bronchopulmonary, histologically poorly differentiated nonkeratinizing squamous 
cell carcinoma of the upper lobe of the left lung mainly located in S2. TNM classification according to this 
picture pT4 pNO pMX Rl, IIIB. C34.1 M8070/3. 
Secondary diagnosis/diagnoses: 
Pleural tissue with marked chronic inflallllllation, blood pigment deposit and fibrous thickening (sample 1.)). 
Extensive tumor necroses. Active chronic organizing pneumonia in the tumor envirollll1ent. Moderate to marked 
active chronic peripheral bronchitis and bronchiolitis. Foci of fibrin-rich and chronic granulating visceral 
neuritis over Sl. Hypoce!lular fibrosis zone of the adherent part of the parietal pleura (sample 2.)). Lymph 
nodes with uncharacteristic reactive lesions, anthracotic pigment deposits and sclerosis zones (samples 2.) and 
4.) -11.)). 
Remark/addendum: 
The tumor extends to the adherent part of the parietal pleura and the soft portions of the co-resected parts of the 
chest wall. With regard to the localization data, sample 3.) shows a discontinuous spread of the carcinoma 
within pleura enlarged by fibrosis and showing fibrinous chronic inflallllllation, although no conclusion can be 
drawn as to whether this is a visceral or parietal layer. The resection margins of bronchus and vessels of the 
main preparation, the costal segments of the chest wall tissue, the repeat resection material from the pleura in 
sample 1.) and all excised lymph nodes are tumor-free. The Rl category is explained by the fact that the tumor 
has spread focally as far as resection surface of the adherent part of the parietal pleura adjacent to the chest wall. 
No asbestos bodies are found in the prepared section planes, but much further-reaching investigations, 
especially dust analyses, are needed to determine the asbestos exposure of the lung.

Lung,,Adenocarcinoma,,High grade or poorly differentiated (Grade III),Malignant,TCGA-99-8028.pdf,  ," Report: 
The sample consists of a fragment of tissue with a size of 3.5 x 2.1 cm. The specimen is partially covered by a fibrous capsule. In the subcapsular region, there is a tumor focus of 1.8 cm in its greatest dimension. The tumor demonstrates diffuse growth and consists of atypical cells with hyperchromic nuclei and scant cytoplasm. Mitotic activity is high. Necrosis is present. Vascular invasion is not identified. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells show positivity for CK7, CK19, and Ki-67 (labeling index 40%). The findings are consistent with a high-grade malignant neoplasm, morphologically and immunophenotypically suspicious for a primary pulmonary adenocarcinoma.

 COMMENT  
 
This case was initially signed out as a provisional report on  
, and has been amended to include results of immunohistochemical 
stains. The diagnoses have not changed from the original report. 
The lymph nodes resected in the case (specimen 1-8} show diffuse 
involvement with well-formed non-necrotizing granulomatous inflammation. 
Occasional mixed dust nodules with central hyalinization and focal 
central necrosis are also present. Special stains for fungal elements 
and acid-fast organisms are negative. There is no evidence of metastatic 
carcinoma in any of the lymph nodes examined. 
;ctions of the tumor in specimen 8 show predominately moderately 
differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (90%}, with a small component 
(10%} of a poorly differentiated spindle cell carcinoma that demonstrates 
shows multiple mitoses and severe cytologic atypia. There is no 
malignant cartilage, bone, or skeletal muscle identified in the spindle 
cell component. Immunohistochemistry shows the squamous cell component 
of the tumor to be positive for multiple cytokeratins (HMWK, CK5/6, 
AE1/AE3} and p63. The spindled component shows weak positive staining 
for CK5/6 and p63, with very focal positive staining for CK7. The EGFR 
shows strong membranous staining in approximately 90% of both the 
moderately differentiated-component and the spindled component. Both 
components are negative for p53 and TTF-1. The findings are consistent 
with a pleomorphic carcinoma composed of predominantly squamous cell 
carcinoma (moderately differentiated, 90%} and pleomorphic spindle-cell 
carcinoma (poorly differentiated, 10%}, pT2NO. 
The residual lung parenchyma in both specimen 1 (""wedge resection right 
middle lobe""} and specimen 8 (""right lower lobe""} shows patchy 
interstitial fibrosis that appears accentuated in a subpleural 
distribution, with focal areas of architectural remodeling and cyst 
formation (microscopic honeycomb change} . There is mild chronic 
interstitial inflammation associated with areas of fibrosis. Fibroblastic 
foci are readily identified. The blood vessels show focal fibrointimal 
thickening, likely secondary to the background inflammatory process, but 
no diagnostic evidence of active vasculitis. Granulomas are noted within 
an intraparenchymal lymph node (specimen 1}, but are not identified in 
the lung parenchyma itself . 
• ne overall findings in the lung tissue are in keeping with pulmonary 
Status: corrected Page: 3 of 6 
 fibrosis of UIP pattern. However, the simultaneous presence of numerous 
non-necrotizing granulomas within the lymph nodes is not typical of UIP, 
and may indicate a second superimposed process, the differential 
diagnosis of which is broad but which could include infections, drug 
reactions, and sarcoidosis. correlation with clinical and microbiologic 
findings is recommended.

GROSS DESCRIPTION 
             A.  Received fresh, subsequently fixed in formalin labeled 
             ""left upper lobe"" is a 196 gram, 16 x 11 x 4.5 cm. lobe of 
    lung which is partially covered with a gray violaceous smooth 
    glistening pleura which shows diffuse black stippling. The hilum is 
    heavily stapled. There is a 1.5 cm. umbilication which is located 
    opposite of the hilum. This area is inked blue and the specimen is 
    sectioned in this area to show a 3.2 x 3.2 x 2.3 cm. 
    well- circumscribed white-tan indurated lesion. This comes within 4.5 
    cm. of the hilar margin. This is contiguous with the umbilication. 
    The remainder of the parenchyma is red- pink and spongy showing no 
    other discrete gross lesions identified. Possible hilar node is 
    grossly identified. Representative sections of the specimen are 
    submitted as follows:

MACROSCOPIC
Three specimens received
1:The specimen. is labelled 'right upper lobe' and consists of a lobe of lung
that has been previously sampled for research purposes. This lobe measures 140
mm (SI), 20 mm (ML) and 180 mm (AP). There is puckering of the pleural surface
on the anterolateral surface measuring up to 25 x 20 mm. Scarring is noted on
the posterolateral surface measuring up to 10 x 10 mm. The apex shows some
emphysematous changes. On sectioning a firm cream tan tumour with black
pigmentation is identified within the lung parenchyma. It has a maximum cut
surface area of 32 x 20 mm in dimension. The tumour is located 30 mm away from
the bronchial resection margin. It is located within 1 mm of the pleural
surface. (Representative sections: 1A, bronchial resection margin; 18,
peribronchial node bisected; 1C-D, one node bisected, one slice each block; 1E,
one node bisected; IF, sections of tumour nearest to pleural surface; 1G,
tumour; 11-1, tumour and the surrounding lung parenchyma; 1I, lung with
emphysematous changes; 13, scarring of lung; 1K, presumed normal lung tissue;
It., further bronchial margin.]
2:.The specimen Is labelled hilar lymph node and consists of a lymph node
measuring 5 x 3 x 3 mm in dimension. [Bisected and BIT: 2A]
3:The specimen is labelled 'No 4 and No 10 lymph node and consists of
multiple pieces of yellow brown tissue ranging in size from smallest 5 x 3 x 3
mm to largest 32 x 25 x 20 mm. The largest node appears to be involved with
tumour. No extra capsular spread identified. (3A, four possible nodes; 3B-C' IRS
of largest node)
MICROSCOPIC
1:Sections reveal a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma showing
areas of clear cell change. The tumour does not directly invade visceral
pleura. There is extensive lymphatic invasion with tumour present in adjacent
lymphatic channels within pleura, pulmonary septa and along the course of
bronchovascular bundles. Tumour is present within a lymphatic vessel at the
bronchial resection margin. No tumour is identified within bronchial wall at
the bronchial resection margin. The peribronchial lymph nodes are involved by
tumour. The tumour deposits are present within afferent lymphatic channels,
subcapsular sinuses, and are also distributed throughout lymph node parenchyma.
Lymph node. tissue also shows reactive changes with sinus histiocyto.sis, carbon
pigment deposition, scattered flecks of birefringent material consistent with
silicate, and hyallnized sillcotic nodules. No vascular invasion or perineural
permeation by tumour is seen. Immediately adjacent to the tumour there is a Page 2of2
localised area of endogenous lipoid pneumonia. Remaining lung parenchyma shows
emphysema and respiratory bronchiolitis. Vascularised pleural adhesions are
also present.
2: Sections reveal lymph node tissue which is partially involved by squamous
cell carcinoma showing clear cell change.
3: All sections (3A-3C) reveal lymph node tissue which is partially. involved by
squamous cell carcinoma showing clear cell change. Lymph node tissue also
shows reactive changes with follicular hyperplasia, sinus. histiocytosis, carbon
pigment deposition, scattered flecks of birefringent material consistent with
silicate, and hyalinized silicotic nodules.

MACROSCOPIC
One specimen submitted.
The specimen is labelled 'left upper lobe' and consists of a lobe of lung
measuring 230 x 100 x 20 mm in the uninflated state .A number of builous
structures are present at the apex of the lobe over an area 40 x 20 mm. There
is a small area of fibrous pleural thickening on the lateral aspect of the lobe
over an area approximately 20 x 20 mm .Beneath this area of thickening is a
palpable tumour mass .The pleura moves over this mass and does not appear to
be involved .At the hilum there are two bronchial profiles ,10 and 8 mm in
diameter. Very few peribronchial nodes are included .A stapled resection
line, 70 -mm in length ,extends posteroinferiorly from the hilum. Transverse
slicing reveals an .extensively necrotic tumour mass 25 x 25 x 20 mm ,lateral to
the hilum and approaching the lateral pleural surface .The cut surface of this
tumour has a variegated grey and yellow appearance .Adjacent to the tumour is
an ill defined area of yellowish .discolouration of lung parenchyma measuring
approximately 10., mm in maximum dimension. There is also an ill-defined area. of
parenchymal fibrosis adjacent to the tumour .Elsewhere the lung parenchyma
shows .severe emphysematous changes .[IA, bronchial .resection margin; 1B,
peribronchial lymph nodes ;IC-1E tumour with overlying .pleura ;IF, area of
yellowish discolouration ;1C, ill-defined fibrous scar adjacent to tumour ;i.i.-i,
apical bulb; 11 ,uninvolved lung parenchyma superior to tumour; ii, involved
lung parenchyma inferior to tumour.)
MICROSCOPY
Sections show moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma measuring 25mm
inmaximum dimension. There is extensive tumour necrosis with associated foamy
macrophages and cholesterol clefts. The periphery of the carcinoma has a
growth pattern filling air spaces. Extensive vascular invasion is present at
the periphery of the carcinoma together with focal perivascular lymphatic space
invasion. There is mild fibro-elastotlc scarring of the visceral pleura
adjacent to the tumour but no evidence of pleural invasion by the carcinoma.
The carcinoma is.clear of the bronchial resection margin which shows focal
squamous. metaplasia and mild squamous dysplasia. The area of yellow
discoloration adjacent to the carcinoma shows focal collapse, interstitial.
fibrosis and locailsed obstructive changes including dilated air spaces
containing numerous macrophages and proteeinaceous fluid. Within this region
there is a mildly dilated bronchiole showing focal moderate squamous dyspiasia.
There is also an area of dense fibrous scarring adjacent to the carcinoma. The
non-neoplastic lung shows scattered mixed dust macules and aggregates of
pigmented airspace macrophages. Apical bullous emphysema is present and this is
associated with subpleura.l fibrosis and prominent chronic inflammation together
with focal fibrous obliteration of the pleural space and a small amount of 1 ""64.4 .c.va. h.
adherent chest wall fat. The peribronchial lymph nodes show sinus
histiocytosis and mild carbon pigment deposition but no evidence of malignancy.

of gray black fleshy tissue surrounded by yellow adipose tissue. 
Specimen sectioned and entirely submitted in a single cassette. 
Container labeled"" 3 -right lung"" is a 759 gram 
focally sectioned lung grossly consistent with right lung. The 
bronchial margin is the primary bronchus at a point 1.0 ern from 
bifurcation of the secondary bronchi. Surrounding the bronchial 
margin are several well defined partially fragmented gray black 
fleshy nodules up to 3.0 cm. The largest nodule on sectioning 
appears to be a mat of smaller similar nodules. The pleura is 
focally shaggy wrinkled gray red to black with marked anthracotic 
streaking. On the anterior aspect in the upper mid region of the 
upper lobe extending on the lateral aspect is an area of sectioned 
induration and umbilication which has been sectioned to expose a 5.7 
x 5.4 x 5.1 em necrotic gray tan fibrotic lesion with irregular 
borders. This has a necrotic anthracotic streaked cut surface and 
grossly appears to extend to but not through the pleura in this 
area. This lesion is seen 3.1 cm from the nearest bronchial margin. 
A bronchial connection is grossly identified. On sectioning the 
remaining parenchyma shows markedly congested spongy tissue with 
marked emphysematous change which is most prominent in the upper 
lobe in the apex in the perilesional region where there are cavitary  Page 2 of3 
air filled spaces with trabeculated inner linings up to 3.6 em in

CPT: 88309, 88305 x 4, 88312 x 2 
Comments The slides were reviewed by Dr. 5 who agrees with 
the diagnosis. Page 3 00 
The carcinoma measured 5.7 em in greatest diameter and, therefore, 
is pathologically staged as a pT2b. Two peribronchial lymph nodes in 
the right lung resection (specimen three) as well as a small area 
from random section from the right upper lobe parenchyma in 3M show 
focal degeneration and necrosis vii th surrounding chronic 
granulomatous inflammation and fibrosis. Therefore, an acid fast 
stain is performed which demonstrates no acid fast bacilli (with 
appropriate positive control). A GMS stain is performed which 
demonstrates no fungal organisms (with appropriate positive 
control) . 
Specimen two, submitted as lymph node level 7 right chest, and 
specimen four, submitted as lymph node level 8 right chest, both are 
received as fragmented to partially fragmented soft tissue and, 
therefore, an accurate node count cannot be performed. No metastatic 
carcinoma is identified. 
The carcinoma is poorly differentiated and demonstrates foci of 
necrosis and degeneration. In some areas intercellular bridges and 
eosinophilic cytoplasm consistent with focal keratinization is 
identified, consistent with a poorly differentiated squamous cell 
carcinoma. Clinical correlation and followup is recommended.

Clinical Notes: 
SCC left lower lobe lung. 
Macroscopy: 
Specimen is labelled ""left lower lobe"" and consists ofa lobe of lung measuring 125 x 75 x 60 mm in 
the fresh state. There is a cavitated mass present within the lung measuring 70 x 55 x 40 mm with 
overlying thickened pleura. On sectioning, it contains thick bloodstained semi-liquid material. 
Surrounding the cavity, the wall is irregularly roughened and thickened by white sclerotic tissue. The 
surrounding lung is yellow in keeping with endogenous lipid pneumonia. It appears well clear of the 
bronchial resection margin. No other lesions are identified on sectioning of the lung. [RS bronchial 
resection margin and peribronchial lymph nodes, A; tumour and pleura, B-C; RS tumour, O-E; RS

 KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS  
 
 
Referring PhysicianBody Site: Lung  
Specimen Type: Slides  
Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma  
 RESULTS: Wild -type gene.  
 INTERPRETA TION: No mutations were identified at codons 12 and 13 
of the KRAS gene.  COMMENT:  
Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to be associated with poor prognosis, and resistance to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies in patients with non -small- cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  
KRAS mutations occur in 15-30% of NSCLC patients and are strongly associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking history.  This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene; based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated  
for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and codon 13 mutations in fresh, frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue. In particular the test performance has been established in samples of  
colorectal cancer and non -small cell lung carcinoma which harbor  
these mutations, although several other tissues are also known to harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix, etc.).  Analysis of EGFR mutation or gene amplification status may provide additional information regarding this patient's probability of response to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies, if clinically indicated. See references.  
  
METHOD/LIMITATIONS:  
Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is  
selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified  
and amplified by polym erase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to  
exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13; primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel  
electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

 EGFR Mutation Analysis 
 
 
 Referring Physician:  
 Body Site: Lung  
 Clinical D ata: Adenocarcinoma 
 RESULTS: No mutation detected.  
 INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified in the sample provided for analysis. Fewer than 5% of non- small cell lung carcinoma  
patients without identifiable mutations are reported to be  
responsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies.   COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more tumor cellularity is optimal  
for this mutation analysis. The sample submitted showed 30% tumor cellularity upon pathologist review.  A frequently occurring sequence change 2361G>A (Q787Q) was  
identified. This polymorphism is known not to have clinical significance.  
 Mutations in the tyrosine domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with differential  
responsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapies. The objective response rate among patients with a sensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%.  This assay analyzes exons 18 -21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain; 
based on the current literature, most mutatio ns in non- small- cell 
lung carcinoma (NSCLC) are expected to occur in these exons.  
Mutations present in less than 10-20% of extracted DNA may not be detected by this method. Mutation status in a sample may change during tumor progression or the course of therapy; therefore, this  
result cannot be used to infer the presence or absence of a mutation in another sample or sub-sample obtained from this tumor.  This test is validated for non- small cell lung carcinoma. The  
clinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types is unknown.  METHOD/LIMITATION:  
 Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is  
selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the samples, quantified  
and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to  
exons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by 
bi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary gel  
electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants or som atic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

  INTERPRETATION:  
Negative for a rearrangement involving the ALK gene.  
 Probe #Nuclei Examined % Positive Nuclei % Control values 2p23(ALK)V 100 0 <15.0 A total of 100 cells were scored.  
 FINDINGS: FISH was performed on paraffin embedded tissue sections using dual color break-apart probe (Abbott Molecular) to the ALK gene at 2p23. This probe flanks the entire gene. If a rearrangement involving ALK is present, inversion or translocation, one of the two probe signals separates as one red (orange) and one green signal. In  
this specimen, separated signals were present in 0.5% of the nuclei scored. Based on laboratory validation data, the se results are  
within the normal limits.  
 COMMENTS: Three to four copies of ALK were observed in 27.0% of cells. This gain of intact ALK fusion hybridization signals  
represents an aneuploid population with extra copies of chromosomes 2/2p ALK region. Additional copies of ALK are not uncommon in NSCLCs, although the significance of extra copies of the ALK gene in lung carcinoma is unclear at this time (

Consultant's Findings:
A c.2235 2249de1 (p.E746 A750del) mutation was
detected in Exon 19 of the EGFR gene. This mutation is
reported to correlate with RESPONSIVENESS to EGFR
tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies in patients with non-small-
cell lung cancer.
Mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal
(Continued on next page.) Page4
growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be
associated with differential responsiveness/resistance to
targeted therapeutics for non-small-cell lung cancer
(NSCLC).
Most data published pertain to Gefitinib similar
data have been seen in studies using Erlotinib
This test is validated for non-small cell lung carcinoma.
The clinical significance and utility of this test in other
tumor types is unknown.
Method: This assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGFR
tyrosine kinase domain. Based on current literature, the vast
majority of mutations are expected to occur in these exons.
Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant
tumor is selected for analysis. DNA is extracted from the
tissue and subject to PCR amplification using primers to
exons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. The amplification products
are analyzed by bi-directional direct DNA _
sequencing using capillary gel electrophoresis and
fluorescence detection. The analytical sensitivity of the
assay is 20% mutant alleles, or 40% tumor cells with a
heterozygous mutation; mutations present in a low
percentage of cells may not be detected.

PART #2: LEFT LOWER LOBE
Resident Pathologist:
Dictated by:
The specimen for Part 2 is received in formalin, labeled with the
patient's name, anddesignated 'Left Lower Lobe.' The
specimen consists of a 15.0 x 15.0 x 2.5 cm grossly recognizable lung
lobe weighing 167.5 gm. The pleural surface is red-purple, wrinkled
and glistening. A surgical incision is present over a grossly
apparent mass which measures 2.3 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm. The pleural surface
overlying this mass appears puckered. The pleural surface overlying
the tumor mass is inked black. This tumor is located in the superior
aspect of the lobe, approximately 1.8 cm from the bronchial margin.
Three (3) staple lines are present on the lung measuring 6 cm, 4 cm
and 2 cm. The first two (2) staple lines are removed to reveal
underlying grossly unremarkable lung parenchyma which is inked
orange. The third staple line contains vessels which are sectioned
and submitted. A shave section of the bronchial margin is also taken.
No grossly identifiable hilar lymph nodes are present. The tumor
nodule is thoroughly serially sectioned to reveal that it abuts the
pleura and is 0.4 cm from the surgical resection margin. The tumor
mass appears to surround large vessels in the lung parenchyma.
Representative sections of tumor relative to pleura, vessels, and
surgical resection margin are submitted. Serially sectioning through
the remaining lung tissue identified two (2) subpleural nodules which
were suspicious for tumor involvement. Representative sections are
submitted. No other masses or lesions are identified within the lung,
The uninvolved lung parenchyma appears tan-red and grossly
unremarkable. Representative sections of the uninvolved lung are
submitted.

PATROT,CCY REPORT
GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A.The specimen consists of a 173 gram, 17.3 x 9.0 x 2.6 cm left
upper lobe specimen with a 3.0 cm in length staple line adjacent to
the bronchial margin. The visceral pleura is tan-pink to pink-purple
displaying anthracosis. There is an area of pleural retraction with a
central umbilication with underlying induration located 6.2 cm from
the bronchial margin. The visceral pleura is inked blue overlying the
induration. The bronchial margin is removed en face for frozen
section diagnosis.

COMMENT: There are multiple granulomas present in the lymph nodes
(specimens A-F). The GMS and AFB stains are negative for definitive
fungal organisms or mycobacteria. Clinical correlation is recommended.
Microscopic isolate tumor cell clusters extend to alveolar and
vascular spaces of lung parenchyma in vicinity of mass. The tumor
clusters measures 2.0 mm in single greatest dimension. Since
multifocal lymphovascular invasion is identified, these isolated tumor
cells may arise from vascular spreading. The tumor approaches, but not
extends through visceral pleura.

EGFR Mutation Analysis
Referring Physician:
Body Site :Right upper lobe of lung
Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma
RESULTS :No mutation detected.
INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified in the sample provided
for analysis. Fewer than 5% of non -small cell lung carcinoma
patients without identifiable mutations are reported to be
responsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies.
COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more tumor cellularity is optimal
for this mutation analysis. The sample submitted showed 90% tumor cellularity upon pathologist review.
A frequently occurring sequence change 2361>GA (Q787Q) was
identified .This polymorphism is known not to have clinical
significance.
Mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with
differential responsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase
inhibitor (TKI) therapies. The objective response rate among
patients with a sensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%.
This assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain;
based on the current literature ,most mutations in non -small-cell
lung carcinoma (NSCLC) are expected to occur in these exons.
Mutations present in less than 10 -20% of extracted DNA may not be
detected by this method .Mutation status in a sample may change
during tumor progression or the course of therapy; therefore, this
result cannot be used to infer the presence or absence of a mutation
in another sample or sub-sample obtained from this tumor.
This test is validated for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The
clinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types
is unknown.
METHOD:
Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is
selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified
and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to
exons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by
bi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary gel
electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or
negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants
or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

ADDENDUM 3:
Integrated Oncology
MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY
KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS
Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma
RESULTS: Wild type gene.
INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified at codons 12 and 13 of
the KRAS gene.
COMMENT:
Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to be associated with poor prognosis ,and resistance to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor
therapies in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). KRAS
mutations occur in 15-30% of NSCLC patients and are strongly
associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking history.
This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;
based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are
expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of
the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low
percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated for
use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and codon 13 mutations in fresh,
frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue. In particular
the test performance has been established in samples of colorectal
cancer and non-small cell lung carcinoma which harbor these
mutations, although several other tissues are also known to harbor
KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix,
etc.).
Analysis of EGFR mutation or gene amplification status may provide
additional information regarding this patient's probability of
response to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies, if
clinically indicated. See references.
METHOD/LIMITATION:
Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is
selected for analysis .DNA is isolated from the sample ,quantified
and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to
exon 2 of the KRAS gene .PCR products are subjected to single
nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;
primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel
electrophoresis and fluorescence detection .False positive or
negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants
or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

Fluorescence In-Situ Hybridization (FISH)
Referring Physician
Body Site: Right upper lobe of lung
Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma.
INTERPRETATION:
Negative for a rearrangement involving the ALK gene.
Probe #Nuclei Examined %Positive Nuclei %
Control values
2p23(ALK)V 50 0 <15.0
A total of 50 cells were scored.
FINDINGS: FISH was performed on paraffin embedded tissue sections
using dual color break -apart probe ( , to the ALK gene at 2p23. This probe flanks the entire gene. If a rearrangement
involving ALK is present, inversion or translocation ,one of the two
probe signals separates as one red (orange )and one green signal. In
this specimen ,separated signals were present in 0.5% of the nuclei
scored. Based on laboratory validation data, these results are
within the normal limits.
COMMENTS :Three copies of ALK were observed in 32 .0% of cells. This
gain of intact ALK fusion hybridization signals represents an
aneuploid population with extra copies of chromosomes 2/2p ALK
region. Additional copies of ALK are not uncommon in NSCLCs,
although the significance of extra copies of the ALK gene in lung
carcinoma is unclear at this time (Salido M. et al . J Thorac Oncol.
2011;6:21-27)
ISCN RESULTS: nuc ish (ALKx3 4)[38/50]
This Vysis ALK Break Apart Probe FISH test (. , is FDA
approved for use in the detection of rearrangements involving the
ALK gene via fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in
formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE ) non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) tissue specimens.

"," Site: The specimens are received from various sites including the 6th rib, Level 9 lymph node, Level 11 intralobar lymph node, Level 5 lymph node, Level 12 lymph node, and left upper lobe of the lung.

Laterality: The laterality is provided only for the left upper lobe specimen, while it is not provided for the others.

Histology: The histological type of the tumor in the left upper lobe is not specified in this report.

Stage: The stage of the tumor is not provided in this report.

Grade: The grade of the tumor is not provided in this report.

Behavior: The behavior of the tumor, whether it is benign or malignant, is not provided in this report.

The reason for restricting the output to these six categories is that they are commonly used to describe and classify neoplastic lesions, including their location, laterality, histological type, stage, grade, and behavior. However, in this report, some of this information is not provided, making it challenging to fully answer the question.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lung,,Adenocarcinoma,,High grade or poorly differentiated (Grade III),Malignant,TCGA-55-8614.pdf,  ," Report: 
The sample consists of a fragment of tissue with a size of 3.5 x 2.1 cm. The specimen is partially covered by a fibrous capsule. In the subcapsular region, there is a tumor focus of 1.8 cm in its greatest dimension. The tumor demonstrates diffuse growth and consists of atypical cells with hyperchromic nuclei and scant cytoplasm. Mitotic activity is high. Necrosis is present. Vascular invasion is not identified. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells show positivity for CK7, CK19, and Ki-67 (labeling index 40%). The findings are consistent with a high-grade malignant neoplasm, morphologically and immunophenotypically suspicious for a primary pulmonary adenocarcinoma.

1. Site: Lung. Justification - The report mentions the findings to be consistent with a primary pulmonary adenocarcinoma.
2. Laterality: Not provided. Justification - The report does not specify whether the left or right lung is affected.
3. Histology: Adenocarcinoma. Justification - The report suggests a high-grade malignant neoplasm, morphologically and immunophenotypically suspicious for a primary pulmonary adenocarcinoma.
4. Stage: Not provided. Justification - The report does not contain information regarding the TNM stage of the tumor.
5. Grade: High grade or poorly differentiated (Grade III). Justification - The report mentions high-grade malignant neoplasm, indicating a high grade for this cancer.
6. Behavior: Malignant. Justification - The tumor demonstrates diffuse growth, consists of atypical cells with hyperchromic nuclei and scant cytoplasm, has high mitotic activity, presents necrosis, and shows vascular invasion, all indicative of malignancy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

REPORT ON FINDINGS 
Macroscopy 
1) Right upper lobe: inflated, fixed preparation measuring 19 x 14 x 6.5 cm, with predominantly shiny pleural 
surface, altogether slightly patchy or reticulate, grayish black markings. Laterobasal zone of adhesion over 52 
and the border area of segments 2 and 3, where there was a part of the chest wall up to 12 x 9 cm in size 
including a rib segment 5.8 cm long. In addition a membranous part of the adhesive parietal pleura, fatty in 
places, 12 x 9 cm in size lying clear over S2 and 51. The latter extensively covered the lateral parts of 52 and 
bordering sections of 51 and was mainly without adhesion to the visceral pleura. There was another zone of 
adhesion in a medial direction, at about the point of attachment of the part of the chest wall, attached by a 
parenchymal flap enclosed by a row of clip sutures 6.5 x 5 x 2 cm in size (part of 56? middle lobe?). A nodular 
tumor, maximum 6.2 cm in size, at the base of 52, with dirty, whitish section surfaces, also focal grayish yellow 
softening, sharp and markedly arched distinction from the adjacent parenchymal tumor on one side, on the 
other side continuous infiltration of the visceral pleura and extension to the parenchymal flap attached 
medially, where it extended to just by the base of the preparation and the row of clip sutures. In the region of 
the contact point with the part of the chest wall, blackish thickening of the fused pleural lamina. Central 
discontinuation of B2 about 1.7 cm distally of the bifurcation in the tumor tissue, also of one of the sub­
segment branches of B3. The other bronchial branches free as far as the peripheral sections. About 3.5 cm 
away from the principal tumor in 51 a second, rather irregularly formed, pale grey tumor 1.6 cm in size in the 
sub-pleural parenchyma, distance from pulmonary tissue with normal section surfaces to the pleura about 3 
mm. Central bronchial resection line located immediately proximal of the segment division point, by the 
bronchial stump a moderately solid node with dark grey pigment, 2.2 cm in size, damaged in places. 
2) Lobar LN (item 12) upper lobe: irregular, predominantly heavily pigmented fragment of 1.8 cm. 
3) Lobar LN (item 12) right lower lobe: node with blackish pigment, 1.8 cm in size, with some surrounding 
tissue. 
4) Inter-lobar lymph node (item 11) right: two fragments with largely blackish pigment, of 0.7 and 1.2 cm. 
5) Hilar LN (item 10) right: two nodes with grayish black pigment, 1.3 and 1,8 cm in size. 
6) Hilar LN (item 10) right (no. II): node 2.7 cm in size, apparently damaged and with blackish pigment, with

Microscopy 
1) The large tumor made up of small and large solid links of varying lengths, reticulate or branched in places, 
and of occasional evident large atypical epithelial cells coated in epidermoid cells, with ample, in the main 
weakly eosinophilic cytoplasm and nuclei showing major variation in coarse chromatin nuclear structure. 
Numerous apoptoses, frequently at least five mitoses in a highly magnified viewing field. No inclusion of 
mucin, instead intercellular bridges were repeatedly identified. In the center of solid tumor cell links, 
degenerative changes in kariopyknoses and occasionally instances of cells showing dyskeratotic keratosis near 
small and large areas of necrosis. Basic pulmonary tissue completely destroyed, development of fibrous 
connective tissue moderately rich in cells with inclusion of inflammatory cells and vessels with thick walls, 
some of which were filled with tumor cell links. Pleural border exceeded by tumor over a broad area in the 
region of a lobar cleft, also incursion into the visceral pleura over a broad area, where the adhesive part of the 
parietal pleura was free of tumor, only fibrotic. In addition here more pronounced chronic inflammatory cell  infiltrate. Towards the exterior including transversely striped muscle and intact rib bones with hematopoetic 
cells of all kinds and to a lesser extent fat cells in the marrow cavity. In the small tumor focus also nests and 
links of a solid, large cell tumor with characteristics of squamous cell epithelium structure, with here a short 
stretch of replacement of original respiratory epithelium of a peripheral bronchus by atypical squamous cell 
epithelium. Also destruction of the underlying pulmonary tissue, which was replaced by collagen and elastic 
connective tissue, enclosed follicular lymphocyte aggregate and other inflammatory cells. Partially widened 
airways in the pulmonary tissue free of tumor, slight deposition of anthracotic pigment in peribronchiolovasal 
connective tissue and alveolar parenchyma with quite predominantly soft interstices. No evidence of tumor at 
the displacement borders of the bronchus and large pulmonary vessels, respiratory mucosa normal. Lymph 
nodes at the hilus with deposition of anthracotic pigment, accumulation of large macrophages and a few 
secondary follicles. Adjacent lobes of the parietal pleura mainly entirely soft, only stretches of development of 
slightly fibrotic connective tissue. Substantial adjacent fatty tissue in places. 
2) -11) Lymph nodes and parts of lymph nodes of various sizes with only occasional secondary follicles, 
expansion of the paracortical or T zone, increase in capillary vessels in places, deposition of anthracotic pig­
ment of varying thicknesses and small focus of trabecular sclerosis. Small nerve stems and vessels of various 
lumen sizes in the surrounding fatty tissue, including in sample 7) a small artery. 
12) Fatty tissue in the shape of small lobes in places made up of single-vacuole fat cells, several enclosed 
capillary vessels and narrow and broad bands of transversely striped muscle, which were also found in the 
border areas. 
EVALUATION 
Right upper pulmonary lobe with one large and one small focus of a poorly differentiated, large cell squamous 
cell carcinoma not tending towards keratinization. The large tumor located in S2 and adjacent parts of 
segment 3, extending from the center to the periphery, encroaching over the part of segment 6 or the middle 
lobe removed and infiltrating the pleural over a broad area, is therefore probably primarily a peripheral 
bronchopulmonary carcinoma with a satellite node in the lobe on the same side. The adhesive part of the 
parietal pleura above the tumor was not infiltrated by the tumor, and the soft tissue and the resected part of 
the ribs were also free of tumor. Partial necrotic alteration of the principal tumor, with vascular incursions in 
this as well. Pulmonary parenchyma free of tumor largely normal, no hyaline plural plaque in the resected 
pleura. Displacement borders of bronchus and large pulmonary vessels and all removed lymph nodes free of 
tumor. An intramuscular lipoma in sample 12) without criteria for malignancy. 
Tumor formula in accordance with the foregoing pT4 pNO Vi RO equivalent to stage IIIB. 
Morphology: 8070/3

MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:  
The specimen is received in six parts, each labeled with the  
patient's name.  
 1. Part one is received fresh, labeled 'pleural biopsy'. It  
consists of white to yellow soft tissue measuring 0.2 x 0.1 x 0.1  
cm. The specimen is  entirely submitted for frozen section then into  
cassette 1A.  
 2. Part two is labeled 'level # 9 lymph node'. It consists of an  
anthracotic lymph node measuring 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm. The specimen is  
submitted entirely in cassette 2A.  
 3. Part three is received in formalin, labeled 'level # 11 lymph  
node'. It consists of three anthracotic lymph nodes measuring 1.2 x  
0.8 x 0.3 cm in aggregate. The specimen is submitted entirely in  
cassette 3A.  
 4. Part four is received in formalin, labeled 'level #7 lymph node.  
It consists of three lymph nodes measuring 1 x 0.8 x 0.3 cm, 0.5 x  
0.5 x 0.3 cm and 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm. The specimen is submitted 
entirely.  
 
5. Part five is labeled 'left lower lobe'. It consists of a left  
lower lobe of lung, weighing 180 grams, measuring 18 x 12 x 8.5 cm.  
The pleura is pink tan glistening and has a puckered area, measuring  
3 x 3 cm which is inked in black. The pleura is heavily mottled with  
 fine black streaks. The resected bronchial margin measures 2.5 cm, 
and the hilar margin measures 3 cm. The specimen is serially  
sectioned and cut surface reveals an ill -defined firm gray white  
tumor, measuring 4.7 x 3.5 cm, located 1 cm from the resected  
bronchial margin; the overlying pleura is puckered. The remainder  
of the lung parenchyma is pink red blotchy. Also noted are ten  
anthracotic firm lymph nodes, ranging from 0.5 cm to 1.2 cm obtained  
from the peri- hilar area. Representative sections are submitted.  
 6. Part six is received in formalin, labeled 'level #5 lymph node'.

CLINICAL HISTORY AND PRE - OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
VI ex-smoker (40 pack- years )with a 2.9 cm RML adenocarcinoma.
MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received in four parts ,each labeled with the
patient 's name.
1. Part one is received fresh, labeled 'wedge superior segment right
lower lobe, stitch at nodule, freeze nodule, at 09:28'. It consists
of a wedge biopsy of the lung measuring 10.5 x 3.5 x 1.5 cm. The
staple line measures 11 cm which is shaved and the parenchyma around
is inked blue. The pleura are gray pink glistening and reveal a pre
cut which is marked with a stitch. The precut area of the pleura is
puckered and reveals a gray white ground glass nodule, measuring 0.8
x 0.8 cm located 2 cm from the staple line margin. The remainder of
the parenchyma is pink red blotchy and crepitant. No other nodule is
grossly identified. A frozen section is performed on the nodule
marked with a stitch and resubmitted for permanent section.
Representative sections are submitted.
2. Part two is received in saline, labeled 'right middle lobe'. It
consists of right middle lobe of the lung, measuring 16 x 9.5 x 3.2
cm. The bronchial margin measures 1.8 cm and the vascular margin
measures 1 cm at the hilum. The pleura is gray pink glistening and
moderately mottled with fine black streaks. Also noted a precut and
puckered area on the pleura. Beneath the puckered area there is a
gray white subpleural firm nodule measuring 2.5 x 2 x 1.5 cm,
located 1 cm from the staple line margin and 2 cm from the hilar
stricture. Cut surface of the nodule is gray tan and reveals some
necrotic area. The remainder of the parenchy.ma_is pink. red- blotchy-
and emphysematous. Multiple anthracotic lymph nodes measuring from
0.3 cm up to 0.6 cm in largest dimension are identified from the hilar area. 80% of the nodule and representative section of the
specimen are submitted.
3. Part three is received in saline, labeled 'level 4 lymph node'.
It consists of five anthracotic lymph nodes measuring from 0.2 up to
0.8 cm. Entire lymph node is submitted in one cassette.
4. Part four is received in saline, labeled 'level 7 lymph node'.
It consists of two anthracotic lymph nodes measuring 0.5 and 0.8 cm
in greatest dimension. Entire two lymph nodes are submitted in one
cassette.

KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS
Referring Physician:
Body Site: Right lower lobe of lung
Specimen Type: Slides
Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma
RESULTS: Positive for a p.G12C (c.34G> T) mutation in codon 12
of the KRAS gene.
INTERPRETATION:
Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to correlate with poor
prognosis and resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies in
patients with non- small-cell lung cancer.
COMMENT:
KRAS mutations occur in 15-30% of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
patients and are strongly associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking
history.
This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;
based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are
expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of
the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low
percentage of cells may not be detected.
This test is validated for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and
codon 13 mutations in fresh, frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin
embedded tissue. In particular the test performance has been
established in samples of colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung
carcinoma which harbor these mutations, although several other
tissues are also known to harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of
pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix, etc.).
METHOD/LIMITATIONS:
Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified
and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to
exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single
nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;
primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel
electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or
negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants
or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

EGFR Mutation Analysis
Referring Physician
Body Site: Right lower lobe of lung
Clinical Data :Adenocarcinoma
RESULTS: No mutation detected.
INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified in the sample provided
for analysis. Fewer than 5% of non-small cell lung carcinoma
patients without identifiable mutations are reported to be
responsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies.
COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more tumor cellularity is optimal
for this mutation analysis. The sample submitted showed 90% tumor
cellularity upon pathologist review.
A frequently occurring sequence change 2361 G>A (Q787Q) was
identified .This polymorphism is known not to have clinical
significance.
Mutations in the tyrosine domain of the epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with differential
responsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)
therapies. The objective response rate among patients with a
sensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%.
This assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain;
based on the current literature ,most mutations in non-small-cell
lung carcinoma (NSCLC) are expected to occur in these . exons.
Mutations present in less than 10-20% of extracted DNA may not be
detected by this method .Mutation status in a sample may change during tumor progression or the course of therapy; therefore, this
result cannot be used to infer the presence or absence of a mutation
in another sample or sub-sample obtained from this tumor.
This test is validated for non- small cell lung carcinoma. The
clinical significance and utility of this testin other tumor types
is unknown.
METHOD/LIMITATION:
Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is
selected for analysis .DNA is isolated from the samples, quantified
and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to
exons 18 -21 of the EGFR gene .PCR products are analyzed by
bi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary gel
electrophoresis and fluorescence detection .False positive or
negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants
or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

GROSS DESCRIPTION 
             Received fresh, subsequently fixed in formalin, labeled 
             ""left upper lobe wedge resection"".  The specimen consists 
    of a wedge of lung which is 78 gram. The specimen is 15 x 5.5 x 4 
    cm. and has a stapled margin of 15 cm. The pleura is violaceous 
    smooth and glistening. There is a 1 x 1 cm. umbilication in the 
    pleura. This focus is inked and the specimen is sectioned to show a 
    3.5 x 2.5 x 2.4 cm. pink tan tumor which shows fibrous stippling 
    present. This is contiguous within the pleural umbilication. 
    Representative tissue was submitted for tumor procurement. The tumor 
    comes within 1.5 cm. of the sacral margin (inked black).  The 
    remainder of the cut surface of the lung is pink tan and spongy 
    showing no other discrete gross lesions.  Representative sections of 
    the specimen are submitted as follows:

_ ADENOCARCINOMA, POORLY DIFFERENTIATED. 
_ Tumor measures 3.5 x 3.5 x 2.9cm. 
_ Visceral pleura not involved by tumor. 
-MARGIN STATUS: POSITIVE. 
_ Soft tissue margin adjacent to the bronchial and vascular margins is positive for 
tumor; the bronchus and vascular wall are not involved by tumor. See comment 
below. 
_ Wedge margin is negative for tumor (tumor distance to margin=0.5cm). 
_ SIX BENIGN LYMPH NODES (0/6), (THREE BENIGN PERIBRONCHIAL LYMPH 
NODES, ONE BENIGN R10 NODE, TWO BENIGN R4 NODES). 
Comment: Although there is technically no tumor involving the bronchial or vascular 
margins, the peribronchial 50ft tissue (connective and alveolar tissue) is positive for 
tumor. This should likely clinically and surgically be treated as a positive 
bronchovascular margin. 
Immunohistochemical stains show positive staining for TTF-1, Napsin-A, and 
CK7. CK20, ER, and CDX-2 are negative. This staining pattern strongly supports the 
diagnosis of a primary lung adenocarcinoma.

Gross Description: Although the bronchial and vascuar margins are 
negative, the peri-bronchovascular connective 
and alveolar tissue is positive for tumor. This 
should likely clinically and surgically be 
considered as a positive bronchovascular 
margin. 
A. The specimen is labeled right upper lobe lung and is received without fixative. It consists of a 
lobectomy of lung weighing 163 grams. The lobe measures 12 x 11.5 x 3.5 cm. Just superior to the hilum 
of this lobectomy specimen, there is a wedge resection of additional lung suggestive of apical portion of 
right lower lobe. This adherent wedge resection measures 8 x 2.5 x 2 cm. The pleural surface of the 
upper lobe varies from tan to violet and appears smooth with very little anthracotic stippling. Where the 
lung wedge is adherent to the mid portion of the upper lobe, there is palpable firmness and slight 
retraction of the pulmonary parenchyma . The wedge resection is similarly adherent to the pleural surface 
of the lower portion of the upper lobe. A metallic staple line runs from the hilum of the lung along the 
inferior edge of the upper lobe and is 11 cm in length. The pleural surface overlying the adherent lung 
wedge and in the vicinity of the palpable firmness is inked blue. The staple line along the lung wedge is 
dissected free and the resection edge is inked green. On sectioning of this area of palpable firmness, 
there is a relatively well-circumscribed tan to pale yellow neoplasm which overall measures 3.5 x 3.5 x 
2.9 cm. This neoplasm abuts the pleural surface of the upper lobe and passes across the interlobar fissure 
between the upper lobe and the apical portion of the lower lobe, to involve the adherent wedge resection. 
This neoplasm is 0.5 cm from the closest bronchial margin, abuts the pleural surface in several areas, and 
is 0.4 cm from the stapled resection margin of the apical portion of the lower lobe. Sections of the 
remaining lung reveal pale red pulmonary parenchyma which appears relatively well-aerated. At the 
hilum of the lung, there are two 0.5-0.7 cm peribronchial dull red nodes. Dissection of the major bronchi 
reveal no intrabronchial tumor. The neoplasm is 6 cm or greater from the inferior staple line. 
Representative neoplasm is obtained in its fresh state for research purposes. Following fixation,

Clinical Details: 
Right upper lobectomy for carcinoma of lung. 
Patient has been exposed to asbeStos. 
Four specimens submitted: 
I: RIGHT UPPER LOBE 
Macroscopy: 
The specimen consists of a lobectomy specimen measuring 170 x 70 nun with a depth of up to 80 mm. 
Some puckering is present over the lateral pleural surface. The tumour measures 75 x 55 x 75 mm and 
abuts, does not clearly penetrate, the pleural surface. The tumour appears at least 20 mm clear of the 
hilar resection margin. There is no obvious endophytic bronchial component to the tumour, although it 
clearly is associated with bronchial structures. A separate small pleural nodule is identified, 45 mm 
from the nearest tumour. [Bronchial resection margin, I A; vascular resection margin, IB; hilar lymph 
nodes, I C-I G; block I E includes inked resection margin; pleural surface with tumour, I H-l I; tumour 
towards hilar aspect, 1)-1 L; separate pleural nodule, I M; macroscopically unremarkable lung, 1 N]. 
Microscopy: 
Sections show a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma with extensive central necrosis and 
cavitation. A definite bronchial origin is not identified. There is no evidence of pleural invasion, and 
the separate pleural nodule is shown to represent a silicotic nodule within a pleural lymph node. No 
lymphatic invasion is seen, however metastatic carcinoma is present in one of the peribronch ial lymph 
nodes. Vascular invasion is identified. The bronchial resection margin is clear of malignancy but 
shows a benign mucous gland adenoma. Lung parenchyma adjacent to the tumour shows organising 
pneumonia while distant lung parenchyma shows emphysema. 
2, HILAR LYMPH NODE 
Macroscopy: 
The specimen consists ofa piece of dark brown tissue, 4 x 4 x 3 mm. [BtT,2AJ 
Microscopy: 
Sections show fragments of lymph nodes containing large numbers of pigmented macrophages but 
showing no evidence of metastatic carcinoma. 
3, PARTIAL BRONCHUS RIGHT SIDE 
Macroscopy: 
The specimen consists ofa portion of bronchial wall measuring 25 x 15 x 5 nun. No obvious mucosal 
abnonnality is identified. {Serially sectioned and all pieces blocked, 3AJ. 
Microscopy: 
Sections show full thickness bronchial wall in which there is no evidence of the mucous gland 
adenoma seen in the resection margin of specimen I. However there is squamous metaplasia with 
severe dysplasia which falls short of carcinoma in situ. There is no evidence ofinva.sive malignan cy. 
Conclusion: 
Partial bronchus right side: squamous metaplasia with severe dysplasia. 
4: MEDIASTINAL LYMPH NODE 
Macroscopy: 
The specimen consists of a lymph node measuring 8 x 6 x 3 mm with attached fatty tissue. [AlIlissue

MACROSCOPIC
Three specimens submitted.
1.The first specimen is labelled 'left lingula lobe` and consists of a piece
of lung measuring 110 x 65 x 29 mm. The visceral pleural surface is smooth and
unremarkable, and does not show evidence of puckering. A stapled margin
measuring 83 mm in length is identified at one edge. Serial slicing shows a
solitary tumour deposit within the lung. Itmeasures 23 x 20 x 22 mm. It is
located 4 mm from the pleural surface, 20 mm from the stapled surgical
resection margin, and 16 mm from the hilar resection margin. The cut surface of
the tumour is firm and solid with no evidence of cavitation. The tumour appears
to arise from the airways. The lung tissue distal to the tumour and remaining
lung parenchyma shows no macroscopically identifiable pathology. No lymph nodes
are identified. [1A, shave bronchial resection margin; 113, shave vascular
resection margin; 1C, rep TS of tumour showing Its relationship to the

Large cell Ca. Left upper lobe. 
MACROSCO PIC 
Three specimens received: 
I: The specimen is labelled '(R) upper lobe' (note labelling discrepancy regarding side stated on 
request form and that on specimen container) and consists of a left upper lobe of lung measuring 240 
mm SI x 175 mm AP x up to 60 mm ML in the inflated and fixed state. On the medial aspect there are 
two stapled resection margins. Both of these are linear. One extends superiorly from the hilar margin 
for a distance of 50 mm and the other extends inferiorly from the hilar margin for a distance of 90 mm. 
Each of these is trimmed and inked blue. The pleural surface is purple to pink in colour with 
prominent anthracotic pigment. An area of pleural adhesion is present over the lateral aspect. In the 
upper pole of the lobe there is a tumour. The tumour measures 80 mm in maximum dimension . The 
tumour is subpleurally located and focally the pleural surface is distorted and puckered to the 
underlying tumour. Fibrous adhesions are present overlying this area. The adjacent lung shows 
emphysema. The tumour is located 20 mm from the bronchial resection margin and 10 mm from the 
nearest surgical margin. The cut surface of the tumour varies from yellow to pink. Some of the pinker 
areas have a very ""fish flesh"" appearance . Focal necrotic areas are also present. [lA, bronchial 
resection margin; IB, peribronchial lymph nodes; IC-D, representative sections of tumour; lE-H, 
representative sections of tumour and pleura; II, tumour and nearest surgical margin; lJ, pleural 
adhesion; 1 K, distant lung]. 
2: The specimen is labelled 'lower lobe lymph node' and consists of a black lymph node measuring 
up to 11 mm in maximum extent. [2A, BIT]. 
3: The specimen is labelled 'pulmonary vein' and consists of a nubbin of fatty and lymph nodal tissue ~ 15 x 15 x 5 mm. Two anthracotic lymph nodes are identified. [3A, BIT]. 
MICROSCOPY 
1: Sections show a moderate and poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with irregular zones of 
necrosis. The lesion is subpleural and infiltrates the overlying pleura. Vascularised pleural adhesions 
are present both adjacent to the tumour and away from the tumour. No unequivocal pleural surface 
involvement is seen and tumour is not present at the pleural margin. Blood vessel invasion is present. 
No lymphatic invasion or perineural permeation is identified. The tumour is clear of the bronchial and 
stapled surgical resection margins. The lymph nodes show reactive follicular hyperplasia, sinus 
histiocytosis and carbon deposition . No tumour is identified within the lymph nodes. The adjacent 
lung shows emphysema and respiratory bronchiolitis. 
2: The sections oflymph node show sinus histiocytosis and carbon deposition. There is no evidence of 
malignanc y. 
3: The sections oflymph node show follicular hyperplasia , sinus histiocytosis and carbon deposition. 
There is no evidence of malignancy.

MACROSCOPIC 
Two specimens received: 
1: The specimen is labelled 'left upper lobe' and comprises a lobe oflung measuring 230 x 140 x 35 
mm after fonnalin inflation. There is an area of roughening of the pleural surface on the medial aspect 
of the lobe anterior to the hilum measuring 40 nun in diameter. Several bullae are present at the apex 
where there is again some irregular pleural thickening and roughening. No obvious tumour is apparent 
on the pleural surface. Serial transverse slicing reveals an irregular pale tumour mass, 37 mm in 
greatest diameter, occupying the central portion of the superior part of the lobe. Tumour is at least 25 
mm deep to the closest pleural surface. It is also at least 30 mm from the bronchial resection margin. 
Uninvolved lung parenchyma shows moderately severe emphysema. No satellite lesions are identified. 
[lA, peribronchial lymph node; IB, bronchial resection margin; Ie-D, complete TS of tumour 
bisected; IE, uninvolved. parenchyma from apex; IF, uninvolved parenchyma from lingula]. 
,[X,emoen is labelled 'lymph node upper lobe' and comprises an irregular portion of fatty and 
measuring 17 x 12 x 4 nun. [BIT after bisection, 2A]. 
MICROSCOPIC 
I. Sections show a very poorly-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Tumour is growing as large 
nests and sheets of cells with central necrosis. Very focal but convincing keratinization is taking place. 
The lesion is located halfway between the pleura and the hilum and pleural invasion is not identified. 
There is no blood vessel invasion and no lymphatic permeation is seen. No perineural penneation is 
identified. The lesion is well clear of the bronchial resection margin. Peribronchial lymph nodes are 
showing sinus histiocytosis and contain some carbon pigment but metastases are absent. The adjacent 
lung shows prominent emphysema. 
2. The sections show lymph node tissue in which there is sinus histiocytosis and carbon pigment but 
no evidence of tumour. ! 
SUMMARY 
Left upper lobe of lung and lymph nodes: 
1: Poorly-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma; 37mm in maximal dimension;. 
2: No blood vessel, lymphatic or perineural invasion present; 
3: No pleural invasion identified; clear of bronchial margin; 
4: No lymph node metastases;

REPORT ON FINDINGS 
Macroscopy 
1) Mediastinal biopsy: flat preparation rich in fatty tissue, 1 em in size, accumulation of blood on the upper 
surface. 
2) Right upper lobe: Inflated, fixed preparation 19 x 12 x 8 em in size, with predominantly hazy, cloudy, coated 
pleura with brownish red coated over the apex, moderately to very patchy or reticulate grayish black markings 
on the surface. Over the lateral and laterodorsal parts of segments I + 2 part of the chest wall adhering to the 
surface measuring up to 10.5 x 8.5 em with inclusion of two rib segments, each end smoothly separated. 
Beneath this a solid tumor, in places with relatively clear arcuate demarcation against the surr-ounding 
parenchyma, max. 8.5 em in diameter, extending from the center to the periphery, taking up at least half the 
preparation, with dirty, grayish white section surfaces and slate-gray towards the center. On the sawn section 
surfaces infiltration of the visceral and parietal pleura in an area at least 4 em in size and continuous spreading 
into the subpleural farty tissue, both rib segments intact. Towards the cranial circumferential border of the part 
of the chest wall, narrow, extended and rurming tangentially to the pleura, where tumor tissue could hardly be 
distinguished from the fused and blackish whitish thickened pleural lamina. B1 and 2 not identifiable within the 
tumor mass, incursion into the lumen also in the central section of B3, also here at least 1 sub-segment branch 
incorporated into the tumor and destroyed by it there, the others moderately extended towards the periphery and 
with tough, viscous material in the lumen. Extending from the previous B1/2 bifurcation region, whitish tumor 
tissue severely constricting the upper lobe ostium and growing into the lumen of the main bronchus from the 
outside. Bronchus displaced like a cuff, resection lines about 7 mm proximally and 5 mm distally of the upper 
lobe ostium by the main and the intermediate bronchus, where the central resection border was marked with 
thread. The visceral pleura was pushed forward in places by the tumor over the medial and lateral mediastinal 
parts. Pale grayish yellow densities in segments I and 2 in particular, but also in segment 3, plus small or very 
small patches of grayish white induration zones, striated in places, especially in Sl. Two solid, pigmented nodes 
up to 1.8 em in the peribronchial and hilar fatty tissue, the larger with focal, pale gray section surfaces. 
3) Left mediastinal repeat resectate: flat, fibrous, irregular, fatty preparation with surface smooth in places 
and rather irregular in places, and clip in the vicinity of one end. 
4) Hilar LN (item 10) right: part of a pigmented node 2.8 em in size. 
5) Subcarinal LN (item 7): part of a pigmented node 2.6 em in size with some fatty surrounding tissue and light 
grayish white section surfaces in places. 
6) Hilar LN (item 10) left: longitudinal, fatty in places, grayish black in places, measuring 1.7 em. 
 Examined 
1) Rapid section residue+ residual material, 
2) Central (thread marked) resection line of main bronchus, peripheral bronchus resection line of intermediate 
bronchus, upper lobe ostium +central tumor, central B3 tumor, 2 tumors with part of chest wall (e: with both 
rib segments, f: cranial circumferential border; color marking of external and circumferential section surfaces), 
3 sections with 51 peripheral tumor parenchyma, displacement borders of the vessels + small nodes (include 
in b), larger nodes laminated by the bronchial stump (I),

4) + 5) Laminated preparation, 
6) Total preparation, 
15 blocks. 
Microscopy 
Re. 1) Intra-operative immediate evaluation ( : inflammatory infiltration of the pleura (?), 
some abnormally large cells included, but no evidence of tumor. 
Re. 2) Intra-operative immediate evaluation ( : both displacement borders free of tumor. 
Description of the histological and cytological findings omitted for reasons of capacity. 
EVALUATION 
Very large and locally advanced large and spindle cell, nonkeratinizing squamous cell carcinoma (WHO 
category 1.3.1) of the right upper pulmonary lobe, extending from the center to the periphery, with 
obliterating endobronchial growth in places, histologically poorly differentiated, with primary location in 
segments 1 and 2 and extension into the soft tissue of the parts of the chest wall with adhesions. Lymphatic or 
hemangioma tumor propagation at the central border of the bronchial cuff in parabronchial fatty tissue. 
Mucosa and wall of the central bronchus resection line, peripheral border of the bronchial cuff, vascular 
displacement borders, removal borders of the thoracic resectate, hilar resection surfaces, the lymph nodes 
from samples 2) and 4) -6) and the parts of the parietal pleura in samples 1) and 3), which show fibrinous, 
active, chronic inflammation in places, are free of tumor. Focal, active, chronic retention pneumonia and 
already old, sub-pleural zones of necrosis showing distinctive, chronically organizing and yellow brown 
deposits of pigment of uncertain origin in the vicinity of the tumor (site of previous removal of tissue? small 
peripheral pulmonary infarction?). Also peripheral, active, chronic bronchitis and bronchiolitis with focal intra­
alveolar mucosal retention, the substrate of respiratory bronchiolitis and mild, focal pulmonary emphysema.

associated with scar and small papillary and peripheral  
bronchioloalveolar components. Examination of elastic stains  
supports the finding of pleural invasion. No lymphovascular invasion  
is seen. The tumor is TTF1 positive and shows histologic simi larity  
to the patient's prior left upper lobe carcinoma (  This 
case has been reviewed at the intradepartmental daily consensus  
meeting.

CLINICAL HISTORY AND PRE - OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  
Lung nodule right, R/O c arcinoma 
 
MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:  
The specimen is received fresh in two parts, each labeled with the  
patient's name.  
 1. Part one is labeled 'pulmonary nodule.' It consists of a 4 x 3 x  
1.5 cm wedge resection of lung. The pleural surface is smooth tan  
red and glistening. It has been previously incised to reveal a 1.1  
x 0.8 x 0.7 cm tan white fairly well circumscribed firm mass, 0.3 cm  
from the stapled margin. The pleural surface in the area of the  
tumor is inked blue. The pleura near the stapled margin is inked black. Representative section is taken and submitted for frozen  
section. After frozen section the specimen is entirely submitted.  
 
 2. Part two is labeled 'sixth rib.' It consists of a 10.5 x 2.0 x  
0.6 cm segment of rib. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal  
no gross lesions. Representative sections are submitted after  
decalcification.

GROSS DESCRIPTIONS 
  
Received are six formalin-filled containers labeled with the patient's name and medical record number. 
The first container is additionally labeled ""station 9,"" It holds three nodules of tan/black, soft tissue which 
in aggregate measure 2.1 x 0.7 x 0.6 em. These are submitted in entirety in block 1. 
The second container is additionally labeled ""station 10."" It holds a single somewhat irregularly shaped nodule 
of tan/black, soft tissue which measures 2.2 x 1.1 x 0.7 em. The specimen is bisected and submitted in 
total in block 2. 
'l'he third container is appropriately labeled ''station 7."" It holds two nodules of tan, soft tissue using focal 
areas of black discoloration. The larger fragment measures 2.9 x 1.3 x 0.9 em, and the smaller fragment 
measures 1.8 x 0.6 x 0.5 em. The specimens are bisected and half of the smaller fragment and half of the larger 
fragment are submitted in block 3, and the remaining half of each specimen are submitted in block 4. 
The next container is appropriately labeled ""station 5."" It holds three irregular shaped fragments of tan, soft 
tissue with focal areas of black discoloration. In aggregate, these measure 3.2 x 2.2 x 1.2 em maximally. 
The specimen is submitted in its entirety in blocks 5 and 6. 
The fifth container is additionally labeled ""lymph node 4L."" It holds two nodules of tan/brown, soft tissue. The 
smaller nodule measures 0.7 x 0.4 x 0.5 em, and the larger measures 2.2 x 0.9 x 0.9 em. Both are submitted in 
block 7. 
The sixth container holds a left lung consisting of a left upper lobe as well as a left lower lobe and lingula. 
The apex of the left upper lobe has the pleural surface marked in black ink, and has previously been opened for 
tissue procurement revealing a tan/white lesion with central necrosis. The borders of this lesion are somewhat 
irregular. This mass measures 4.6 em x 4.2 em x 4.3 em. This lesion appears to come within half of a mm of the 
1eural surface. This lesion does not appear intimately associated with any airways grossly. The remaining lung 
renchyma appears tan/brown in color with focal enlargement of air spaces. 
Representative sections of the lesion and lung are submitted as per block summary. Several lymph nodes are 
present adjacent to the left upper lobe bronchus. They measure 1.5 and 1.2 and 1.1 em in diameter, respectively.

COMMENTS: 
Histologic sections from the right middle lobe wedge show a hamartoma. as seen in the frozen section slide. However, In addition to this finding. there are 
microscopic foci in sections not examined at the time of frozen section. These foci measure up to 0.3 em in greatest dimension individually. In addition, 
this section in slide A4 also shows multiple microscopic foci of tumor within subpleural lymphatic spaces. 
The main tumor in the right upper lobe is that of an adenocarcinoma which is moderately to poorly differentiated . Two foci of bronchioloalveolar carcinoma 
are also present in the shaved parenchymal margin. Multiple positive nodes are present. 
Current NCCN practice guidelines recommend detennination of EGFR and KRAS mutation status in adenocarcinoma of·lung to help select patients for 
Tyrosine-Kinase Inhibitor (TKJ) therapy. EGFR-activating mutations have been shown to be significantly associated with response to TKls and KRAS 
mutations are associated with TKI resistance. They are mutually exclusive in NSCLC. Additionally. recent data show that ALK (Anaplastic Lymphoma 
Kinase) gene rearrangements in adenocarcinoma of lung are associated with resistance to TKls and have favorable response rates to Crizotinib, the ALK 
inhibitor agent currently in clinical trials. Mutation analysis for KRAS and EGFR-TK domain and ALK gene rearrangement by FISH is available as the  Lung Cancer Mutation Panel. Testing may be performed on paraffin-embedded tissue from the primary or metastatic tumor or pleural fluid cell block. 
These tests are available on request as a panel or as individual assays.

IDID G ross Description
Labeled right lower lobe (bronchial margin). 
Received fresh forintraoperative consultation is a 162 g lower lobe of lung measuring 14.5 x11.5 x 3.5 cm. The pleural surface is tan to gray-brown and lightly
wrinkled with 3 subpleural nodular structures ranging 
from 0.4 to 0.6 cmalong the base. Along the posterolateral aspect near the base is a 2.7 x1.0 cm firm tan subpleural mass that comes to within approximately 5 cm ofthe bronchial margin, which is shaved and submitted for frozen section. Theoverlying pleura is puckering and is focally inked blue. Sectioning throughthe separate subpleural nodules reveals glistening gray-tan cut surfaces.The background lung is tan to red and spongy white to white-tan hilar lymphnode measuring 0.5 and 0.6 cm. 
 Microscopic Description
The bronchial margin is negative for carcinoma. In the section from the
bronchial margin, a small lymph node is identified which is negative for
metastatic carcinoma. Also, there are two additional hilar lymph nodes
which are both negative for metastatic carcinoma. The lung mass is aninvasive poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma merging with a peripheral
bronchioloalveolar type pattern. The invasive carcinoma focally involves
the visceral pleura surface. In this area, free floating tumor cells areseen in blood clot external to the visceral pleura surface. The vascular
margins are negative for neoplasm. No angiolymphatic space involvement bytumor is seen. The separate subpleural nodules are consistent with small
foci of metaplastic epithelial proliferations (honeycombing). These nodulesare composed of epithelial cells that have a mucinous as well asnonmucinous appearance and many demonstrate cilia. There is a focus of
squamous metaplasia associated with one of these areas. There is no nuclear
atypia. Nonneoplastic lung shows emphysematous features.
Immunohistochemical stains are performed for CK7, CK20, TTF-1, CDX 2 and
Napsin A. Control material for each individual stain demonstratesappropriate staining. The malignant cells are positive for Napsin A, CK7and TTF-1. There is focal positivity for CK20.  The malignant cells are
negative for CDX 2. These findings support the interpretation of a primary
lung adenocarcinoma. Diagnosis Details Comments

GROSS DESCRIPTION 
             A.  The specimen is received fresh for frozen section 
             labeled ""L4 (right lung)"" and consists of a 1.0 x 0.4 x 0.4 
    cm. aggregate of gray to tan tissue fragments entirely frozen as 
    frozen section AFS1. 
             B.  Received fresh labeled ""B. R4 (right lung)"" are 4 
             fragments of black to pink tissue measuring in aggregate of 
    2.0 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm. entirely frozen as frozen section BFS1. The 
    g  piece is bisected. 
    : 
       C.  Received fresh labeled ""level 10"" is a slightly 
             fragmented and cauterized, 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm. gray black 
    tissue in keeping with lymph node which is bisected and entirely 
    submitted in one block. AS- 1. 
 
             D. Received fresh labeled ""subcarinal"" are three irregular 
    fragmented, gray- black tissues in keeping with lymph nodes measuring 
    up to 2.0 cm. greatest dimension. The specimens are entirely 
    submitted in four blocks as labeled. AS-4 
    BLOCK SUMMARY:  1, 2 - One bisected node per cassette; 3, 4 - 
    bisected largest node (1/2 per cassette). 
 
             E.  Received fresh labeled ""right lower lobe and middle 
             lobe"" is a 400 gram, 14.5 x 12.0 x 7.5 cm. lobectomy 
    specimen consisting of a portion of right middle lobe measuring 10.0 
    x 5.8 x 3.5 cm. and the entire lower lobe.  A 1.5 cm. in length, 1.4 
    x 1.0 cm. in diameter bronchial stump is present. The pleura is 
    smooth to slightly scabrous, tan- pink with a few tan- pink fibrous 
    adhesions. A palpable peribronchial mass is evident. The overlying 
    pleura is inked black.  On sectioning, there is a moderately 
    well- circumscribed, 9.0 x 6.4 x 5.8 cm. glistening to focally chalky 
    tan- white tumor mass which focally abutts the bronchial stump (see 
    block 3). The tumor also extends to within 0.2 cm. of the inked 
    pleural surface. The tumor, located within the middle lobe grossly 
  
  
    extends to involve a matted group of perihilar lymph nodes (see 
    block 7). A portion of the tumor and a portion of normal parenchyma 
    are submitted for tissue procurement as requested. The remaining 
    parenchyma is spongiform, red- purple without additional mass lesion 
    or abnormality.  Five rubbery gray- black perihilar tissues in

    no metastatic tumor identified. 
             E.  Microscopic examination of the right lower and middle 
             lobe lung resection reveals - 
    Histologic type:  Squamous cell carcinoma with some minimal 
    glandular differentiation, predominantly nonkeratinized. 
    Histologic grade:  Moderately differentiated. 
    Primary tumor (pT):  Tumor is 9 cm in greatest dimension and 
    involves a major bronchus (pT2).

    Arterial (large vessel) invasion:  Not identified. 
    Lymphatic (small vessel) invasion:  Present. 
    Regional lymph nodes (pN):  Tumor is identified in one of seven 
    hilar lymph nodes.  This tumor focus measures 1 cm in greatest 
                                dimension and appears to represent some 
                                direct extension of tumor into the hilar 
                                lymph node, but also shows lymphatic 
                                space invasion in this area.  All of the 
                                separate lymph nodes are negative for 
                                tumor (pN1). 
    Distant metastasis (pM):  Could not evaluate, pMX. 
    Other findings:  Some intrapulmonary spread of tumor is identified 
    slide E8 with tumor within pulmonary parenchyma and lymphatic spaces 
    in the lung well away from the primary tumor.  Also areas of 
                     emphysema are noted and chronic bronchitis and a 
                     focal area of pulmonary infarction versus possible 
                     focal organizing pneumonia is identified in slide 
                     E9.  Some pulmonary hemorrhage and edema is noted 
                     in the middle lobe in slide E10.

The patient is a 64-year-old woman with a history of left breast mass. A core needle biopsy was performed. The specimen consists of two fragments of tan-pink tissue. The larger fragment measures 0.9 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm and the smaller fragment measures 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm. Microscopic description: The tumor is composed of cells arranged in cords and nests, with focal comedo necrosis. The tumor cells have high nucleus to cytoplasm ratio, vesicular chromatin, and conspicuous nucleoli. Mitotic figures are easily identified. Immunohistochemical stains show the tumor cells to be positive for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2 neu. The background shows extensive lymphocytic infiltration. No ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or invasive carcinoma is identified in the surrounding breast tissue.

1. ""Site"": left breast. Justification: The report mentions a left breast mass and the biopsy was performed on the left breast.
2. ""Laterality"": left. Justification: The tumor is located in the left breast, as stated in the report.
3. ""Histology"": Invasive ductal carcinoma. Justification: The report mentions the tumor cells are arranged in cords and nests with focal comedo necrosis, consistent with invasive ductal carcinoma.
4. ""Stage"": Not provided. Justification: The TNM stage cannot be determined from this report as it does not mention the size of the tumor, lymph node involvement, or metastasis.
5. ""Grade"": Grade III (High grade or poorly differentiated). Justification: The tumor cells have high nucleus to cytoplasm ratio, vesicular chromatin, and conspicuous nucleoli with easily identified mitotic figures, all of which are features of a high-grade tumor.

MACROSCOPIC 
F our specimens received: 
I: The first specimen is labelled' left lower lobe' and consists of a left lower lobe oflung measuring 
160 CSI) x 100 CAP) x 90 mm CML). The pleural surface is puckered on the anteromedial aspect of the 
superior portion of the lobe and underlying this there is a firm mass. This has been incised prior to 
reception in the laboratory . Otherwise the pleural surface is umemarkable. There are two suture lines 
extending from the hilum. One extends superiorly and measures 40 mm the other inferiorly and 
measures 35 mm. Sectioning reveals a large poorly circumscribed tumour mass underlying the area of 
pleural puckering described. Defining its dimensions macroscopically is difficult but it would be 
approximately 70 CSI) x 60 (AP) x 70 mm (ML). It is made difficult as the tumour merges 
imperceptibly with probable endogenous lipoid pneumonia in the surrounding parenchyma. The 
tumour mass extends from the anterior pleural surface to the posterior pleural surface and extends to 
within 10 mm of the bronchial resection margin. A discrete firm nodule is noted in the mid lateral 
portion of the lobe which measures 5 x 5 x 5 mm. This appears to be separate from the main tumour.

MICROSCOPIC 
I. Sections show a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. The tumour has a papillary architecture 
and includes areas with psammoma bodies and 'Orphan Annie' nuclei. There is a small component 
with features of rnicropapillary differentiation . Although this may represent a lung primary, special 
stains are being performed to exclude a thyroid or an ovarian primary. Surrounding the mass, there is a 
patchy lepidic growth pattern and carcinoma is identified both within the airspaces and lymphatics in 
the section from the normal lung. The nodule in the mid lateral portion of the lobe is a focus of tumour 
with a surrounding lepidic growth pattern. The lesion is subpleural and the tumour invades into the 
visceral pleural surface. There is possible focal surface involvement. Blood vessel and lymphatic 
invasion is present. No perineural permeation is seen. Adenocarcinoma is present within all the 
peribronchial lymph nodes including one at the bronchial resection margin. Extracapsular extension is 
noted. Also present at the bronchial resection margin, there is lymphatic permeation within the 
mucosa. No dysplasia is seen. There is insufficient normal lung parenchyma for assessment of 
abnormalities. 
2. Sections show a lymph node involved by metastatic adenocarcinoma. 
3. Sections show lymph nodes involved by metastatic adenocarcinoma. 
4. Sections show lymph nodes involved by metastatic adenocarcinoma. 
SUMMARY 
Left lower lobe and pulmonary vein, No.9 and No. 10 lymph nodes: 
A: Moderately differentiated papillary adenocarcinoma; special stains being performed; at least 70 mm 
in maximal dimension with extensive involvement of the surrounding lung including the section of  ""normal"" lung. 
B: Blood vessel and lymphatic invasion present but no perineural permeation is seen. 
C: Visceral pleural invasion identified ; bronchial margin involved Cmucosallymphatic permeation). 
D: Lymph node metastases within all sampled nodes. 
E: T4N2MX 
F: Non-neopla stic lung: Involved by carcinoma 
SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT 
The tumour cells are stains strongly for TIF 1 but are negative for thyroglobulin. Some patchy 
positivity is identified with progesterone receptor markers but no convincing positivity is seen with the 
oestrogen receptor markers. This immunohistochemical profile would support a diagnosis of primary 
pulmonary adenocarcinoma.

Clinical diagnosis and question 
Space-occupying lesion left lower lobe 56, (poorly differentiated large-cell, nonkeratinizing squamous cell carcinoma), 
status post asbestos exposure. 
REPORT ON FINDINGS 
Macroscopy 
1.) Left lower lobe: inflated, fixed left lower lobe of lung measuring 20 x 15 em at the base and up to 17 em in length, 
central bronchus resection plane located 0.3 em proximal to the bifurcation of 86. A 7 em long branched staple suture 
line runs in a ventrocaudal direction from the hilus. In the medioventral region over 56 a cusp-shaped part of the upper 
lobe measuring 4 x 1.5 x 1.2 em is attached, closed by a staple suture line. In the laterodorsal region over 56 and 
adjacent sections of 510, part of the parietal pleura, measuring 9.5 x 5.5 em, is mostly adhesive over an extensive area 
and loosely attached in parts at the margin. At the hilus are 3 mobile grayish-black nodes between 0.2 and 0.7 em in size. 
Ostium of 86 completely obstructed by endobronchial parts of a central, moderately solid, pale brownish, focally soft 
tumor, max. 6 em in size, located in 56, with unclear demarcation and extending right up to the ventral visceral pleura 
over 56 and to within 0.2 em of the hilar resection surface. Apparent central involvement of some grayish-black 
parabronchial nodes up to 1.5 em in size by the tumor. Macroscopically questionable infiltration of the attached part of 
the upper lobe, minimal distance from the resection plane of the pulmonary wedge after removal of the metal staple 
line 0.3 em. Parenchyma peripheral to the tumor in 56 and adjacent sections of 510 right up to the dorsal pleura and to 
the pleural adhesion area over 56, with unclear demarcation, shows diffuse induration and a brownish-yellow color. Rest 
of parenchyma inconspicuous. Medially in the attached fatty tissue close to the basal margin are 4 grayish-black nodes 
between 0.2 and 1.1 em in size. 
2.) Peribronchial tissue left: 0.9 em flat reddish tissue. 
3.) Hilar LN (station 10) left: 1.4 em grayish-black node or node part with some surrounding tissue. 
4.) Pulmonary ligament LN (station 9) left: 2.2 em grayish-black node with some surrounding tissue, section surfaces 
partly indurated and pale grayish-white suggestive of tumor. 
5.) Paraesophageal LN (station 8) left: two 2.5 em specimens of fatty tissue, containing 1 em node with section surfaces 
suggestive of tumor. 
6.) Paraaortie LN (station 6):1.2 em node part with some surrounding tissue. 
7.) Subaortie LN (aortopulmonary window) (station 5): two lesioned grayish-black nodes or node parts with 
some surrounding tissue, 1.5 and 0.8 em in size. 
 Examined: 
1.) Rapid section remains and resection margins of vessels and hilar nodes, tumor with remaining parenchyma, 
endobronchial tumor part in B6, tumor with ventral visceral pleura over S6, 3 sections ofhilar resection snrface

1.)). Hilar lymph nodes of the main preparation and lymph nodes of samples 6.) and 7.) with uncharacteristic 
reactive lesions, anthracotic pigment deposits and an old, nodular, cicatricially encapsulated area of necrosis 
(smnple 6.)). 
Remark/addendum: 
The tumor has obstrncted B6 at its bifurcation, continuously infiltrated para bronchial lymph nodes and extended 
focally to within at least 0.2 mm of the hilar resection surface. It has also grown across the pleural fissure 
initially and into the co-resected tissue from the upper lobe and has formed further lymph node metastases in 
samples 3.) -5.). The resection Jines of the bronchus and vessels, the resection plane of the wedge resection 
specimen from the upper lobe and the lymph nodes located at the hilus of the main preparation (sample 1)), the 
repeat resection specimen of sample 2.) and the lymph nodes of samples 6.) and 7.) are tumor-free. 
No asbestos bodies are found in the prepared section planes. However, very much further-reaching investigations, in 
particular dust analytical studies, are needed to settle the question of asbestos dust exposure.

SPECIMEN/BLOCK NUMBER-
EGFR Mutation :NOT DETECTED
Results reviewed by
The following polymorphism was detected :2361g>A.a demo co^rc (r ^4S $t` ^-^
(;-If -J?- 2JO
Sequencing of the entire coding region and splice junction sites of exons 18-21 of the EGFR gene revealed no previously published mutations or any
sequence changes that could result in amino acid changes. However, one or more polymorphic sequence changes were discovered in the EGFR gene.
These polymorphisms are interpreted as non-pathogenic because they do not lead to amino acid changes. These polymorphisms are not expected to
have any clinical significance. As 7% of patients who respond to EGFR inhibitors do not show mutations in exons 18-21 of EGFR gene, a negative result
does not preclude the possibility of a clinical response to EGFR inhibitors.
K„S Mutation Analysis
KRAS Mutation :DETECTED
(Abnormal) Results reviewed by
Based on sequence analysis ,K-Ras codon 12 GGT>GAT (GI2D) mutant was detected.
Lung Ca (NSCLC),ALK,FISH: SEE BELOW
Specimen Type: Paraffin Embedded Tumor Tissue
Clinical Indication: FISH study for oncology
Method : FISH
Total Cells : 50
Images Captured : 2
RESULT: NEGATIVE FOR ALK REARRANGEMENT [SEE COMMENT BELOW)
INTERPRETATION:
Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis did not reveal a rearrangement of the ALK gene. However, 1-3 additional copies of the ALK region were
observed in 80% of cells. The significance of additional copies of the ALK region is not dear.
In non-small cell lung carcinoma, overexpression of the AL.K kinase is seen most commonly through an inversion producing ELM4-ALK fusion protein. A
small proportion of tumors (approximately 5%) with ALK rearrangement demonstrated byother methods may be missed by this study. This test is
indicated as an aid in the assessment of patients for whom crizotinib (i.e. XALKORI) treatment is being considered. Correlation with clinical findings and
other laboratory studies is indicated.
Please expect the result of any other concurrent test in a separate report.
FISH test was performed using a break-apart probe specific for the ALK gene According to the manufacturers directional
insert, the cutoff value for ALK rearrangement is 15% of interphase cells in paraffin-embedded specimens. This assay has been approved by the U,S.
Food and Drug Administration.

puckers the overlying pleura, but chest wall invasion. and invasion into 
the upper lobe are not identified. However, a second tumor is identified 
more centrally in the upper lobe. This is separate from the RLL tumor, 
measures 3 em in greatest dimension, and shows similar histology to that 
of the RLL tumor. The tumor demonstrates extensive vascular invasion, 
including invasion of some larger vessels, and several pulmonary infarcts 
are noted in the upper lobe. Multiple peribronchial lymph nodes are 
involved by tumor, including by direct invasion of the RUL tumor. By 
immunohistochemistry, the tumor cells show strong cytoplasmic staining 
for 5/6, focal moderate staining for high and low molecular weight 
cytokeratin, and moderate to strong nuclear staining for p63. The tumor 
cells are negative for cytokeratin 7 and 20, and TTF-1. The morphological 
and immunohistochemical features are consistent with poorly 
differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Given the morphologic 
similarities between the RUL and RLL tumors and the extent of vascular 
invasion, the RUL tumor is strongly favored to represent a metastasis 
from the RLL tumor. The pathologic stage is therefore assessed to be 
pT2N1M1.

8. The specimen labeled with the patient's name and as ""LUNG: right lung 
bronchial resection with ribs 4 & 5/QS"". The specimen is received fresh 
and subsequently placed in to 10% buffered formalin .. It consists of a 
right lung: upper, middle and lower lobes, with overall dimensions of 
-1 .• 0 em SI x 21.0 em ML x 7.5 em AP. A small portion of unremarkable 4th 
.d 5th ribs are identified on the upper lobe, measuring 5.0 x 1.4 x 0.7 
em and 7. 4 x 1. 4 x Q. 8 em. The' pleural surfaces of all three lobes are 
homogeneously purple and congested, showing diffuse black pigmentation. 
Cross sections of the right upper lobe reveal three separate, poorly 
defined lesions. The largest measuring 3.0 x 3.0 x 2.3 em, located within 
the ?anterior segment. The cut surface of this lesion is homogeneously 
white and firm. Further sections·show gross invasion into the bronchus 
and adjacent lymph nodes. This tumor is located -1.5 em from the 
bronchial resection margin, and 0.6 em from the closest pleural surface. 
The two smaller lesions are located 2.0 em beneath the ribs, within the 
anterior aspect. Both lesions are homogeneously tan, solid and grossly 
appear to have a red hemorrhagic center measuring 1.2 x 0.7 x 0.7 em and 
1.5 x 1.0 x 1.0 em. The distance between the two smaller lesions is 0.6 
em. Both lesions are located -s.o em from the bronchial resection margin 
and 1.1 em from the closest pleural surface. The remaining parenchyma of 
the right upper lobe is homogeneously dark brown and unremarkable. 
Cross. sections of the right middle lobe are homogeneously dark brown, 
spongy and unremarkable. 
Within the superior segment of the right lower lobe, a well-circumscribed 
tumor is noted measuring s.o x 4.0 x 4.4 em. The cut surface of the 
tumor is homogeneously white and firm; located 5.5 em from the bronchial 
resection margin. cross sections of the tumor show that it abuts the 
pleural surface, causing ""pleural puckering"". Further sections reveal 
gross invasion into the pleura. Approximately 1.5 em from the larger 
mor, a smaller calcified nodule is noted (within the base of the right 
-vwer lobe) measuring 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.2 em. The remaining parenchyma of 
Page: 5 of 10 
 the right lower lobe is homogeneously dark brown and otherwise 
unremarkable. 
Multiple lymph nodes are noted throughout the right lung, ranging from 
o·. 3 to 2. a em. Four pieces of tumor and four pieces of normal lung 
parenchyma have been taken for tissue banking. The bronchial resection 
margin has been removed (en face) and submitted for intraoperative

Gross Description: 
A. Received fresh is a single ovoid soft tissue fragment consistent with a lymph node, 1 x 0.9 x 0.5 cm. The specimen is 
submitted in toto in one block for frozen section. 
B. Received fresh is an irregularly shaped soft tissue fragment, 1 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm. The specimen is bisected and submitted in 
toto in one block for frozen section. 
C. Received fresh are multiple irregularly shaped soft tissue fragments, 2.5 x 2 x 0.5 cm in aggregate. The specimen is 
submitted in toto in one block for frozen section. 
D. Received in formalin is a single ovoid soft tissue fragment, 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm in greatest dimension. The specimen is 
bisected and submitted in toto in one block. 
E. Received in formalin is an ovoid soft tissue fragment, 1.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm in greatest dimension. The specimen is bisected 
and submitted in toto in one block. 
F. Received fresh is a lung resection specimen, which is anatomically distorted, with multiple staple lines. The pleural 
surface is intact, pale purple-blue without any areas of obvious puckering. There is a main stem bronchus extending from 
the specimen for a distance of 4 cm. Surrounding this bronchus are multiple subcarinal lymph nodes. Attached to the 
anterior lateral surface of the specimen are three ribs. The lung measures 21 x 14 x 8 cm in greatest dimension. The 
attached rib measures 12.5 cm in length and 7.5 cm in aggregate diameter. Upon opening the specimen along the 
bronchial tree, there is a cystic mass replacing the majority of the lung parenchyma. It measures 9.3 x 8.5 x 8 cm in 
greatest dimension. The cystic mass is unilocular. The wall of the mass is at most 2.5 cm in thickness. Centrally located 
within the cyst is hemorrhagic and necrotic fluid. Upon removing the fluid, a large papillary necrotic mass is identified 
measuring at most 5 cm in greatest dimension. This lesion grossly appears to approach the pleura at the right superior 
lateral aspect close to the ribs and is grossly at a distance of 0.1 cm from the inked pleural surface. Grossly, this lesion 
appears to focally involve the surrounding portion of rib in the central portion of the length of the rib and is at least 2.5 cm 
from the anterior bone resection margin and at least 2 cm from the lateral posterior bone resection margin. The 
pulmonary parenchyma surrounding the cavitary lesion is hemorrhagic and consolidated. No other lesions are grossly 
identified. Sections are submitted as follows:

Site: The primary tumor is located in the right lung. This is mentioned in the preoperative diagnosis and gross description sections of the report.

Laterality: The tumor is in the right side of the body. This is indicated in the site category above.

Histology: The tumor is a type of lung cancer, but it is not specified what kind. This information is not provided in the report.

Stage: The tumor has lymph node involvement (N1) but no arterial or large vessel invasion. Therefore, based on the TNM staging system for lung cancer, the stage would be at least T1b N1 M0. However, since the size of the primary tumor is not provided, a more specific stage cannot be determined.

Grade: The grade of the tumor is not provided in the report.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. The specimen consists of a 193 gm, 18.2 x 11.5 x 2.5 cm lobe of
lung displaying a 5.5 cm in length linear staple line superior to the
bronchus. The bronchial resection margin is removed en face and
submitted for frozen section diagnosis and subsequent routine
histology in cassette FsA. The remaining pleural surface is tan-pink
and smooth with a 1.0 x 1.0 cm area of induration and puckering along
the lateral aspect. The area of pleural puckering is inked blue. The
linear staple line is removed, and the underlying parenchyma is inked
black.
Sectioning reveals a 1.6 x 1.6 x 0.8 cm, tan-yellow to white,
granular, poorly demarcated mass underlying the aforementioned area of
pleural puckering and induration. The mass approaches the pleural
surface. The mass is 4.3 cm from the bronchial resection margin, and
3.6 cm from the closest vascular resection margin. The mass is 4.6 cm
from the closest staple line surface.
The remaining lung parenchyma is tan-pink to red and unremarkable. No
areasof congestion, consolidation, or emphysematous change are
grossly appreciated. Sectioning through the peribronchial region
reveals multiple dark black, rubbery, anthracotic lymph nodes.
Representative sections are submitted as follows: Al- vascular
resection margin; A2-A3- entire staple line resection margin en face;
A4-A5- entire mass with overlying pleura and adjacent uninvolved
parenchyma; A6- uninvolved lung parenchyma; A7- peribronchial lymph

LUNG 
Clinical Details: 
NSCL Ca (left hilar). 
Four specimens received: 
A; LEFT LUNG 
Macroscopy: 
The specimen is labelled ""left lung"" and consists of a lung measuring 
195 x 110 x 75 mm. There is a polypo id tumour protruding into the lumen of 
the main bronchus but not obviously involving the resection margin . Some of 
the bronchi appear dilated and are filled with mucus. Present just below 
the hilum and surrounding bronchi and blood vessels is the mass. It is 
growing into the bronchus as a polypoid mass. It involves the adjacent 
lymph node. It measures approx imately 32 mm in maximal dimension. It 
has a firm pale appearance. Some adhesions are identified around the base 
of the lung. [Sections taken: bronchial resection margin-AI; vascular 
resection margin- A2; peribronchial lymph nodes A3-A4; tumour A5-A7; adjacent 
lung-AS] 
B; HILAR LYMPH MODE 
Macroscopy : 
•  The specimen is labelled Mhilar lymph nodeM and consists of a node with 
S'Jrroun~ing fibro-fatty tissue measuring 9 x 6 x 4 mm, [Bisected and blocke 
in toto, Bl]. 
c: NO.5 NODE 
Macroscopy: 
The specimen is labelled MNo. 5 node"" and consists of a lymph 
node measuring 18 x 15 x 8 mm. [Blocked in toto, 2 T.S.-CIJ. 
0: NO.7 NODE 
Macroscopy: 
The specimen Is labelled MNo. 7 nodeM and consists of a lymph node 
measuring 20 x 10 x 4 mm. [Bisected and blocked in toto, 01}. [  
Microscopy -Sped mens A-D: 
Sections of the tumour show moderately differentiated keratlnising 
squamous cell carcinoma involving left main bronchus and infiltrating 
around adjacent pulmonary vessels and Into the pulmonary parenchyma. 
The tumour extends medially through pleura into adherent fibrofatty soft 
tissue containing nerve fibres. No perineural invasion Is seen, 
but the tumour extends up to the surgical rese~ion margin at this 
point and residual microscopic disease cannot be excluded. One of 
five peribronchial lymph nodes contains metastatic carcinoma. 
The bronchial resection margin is clear of tumour. 
Sections of adjacent non-tumour lung show an area of scarring in 
relation to arteries showing evidence of recanalisation, interpreted 
as likely to be consequent to vascular changes related to tumour at 
• 
 the lung hilum. 
The hilar lymph node and lymph node designated number 5 show no 
evidence of malignancy. Metastatic squamous carcinoma is present 
in the separately submitted lymph node referenced as number 7. 
Diagnosis: 
Left lung: Moderately differentiated keratinising squamous 
carcinoma with extra-pleural soft tissue extension, 
metastatic to peribronchial and number 7 lymph nodes. 
cc:  
Pathologist : DR_ Registrar: DR 
Validated by DR 
Further sections of pericardium, i I soft tissue and pleura have 
been submitted for histology (EBl-3). Tumour is present on the surface of 
mediastinal pleura and mediastinal soft tissue adjacent to the resected 
portion of pericardium, associated with strands of cardiac muscle at this 
site. 
Therefore, as stated in the original report, the possibility of residual 
microscopic tumour in the mediastinum Is not excluded on histologic 
grounds.

Comments
The history of ""back lower lobe squamous cell carcinoma"" is noted.
There is however no prior material. identified in our files for
review and comparison. The two small subpleural nodules identified grossly, separate from
the malignancy, are both areas of fibrosis containing some
histiocytes and reactive alveolar lining cells, possibly
representing areas of resold pneumonia.

Two specimens submitted. 
1: The first specimen is labelled ""right upper lobe"" and consists of a right upper lobe of lung measuring 
115 x 100 x 35 mm. A solid mass is palpable in the upper lateral segment of the lung (segment 2). The 
pleura overlying this mass appears puckered and there is an attached piece of pleura measuring 
approximately 120 mm in length. On sectioning of the lung a tumour measuring 28 x 25 x 40 mm is 
seen. It has a cream and grey-black cut surface. The margins of the tumour appear ilTegular. The

adenocarcinoma with extensive tumor necrosis where the epicenter appears to be at the
junction of the right mainstem and upper lobe bronchus with extension along the lower lobebronchus.The firm nodal mass which was adherent to the bronchus, when removed,
demonstrates apparent matted lymph node tissue involved by metastatic adenocarcinoma with
extensive involvement of the adjacent soft tissue as well as with perineural and
angiolymphatic invasion present.Tumor involves the surface in this area. Clinical
correlation is recommended to ascertain whether there was direct involvement of other
mediastinal structures in this area.The bronchial margin does demonstrate carcinoma

lymphnodeor lymph node tissue involved by direct extension .Thisareais adherent to the
bronchial wall and when removed measures 4.5 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm. Two other hilar lymph nodes
are identified, 2 and 2.5 cm in greatest dimension. The lung is sectioned longitudinally
along the axis of the bronchial margin revealing a rigt upper lobe mass extending into the
main bronchus with lateral extension along the lower lobe bronchus measuring 5.5 x 3 x 5.5
cm.There is direct extension into peribronchial lymph nodes, There is purulent material
which fill the distal bronchi and necrotic material is noted within stepsections of the
tumor. Thereis a small skipareaalong the lower lobe bronchus where a separate
submucosal mass is noted measuring 1 cm. This may just represent direct extension around
the bronchus. The lower lobe has ayellowish-brown color possibly representing obstructive
pneumonia .A portion of non-necrotic tumor is provided to the tissue bank coordinator with
a weight of 230 mg noted. No other discrete masses are identified .Additional sections

CELL CARCINOMA (2.0 CM) WITH EXTENSIVE NECROSIS.
Dictated by
The specimen is received fresh, labeled with the patient's name,
and designated right upper lobe. It consists of an
uppero e of lung, weighing 160 gm and measuring 14.0 x 11.0 x2.0 UNNOcm.A firm nodule is palpated on the surface opposite the hilum. The
pleura overlying this area is'non-puckered and normal appearing. The
remaining pleura is focally hemorrhagic, glistening and with extensive
anthracotic pigmentation. Sectioning in the area of the palpated
mass, shows an ill-defined gray-white and gritty mass, measuring 2.0
cm in greatest dimension. Grossly, this mass is located 0.6 cm from
the pleura surface and does not appear to involve a bronchus. The
mass is well-defined and freely movable from the adjacent lung
parenchyma. The arteries and vessels at the hilum appear grossly
normal. The pleura overlying the tumor is inked black. A
representative frozen section is taken. Hilar lymph nodes are not
present in the specimen. The remaining lung is pink-red with focal
hemorrhage and is crepitant. Representative tumor and normal tissue
are submitted for future studies to tumor bank. The remaining tumor
is submitted in its entirety.

No details received. 
MACROSCOPIC 
Two specimens received. 
I: The specimen is labelled ""right upper lobe"" and consists of an upper lobe measuring 150 x 85 x 50 
mm in the fresh state. 15 mm lateral to the bronchial resection margin and hilum, there is a nodular, 
firm subpleural mass measuring 20 mm in diameter. On sectioning, the mass is pale, fleshy and 
measures 27 mm in diameter. It underlies a proximal bronchus but is well clear of the bronchial 
resection margins. [Sections taken; bronchial resection margin and hilar and peribronchial lymph 
nodes, I A; tumour with overlying pleura, IB-IO; section of uninvolved lung, I EJ 
2: The specimen is labelled ""hilar lymph node"" and consists of two pieces of blackened lymph node, 
each measuring 14 and 8 mm in maximal dimensions. The largest piece is bisected. [Wrapped and 
blocked in 2A]. 
MICROSCOPY 
1: Sections show a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. The tumour shows areas of clear 
cell change. The lesion is subpleura l but definite pleural invasion is not identified. Special stains will 
be performed to assess this. The tumour is also in the region of a bronchus. In this area there appears 
to be an in situ component. There is focal blood vessel invasion but no lymphatic permeation is seen. 
Perineural permeation is identified. The lesion is well clear of the bronchial resection margin. No 
lymph node metastases are seen. The adjacent lung shows evidence of emphysema. 
2: A deposit of poorly differentiated carcinoma is present within the lymph node cortex. 
SUMMARY 
Righi upper lobe and hilar lymph nodes: 
I: Poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma; 27 mm in maximal dimension. 
2: Blood vessel and perineural invasion present but no lymphatic permeation seen. 
3: No definite pleural invasion identified; clear of bronchial margin. 
4: Hilar lymph node metastases.

SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT 
Focal neuroendocrine positivity is identified within the tumour with chromogranin, synaptophys in and 
CO 56. The positive areas appear to be in the bener differentiated squamous areas. Therefore the 
tumour is a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma showing focal neuroendocrine 
differentiation.

 KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS  
 
 
Referring Physician:  
Body Site: Right upper lobe of lung Specimen Type: Slides  
Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma  RESULTS: Positive for a p.G12V (c.35G>T) mutation in codon 12 of the KRAS gene.  INTERPRETATION:  
Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to correlate with poor prognosis and resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies in patients w ith non- small- cell lung cancer.  
 COMMENT:  
KRAS mutations occur in 15-30% of non- small- cell lung cancer (NSCLC)  
patients and are strongly associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking history.  This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene; based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low percentage of cells may not be detected.  
 This test is valid ated for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and 
codon 13 mutations in fresh, frozen, or formalin- fixed paraffin  
embedded tissue. In particular the test performance has been established in samples of colorectal cancer and non -small cell lung  
carcinoma which h arbor these mutations, although several other 
tissues are also known to harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix, etc.).   METHOD/LIMITATIONS:  
Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is  
selected fo r analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified  
 and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to 
exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13; primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel  
electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

EGFR Mutation Analysis  
 
 Referring Physician:  
 Body Site: Right upper lobe of lung  Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma  
 RESULTS: No mutation detected . 
 INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified in the sample provided for analysis. Fewer than 5% of non- small cell lung carcinoma  
patients without identifiable mutations are reported to be  
responsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies.   COMMENT : Forty percent (40%) or more tumor cellularity is optimal  
for this mutation analysis. The sample submitted showed 4% tumor cellularity upon pathologist review  A frequently occurring sequence change 2361G>A (Q787Q) was identified. This polymorphism is known not to have clinical significance.  
 Mutations in the tyrosine domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with differential  
responsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapies. The objective response rate among patients with a sensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%.  This assay analyzes exons 18 -21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain; 
based on the current literature, most mutations in non- small- cell 
lung carcinoma (NSCLC) are expected to occur in these exons.  
Mutations present in less than 10-20% of extracted DNA may not be detected by this method. Mutation status in a sample may change during tumor progression or the course of therapy; therefore, this result cannot be used to infe r the presence or absence of a mutation  
in another sample or sub-sample obtained from this tumor.  This test is validated for non- small cell lung carcinoma. The  
clinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types  
is unknown.  
 METHOD/LIMITAT ION:  
Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is  
selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the samples, quantified  
and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to 
exons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by  
bi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary gel  
electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

Left lobe lobectomy upper. 
MACROSCOPIC 
Two specimens submitted. 
1: The specimen is labelled ""left upper lobe"" and consists of a left upper lobe of lung measuring 220 x 
90 x 17 mm. A large area of parietal pleural adhesion is noted on the anterolateral surface. Beneath 
this a firm mass is palpable within the anterior segment. On sectioning a mass is confirmed within the 
lung. The mass measures 40 x 17 x 32 mm and has a cream to tan cut surface with black streaking. 
The tumour lies adjacent to the area of thickened and adherent pleura. The tumour is over 25 mm away 
from the medial pleural surface and is well clear of the posterior pleural surface. The tumour is at least 
40 mm away from the bronchial resection margin. The uninvolved lung tissue appears unremarkable. 
[lA, bronchial resection margin; IB, peribronchial lymph nodes; 1 C, tumour with adherent lateral 
pleura; ID, adjacent medial pleural margin; IE-IF, further sections through tumour; IG, uninvolved 
lung]. 
2: The specimen is labelled ""lymph node No.5"" and consists of a single fragment of cream fatty tissue 
containing grey-black lymph nodes. The specimen measures 25 x 18 x 7 mm. No obvious 
is noted on sectioning. [Bisected and BIT, 2A-B]. 
MICROSCOPIC 
1: Sections show a moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma which invades into the 
overlying adherent parietal pleura but appears clear of the soft tissue resection margin. Definite 
vascular or lymphatic invasion is not identified. Metastatic adenocarcinoma is present in one of the 
peribronchial lymph nodes with transcapsular extension into adjacent hilar fibrofatty tissue and 
perineural and intraneural invasion in this region. The bronchial resection margin is clear of 
malignancy but shows several foci of squamous metaplasia and low-grade dysplasia. Distant lung 
parenchyma shows focal organising pneumonia, congestion and emphysema. 
2: Sections show partial replacement of the lymph nodes by metastatic carcinoma with transcapsular 
extension into the adjacent fibrofatty tissue. 
SUMMARY 
Left upper lobectomy and lymph node No 5: 
Moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, 40 mm in diameter. 
Invasion of parietal pleura present. 
No vascular invasion identified. 
Metastatic adenocarcinoma present in peribronchial and No 5 lymph nodes. 
Perineural and intraneural invasion present in hilar soft tissue.
