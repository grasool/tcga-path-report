There are two tumor foci, one of peripheral\nzone and one of transition zone origin. The dominant tumor focus is located in the right anterolateral, right lateral, right\nposterolateral, right posterior, mid posterior, left posterior, left posterolateral, left lateral and left anterolateral peripheral zone with\nextension into the transition zone. This tumor focus measures 4.0 x 3.0 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and it is\npresent in three cross sections and extensively in the apex and base regions. This tumor focus exhibits multifocal extraprostatic\nextension and multifocal extension to the margin of resection. This tumor focus extensively invades both seminal vesicles\nincluding intra and extraprostatic portions and perivesicular soft tissue. The second tumor focus is located in the right and left\ntransition zone. This tumor focus measures 2.0 x 1.0 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in three cross\nsections, extensively in the apex and focally in the base region. This tumor focus is of lower histologic grade (Gleason score\n6/3+3) and it is confined to the prostate.\nPlease refer to the previous report for the diagnosis of the pelvic lymph nodes.\nGROSS :DESCRIPTION\n(C) PROSTATE, SEMINAL VESICLES - A prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles and attached segments of right and\nleft vasa deferentia.\nThe prostate gland (5.3 x 3.5 x 3.6 cm, 56 gm, postfixation) has the usual shape. A nodule is palpated in the right mid and\nright base regions.

However, it can be inferred to be the breast based on the context.\n* Laterality: The laterality (left or right side) of the breast is also not provided in the report.\n* Histology: The histology of the tumor is invasive ductal carcinoma, which means the cancer has developed from the milk ducts and has invaded the surrounding tissue.\n* Stage: The stage of the cancer is T2N1M0, which indicates that the tumor is greater than 2 cm in size, has spread to at least one axillary lymph node, but has not yet metastasized to other parts of the body.\n* Grade: The grade of the cancer is not provided in the report. However, it can be inferred that it is a high-grade tumor based on the fact that it has invaded the surrounding tissue.\n* Behavior: The behavior of the cancer is malignant, meaning it is capable of spreading to other parts of the body and causing harm.\n\nThe reason for the discrepancy between pathology and radiology reports could be due to differences in interpretation or measurement of the tumor size, location, and involvement of lymph nodes. Without access to both reports, it is difficult to provide a definitive justification for the discrepancy."

The tumor is located in the right posterolateral, right\nposterior, mid posterior, and left posterior peripheral zone. The tumor focus measures 2.5 x 0.9 cm in the largest cross-sectional\ndimension, and it is present in the three cross sections of the prostate, extensively in the apex and focally in the base region. The\ntumor is confined to the prostate. The margins of resection are free of tumor.\nGROSS DESCRIPTION\n(D) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A specimen consisting of a prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles and\nattached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.\nThe prostate gland (5.2 x 2.5 x 3.8 cm, 36 grams, post-fixation) has the usual shape. The soft tissue present along the\nposterolateral aspect of the prostate is abundant and more extensive along the right side. An area of firmness is noted on the\nmidline posterior surface of the prostate. Serial cross sections after fixation demonstrate an area of tumor in the mid posterior\nregion of the two cross sections of the prostate.\nThe seminal vesicles and segments of vasa deferentia are grossly free of tumor.\nSECTION CODE: D1-D3, right seminal vesicle and segment of right vas deferens from the base towards the tip; D4, D5,\nleft seminal vesicle and segment of left vas deferens from the base towards the tip; D6, prostatic base right border; D7-D9,\nprostatic base right posterior border; D10-D12, prostatic base central portion; D13, D14, prostatic base left border; D15, D16,\nprostatic base left posterior border; D17, D18, apex anterior; D19, D20, apex left; D21, D22, apex posterior; D23, D24, apex right;\nD25-D36, sections of the three cross sections of the prostate according to specimen radiograph.\nThe anterior aspect of the prostate is inked in green, left surface in red, right surface in yellow and posterior surface in\nblack. Blue ink (D7, 8, 10-12, 19-24, 27, 28, 32 and 36) and orange ink (D31) denote surfaces that do not represent a true margin\nof resection.

Specimen (s) Received\nA:Prostate, radical resection (fresh)\nClinical History\nThe patient is a year-old man with prostate cancer, Gleason grade 3+3.\nGross Description\nThe specimen is received fresh in one part, labeled with the patient's name and medical record number\nand \"prostate and seminal vesicles, left ampulla single short stitch; right seminal vesicle single long.\" It\nconsists of three separate pieces of tissue. One is the prostate gland, the second is the left ampulla (as\ndesignated by the surgeon with a single short stitch), and the third piece Is the right seminal vesicle (as\ndesignated by the surgeon with a single long stitch). The prostate will be described first. The prostate\ngland measures 4 cm from apex to base, 6 cm from medial to lateral, and 4 cm from anterior to\nposterior. The exterior of the gland Is roughened and pink-tan. Focal cautery markings are seen along\nthe base/bladder margin. Sutures are present along the anterior midline. Tiny metal staples are also\nfound embedded. There is a left seminal vesicle/vas deferens bundle attached, measuring 1.7 x 2 x 0.6\ncm. The right seminal vesicle/vas deferens bundle is not attached; as noted by the surgeon, they were\ndetached intraoperatively and will be described below. The left seminal vesicle/vas deferens bundle Is\nsoft, pink-tan, and whorled and has no discrete lesions. The right anterior surface of the gland Is inked\nIn green, the left anterior surface Is inked in blue, and the posterior surface is inked in black. The\nspecimen Is bisected roughly perpendicular to the urethral channel, and two fresh 6-mm punch biopsies\nare taken for research purposes. The two halves of the specimen are then glued, and the prostate is\nfixed prior to further sectioning. Following fixation, the apical and bladder margins are removed, and\nthe remainder of the gland is serially sectioned, from apex to base, into three serial slices. The serial\nslices reveal central and transitional zones composed of firm, slightly lobulated, pink-tan, and partially\ncystic tissue surrounded by firmer, white-tan, striated tissue. The periphery is composed of a thinner\nrim of softer, semi-porous, light tan tissue along the posterior surface. One suspicious lesion Is seen in\nthe right half of serial slices 1 and 2 and 3. This suspicious lesion is firm yellow-tan, and irregular and\nmeasures 0.7 cm in greatest dimension. Following further dissection and submission of tissue for\npathologic evaluation, serial slice 3 is taken for tissue banking/research purposes.\nThe second piece of tissue, which the surgeon designates as left ampulla with a single short stitch, is\nfirm, irregular, and pink-tan, weighs 1 gm, and measures 2 x 1 x 0.5 cm. The external surface of the\nleft ampulla is inked blue.

The tumor is located in the right lateral, right\nposterolateral, right posterior, mid posterior, left posterior, left posterolateral and left lateral peripheral zone. The tumor focus\nmeasures 3.0 x 1.4 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension, and it is present in the two cross sections of the prostate and\nextensively in the apex and base regions. The tumor exhibits extensive, multifocal extraprostatic extension. Areas of\nextraprostatic extension include the right and left posterolateral surface of the prostate, right and left posterior surface of the\nprostate, right and posterior apex, base region anterior to the left seminal vesicle and left superior neurovascular bundle. On the\nleft superior neurovascular bundle, at the site of extraprostatic extension, tumor is present at the inked margin of resection. The\nextent of marginal involvement in this region is less than 1.0 mm. In other regions, carcinoma is present at less than 0.1 mm from\nthe inked margin of resection (posterior apex and bladder neck region). The tumor invades both seminal vesicles including\nextraprostatic portion of the right and left seminal vesicles, and intraprostatic portion of the left seminal vesicle. Involvement of\nperivesicular soft tissue is also present.\nPlease refer to the previous report for the diagnosis of the pelvic lymph nodes.\nGROSS. DESCRIPTION\n(A) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A specimen consisting of a prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles and\nattached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.\nThe prostate gland (4.1 x 3.4 x 3.0 cm, 24 grams ,post-fixation) has the usual shape .The soft tissue present along the left\nposterolateral aspect of the prostate is scant ,but slightly more abundant than along the right side. A nodule is palpated in the left\napex and right side of the prostate .Serial cross sections after fixation demonstrate areas suspicious for tumor in the right side of\nthe two cross sections of the prostate.

The\ndominant tumor focus is located in the left anterolateral, left lateral and left posterolateral peripheral zone with extension into the\nleft transition zone. This tumor focus measures 2.0 x 0.8 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in the two\ncross-sections of the prostate and extensively in the apex and base. In the left superior neurovascular bundle region this tumor\nfocus extends into extraprostatic tissue (6.0 mm). The margins of resection are free of tumor. The second tumor focus is located\nin the right transition zone. This tumor focus measures 1.4 x 1.2 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and is present in two\ncross-sections and extensively in the apex and base. This tumor focus is of lower histologic grade (Gleason score 7/3+4) and\nconfined to the prostate. The margins of resection are free of tumor.\nPlease refer to the previous report for the diagnosis of the pelvic lymph nodes.\nGROSS..

The\ndominant tumor focus and the one of the highest histologic grade is located in the right and left transition zone. This tumor focus\nmeasures 3.0 x 1.5 cm in the largest cross -sectional dimension, and it is present in four cross sections and extensively in the\napical region .This tumor focus exhibits predominately Gleason grades 4 and 3. A minor (tertiary )component of Gleason grade 5\nis also present. This tumor exhibits focal extraprostatic extension (less than 1 .0 mm) in the right anterior surface of the prostate\nand extends to the margin of resection in the anterior apical region. The extent of marginal involvement is 6.0 mm .The two\nperipheral zone foci are located in the left posterolateral and right lateral peripheral zone. The tumor located in the left\nposterolateral peripheral zone measures 0.8 x 0 .4 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension, and it is present in the first cross\nsection of the prostate .The third tumor focus is located in the right lateral peripheral zone. This tumor measures 0.5 x 0.2 cm in\nthe largest cross-sectional dimension ,and it is present in one cross section. The non-dominant tumor foci are of lower histologic\ngrade (Gleason score 6/3 + 3) and are confined to the prostate with negative margins.\nGROSS DESCRIPTION\n(A) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A specimen consisting of a prostate ,attached right and left seminal vesicles and\nattached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.\nThe prostate gland (2.5 x 2. 2 x 4.0 cm ,31 grams ,post fixation )has the usual shape .The soft tissue present along the\nright and left posterolateral aspects of the prostate appears symmetrical .A palpable and visible nodule is observed in the left mid\nregion of the prostate .Serial cross sections after fixation demonstrate firm areas consistent with tumor in the right transition zone\nand right peripheral zone of the first three of the four cross sections of the prostate.\nThe seminal vesicles and segments of vasa deferentia are grossly free of tumor.\nSECTION CODE: Al, A2, base of right seminal vesicle and right vas deferens ;A3, A4, base of left seminal vesicle and\nleft vas deferens ;A5, prostatic base ,right border ;A6, A7 , prostatic base ,right posterior border ;A8, A9, prostatic base ,central\nportion; Al0, prostatic base ,left border ;Al 1, A12, prostatic base ,left posterior border ;A13, A14 , apex anterior ;A15, apex left; Page: 3\nSpecimen Date/Time:\nA16-A18, apex posterior ;A19, apex right ;A20-A35, sections of the four cross sections of the prostate according to specimen\nradiograph.\nThe anterior aspect of the prostate is inked in green ,left surface in red, right surface in yellow and posterior surface in\nblack.\nSNOMED CODES\nT-92000, M-Y1973\nEntire report and diagnosis completed by:\n------END OF REPORT------\nDiagnosis oiscre .-.\nPrimary Tumor SiteDi:creparcy\nDi,p-p.\nPrior Malignancy fl,;tory \"\nDualJStia- ch rono ;rsPn:naryN\n.irclc",

The largest tumor focus although not the one of the highest histologic grade (Gleason score 5/3+2) located in the right and\nleft transition zone. This tumor focus measures 2.7 x 1.3 cm in the largest cross sectional dimension and it is present in four cross\nsections and focally in the apical region. This tumor focus is confined to the prostate and the margins of resection are free of\ntumor. The second tumor focus is located in the left lateral, left posterolateral, left posterior, mid posterior and right posterior\nperipheral zone. This tumor focus measures 2.2 x 1.5 cm in the largest cross sectional dimension and it is present in three cross\nsections, extensively in the apex and focally in the base region. This tumor focus is a high grade carcinoma (Gleason score 4+5)\nand is associated with an increased lymphocytic infiltrate. The tumor focus exhibits extraprostatic extension in the left apex and left\nposterolateral aspect of the prostate. Extraprostatic extension is present in two separate sections and the added length of\nextraprostatic tumor is 9.0 mm. At the site of extraprostatic extension the margins of resection are free of tumor. This tumor focus\nfocally extends to less than 0.1 mm from the margin of resection in the apex. This tumor focus invades the intraprostatic portion of\nthe left seminal vesicle.\nDue to the presence of distortion in areas of the tumor close to the margins of resection in the apex and the presence of a marked\nlymphocytic infiltrate, immunoperoxidase studies for keratin, lymphocyte marker and neuroendocrine differentiation markers were\nperformed. Cytokeratin highlights tumor which is seen focally approaching but not at the margins of r section. The lymphocytic\ninfiltrate is a mixture of both CD20 positive B lymphocytes and CD5 positive T lymphocytes with a pr dominance of the latter. The\ntumor is negative for synaptophysin but a few scattered neoplastic cells are positive for chromograni supporting the presence of\nfocal minimal neuroendocrine differentiation. Page: 4\n(D) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A specimen consisting of a prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles and\nattached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.\nThe prostate gland (4.5 x 2.5 x 4.5 cm, 40 grams, post-fixation) has the usual shape.

Both tumor foci are located in the peripheral zone. The\ndominant tumor focus is located in the left lateral, left posterolateral, left posterior, mid-posterior, right posterior, right posterolateral\nand right lateral peripheral zone. This tumor focus measures 3.8 x 1.8 cm in largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in\nthe two cross-sections of the prostate and extensively in the apex and base. The tumor exhibits extraprostatic extension on the left\nposterolateral surface of the prostate and right and left superior neurovascular bundle regions. The tumor extends to the right\nbladder neck margin of resection. The area of the positive margin is cauterized and the added length of the cauterized margin on\nthe right base is 4.0 mm. The second tumor focus is located in the right anterolateral and right lateral peripheral zone. This tumor\nfocus measures less than 0.1 x less than 0.1 cm in largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in the first cross-section and\nfocally in the apex. The non-dominant tumor focus is of lower histologic grade and confined to the prostate with negative margins.\nGROSS .DESCRIPTION\n(E) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A specimen consisting of a prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles and\nattached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.\nThe prostate gland (5.0 x 2.5 x 4.0 cm, 28.0 grams, post-fixation) has the usual shape.

The dominant tumor focus\nis considered of peripheral zone origin. This tumor focus involves predominantly the right side the prostate. The tumor involves\nthe right posterolateral ,right lateral ,right anterolateral ,right anterior ,mid anterior ,left anterior, left anterolateral, left lateral and left\nposterolateral peripheral zone with extension into the right and left transition zone .This tumor focus measures 3.9 x 2 .4 cm in the\nlargest cross -sectional dimension and it involves the three cross sections of the prostate ,and extensively the apex and base. The\ntumor extends into extraprostatic tissue at multiple sites including the left apex ,right anterolateral surface, right base. The added\nlength of extraprostatic extension is 3.0 mm. The tumor invades at the base of the prostate thick smooth muscle bundles\nconsistent with microscopic bladder neck invasion. It should be noted that microscopic bladder neck invasion is considered pT3a.\nThe margins of resection are free of tumor.\nThe second tumor focus is located in the left transition zone .This tumor focus measures 1.5 x 0.2 cm in greatest cross-sectional\ndimension ,and involves one cross section of the prostate ,and focally the base. The third tumor focus is located in the left\ntransition zone ,exclusively in the apex. This tumor focus measures 0.4 x 0 .2 cm in largest cross sectional dimension ,and it is\npresent in one apical section. The non -dominant tumor foci are of lower histologic grade and are confined to the prostate with\nnegative margins.\nImmunohistochemical stains with ERG (E27, E43 ,E49) are negative. These results are non-contributory towards supporting\nmultiple tumor foci of different zonal origin.\nPT/JH/rgw\nDD: 1/24/13\n1/24/2013 11:16 AM\nGROSS DESCRIPTION\n(E) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A specimen consisting of a prostate ,attached right and left seminal vesicles and\nattached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.\nThe prostate gland (4.5 x 3.0 x 4.2 cm , 48.0 grams ,post-fixation) has the usual shape .The soft tissue present along the Page: 4 KKA046-PATH\nSpecimen Date Time :12/27/2012\nright posterolateral aspect of the prostate appears more abundant than along the left side .Serial cross sections after fixation\ndemonstrate an area consistent with tumor within the right side of the three cross sections of the prostate.

The tumor is located in the right anterolateral, right lateral,\nright posterolateral, right posterior, mid posterior, left posterior, left posterolateral and left lateral peripheral zone. The tumor focus\nmeasures 3.0 x 2. cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in three cross sections and extensively in the apex\nand base regions. The tumor invades focally the right bladder neck. The tumor invades focally the intraprostatic portion of the right\nseminal vesicle. The margins of resection are free of tumor.\nPlease refer to the previous report for the diagnosis of the pelvic lymph nodes.\nGROSS DESCRIPTION\n(C) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A prostate ,attached right and left seminal vesicles and attached segments of right\nand left vasa deferentia.\nThe prostate gland (3.5 x 2.0 x 4.8 cm, 42 gm, postfixation) has the usual shape. The soft tissue present along the left\nposterolateral aspects of the prostate appears more abundant than along the right side. A nodule is palpated on the right base\nregion. Blue ink is applied to surfaces of the prostate (anterior apex and under flap on left posterior surface) which do not represent\nthe true margin of resection.\nSECTION CODE: C1-C3, right seminal vesicle and segment of right vas deferens from the base towards the tip; C4-C6,\nleft seminal vesicle and segment of left vas deferens from the base towards the tip; C7, C8, prostatic base right border; C9-C11, Page: 4\nAccession:\nSpecimen Date Time:\nprostatic base right posterior border ;C12-C19, prostatic base central portion ;C20-C22, prostatic base left border ;C23-C25,\nprostatic base left posterior border ;C27-C29, apex anterior ;C30, C31, apex left ;C32, C33 , apex posterior ;C34, C35 , apex right;\nC36, C37, detached portions from margin of resection according to specimen radiograph ;C38-C49, sections of the three cross\nsections of the prostate according to specimen radiograph.\nThe anterior aspect of the prostate is inked ink green ,left surface in red, right surface in yellow and posterior surface in\nblack .Blue ink (23-29, 42, 43 and 46) and orange ink (C38, 41, 44-47 and 49) denote surfaces that do not represent the true\nmargin of resection.\n.SNOMED CODES\nEntire report and diagnosis completed by:\n------END OF REPORT------",

Since the \nstatus of the resection margin in unclear in the region of the right apex, further investigations will \nbe conducted. \nAn additional immunohistological investigation will be carried out to establish whether there is \nany invasion of the vessels. The results will be presented in a follow-up report. \nNo evidence of the previously described mantle cell lymphoma could be detected in these \nfindings from the investigation of the lymph nodes. \nFollow-up report \nMicroscopy \n(HE, I tissue block, immunohistochemistry: AEII AE3 and 2 fmiher tissue blocks in each case \nimmunohistochemislly: D240 and CD31. \nIn the meantime, fmiher step sections and a supplementary immunohistochemical investigation \nwere carried out with suspected tumor involvement of the surgical resection margin in the region \nof the right apex. Tumor cells here extend very nearly to the blue-labeled preparation margin. In \nview of the very marked thermal atiifacts in this region, however, it is difficult to make any \nassessment here. Individual cytokeratin-positive cells have questionable contact with the blue\u00ad\nlabeled resection margin, but no unequivocal evidence of tumor contact can be shown with \nabsolute certainty even after additional investigations, so the R status must most likely be \nassumed to be RO. \nThe additional immunohistochemical investigation of two representative tumor blocks confirms \nthe presence of a tumorous invasion of the lymph vessels. No signs of blood vessel invasion \nwere found.  The final tumor classification is thus as follows: \npTIb, maximum tumor diameter 17 mm, tumor involves approx. 30% of the total prostate, \nGleason 4+5=9 (Gleason 5: 20%), L1, YO, pN1 (2110), RO. ",

The tumor is located in the right\nanterior, mid anterior, left anterior , left anterolateral , left lateral, left posterolateral, left posterior, mid\nposterior, right posterior, right posterolateral and right lateral peripheral zone. It is estimated that the tumor\noccupies approximately 70% of the prostatic volume. The tumor focus measures 4.5 x 3.0 cm in the largest\ncross-sectional dimension and it is present in three cross sections and extensively in the apex and base\nregions. The tumor exhibits extraprostatic extension in the left lateral and left posterolateral aspect of the\nprostate, left superior neurovascular bundle region and posterior surface of the prostate at the base level.\nAt the sites of extraprostatic extension, the margin of resection is free of tumor. The tumor extends in the\nright posterolateral aspect of the prostate to less than 0.1 mm from the inked surface. Focal marginal\ninvolvement cannot be excluded.\nThe tumor extensively involves the left seminal vesicle including intra and extraprostatic portions.\nPlease refer to the previous report for the diagnosis of the pelvic lymph nodes.\nGROSS DESCRIP TION Page: 4\nSpecimen Date/Time:\n(D) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A specimen consisting of a prostate, attached right and left\nseminal vesicles and attached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.\nThe prostate gland (5.8 x 3.3 x 3.4 cm, 51 grams, post-fixation) has the usual shape. The soft tissue\npresent along the left posterolateral aspect of the prostate appears more abundant than along the right side.\nNodules are palpated on the left and right sides of the prostate .Serial cross sections after fixation\ndemonstrate areas consistent with tumor in the right posterolateral and left posterolateral peripheral zone of\nthe three cross sections of the prostate.\nThe seminal vesicles and segments of vasa deferentia are grossly free of tumor.\nSECTION CODE :D1-D3, right seminal vesicle and segment of right vas deferens from the base\ntowards the tip; D4-D6, left seminal vesicle and segment of left vas deferens from the base towards the tip;\nD7, D8 ,prostatic base ,right border ;D9-D12, prostatic base, right posterior border ;D13-D22 ,prostatic base,\ncentral portion; D23, D24, prostatic base, left border; D5-D28, prostatic base, left posterior border; D29-D31,\napex anterior; D32, D33, apex left; D34, D35, apex posterior; D36, D37, apex right; D38-D49, sections of\nthe three cross sections of the prostate according to specimen radiograph.\nThe anterior aspect of the prostate is inked in green ,left surface in red, right surface in yellow and\nposterior surface in black.\nSNOMED CODE S\nT-92000, M-Y1973\nEntire report and diagnosis completed by:\n------END OF REPORT------\nCriteria\nDiagnosis Discrepancy\nPrimary Tumor Site Discrepancy\n111PAA Disuepancy\nPrior Malignancy History\nNoted Dual/Synchronous Primary\ncase is tunic):\nReviewer Init!Yes -",

Per the operative\nnote, there is no lymph node tissue, or fatty tissue In the obturator fossa or overlying external iliac\nveins, so a lymph node dissection Is not performed.\nGross Description\nThe specimen is received in two parts, each labeled with the patient's name and medical record number.\nPart A, received fresh and labeled \"prostate and seminal vesicles,\" consists of a 29 gm radical\nprostatectomy specimen measuring 3.1 cm from superior to inferior, 4.5 cm from medial to lateral, and\n2.4 cm from anterior to posterior, containing an unremarkable left seminal vesicle (3.0 x 1.1 x 0.5 cm),\nright seminal vesicle (3.0 x 1.7 x 0.9 cm), left vas deferens (2.5 x 0.6 cm), and right vas deferens (2.3\nx 0.6 cm). A portion of the tumor is taken for tissue banking purposes from the left and right posterior\nmid gland. The specimen Is then glued together and is fixed overnight. After fixation, the apex and\nbase urethral margins are removed, and the specimen is transversely sectioned from apex to base into\neight slices.There are suspicious tan-white nodules in the left posterior mid gland (slice 4) and the left\nand right posterior mid glands (slice 6). The nodules do not appear to Involve the seminal vesicles, and\ndo not involve any of the specimen margins. The surface of the prostate gland is somewhat roughened\nand contains numerous metal surgical clips. The left prostate Is Inked blue, the right green,, and the\ndeep, black. Representative sections are submitted as follows:\nApical margins\nCassette Al: Right apex, 12 - 6 o'clock, radially sectioned and entirely submitted.\nCassette A2: Left apex, 12 - 6 o'clock, radially sectioned and entirely submitted.\nRight anterior quadrant\nCassette A3: Serial slice 2.\nCassette A4: Serial slice 4.\nCassette AS: Serial slice 6.\nRight posterior quadrant\nCassette A6: Serial slice 2.\nCassette A7: Serial slice 4.\nCassette A8: Serial slice 6.\nCassette A9: Serial slice 8.\nLeft posterior quadrant\nCassette A10: Serial slice 2.\nCassette All: Serial slice 4.\nCassette A12: Serial slice 6.

This tumor focusmeasures 2.0 x 1 .0 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in the single cross section of the prostate and\nextensively in the apex and base. In the right superior neurovascular bundle region, this tumor focus extends focally into\nextraprostatic tissue. The added length of extraprostatic extension is 2.0 mm. The margins of resection are free of tumor. The\nsecond tumor focus is located in the left lateral and left posterolateral peripheral zone. This tumor focus measures 1.0 x 0.4 cm in\nthe largest cross -sectional dimension and it is present in the single cross section of the prostate and focally in the apex and base.\nThis tumor focus is of lower histologic grade and confined to the prostate with negative margins.\nGROSS DESCRIPTION\n(E) LEFT BASE - A fragment of tan-gray tissue measuring 1.5 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm .No orientation provided .Submitted in E.(F)PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES- A specimen consisting of a prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles andattached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.\nThe prostate gland (4.6 x 2.2 x 2.7 cm, 21 grams ,post fixation) has the usual shape. The soft tissue present along the\nposterolateral aspects of the prostate is scant and symmetrical .A firm nodule is present on the right base of the prostate.

This tumor focus measures 2.5 x 1.6 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in\nthe two cross sections of the prostate, extensively in the apex and focally in the base region. This tumor exhibits extensive\nmultifocal extraprostatic extension. Extraprostatic extension is present in the right anterolateral and right lateral surface of the\nprostate and in the right superior neurovascular bundle region. Extraprostatic extension is present in multiple sections and the\nadded length of extraprostatic extension is 5.0 mm. The margins of resection are free of tumor. The second tumor focus is\nlocated in the right and left transition zone. This tumor focus measures 1.6 x 0.5 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and it\nis present in the two cross sections of the prostate and focally in the apex and base regions.

The dominant tumor focus is located in multiple regions of the right side of the prostate and exhibits extensive multifocal extraprostatic extension. The second tumor focus is located in the right and left transition zone and is of lower histologic grade but confined to the prostate. All margins of resection are free of tumor, and there is no evidence of lymphovascular invasion or metastasis to the seminal vesicles or vas deferens. The Gleason score for the dominant tumor focus is 7 (4+3), indicating a moderately differentiated cancer with a worse prognosis than lower-grade cancers. Overall, the report suggests that the patient has malignant prostatic adenocarcinoma with extraprostatic extension and a Gleason score of 7, affecting both sides of the prostate gland."

Both tumor foci are located in the peripheral zone. The\ndominant tumor focus is located in the right anterolateral, right lateral, right posterolateral and right posterior peripheral zone. This\ntumor focus measures 2.0 x 1.0 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in two cross sections and extensively\nin the apex and base region. In the right superior neurovascular bundle region, this tumor focus extends into extraprostatic tissue.\nThe extent of margin of extraprostatic extension is 4.0 mm. The margin of resection is free of tumor.\nThe second tumor focus is located in the left posterolateral peripheral zone, exclusively in the apical region. This tumor focus\nmeasures 1.0 x 0.2 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in a single apical section. This tumor is confined\nto the prostate. All margins of resection are free of tumor.\nGROSS DESCRIPTION\n(A)PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A specimen consisting of a prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles and\nattached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.The prostate gland (4.7 x 2.7 x 3.0 cm, 28 grams, post fixation) has the usual shape. The soft tissue present along the left\nposterolateral aspect of the prostate appears slightly more abundant than along the right side. An area of firmness is noted on the\nright side of the prostate. Serial cross sections after fixation demonstrate an area consistent with tumor in the right side of the two\ncross sections of the prostate.\nThe seminal vesicles and segments of vasa deferentia are grossly free of tumor.\nAlso included in the container are three fragments of tubular structures consistent with vas deferens measuring 2.6 x 0.4 x\n0.2 cm, 3.7 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm, 1.2 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm and a fragment of adipose tissue measuring 1.2 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm.\nSECTION CODE: Al -A4, detached fragments of tissue; A5-A7, right seminal vesicle and segment of right vas deferens\nfrom the base towards the tip; A8-A1 0, left seminal vesicle and segment of left vas deferens from the base towards the tip; Al 1, Page: 3\nSpecimen Date Time:\nprostatic base, right border; A12, A13, prostatic base, right posterior border; A14-A18, prostatic base, central portion; A19,\nprostatic base, left border; A20, A21, prostatic base, left posterior border; A22, A23, apex anterior; A24, A25, apex left; A26, A27,\napex posterior; A28, A29, apex right; A30-A37, sections of the two cross sections of the prostate according to specimenradiograph.\nThe anterior aspect of the prostate is inked in green, left surface in red, right surface in yellow and posterior surface inblack.Blue ink (A29) and orange ink (A34 and A35) denote surfaces that do not represent the true margin of resection.\nSNOMED CODES\nEntire report and diagnosis completed by:\n------END OF REPORT------",

Two tumor-free lipomatous lymph nodes. No malignancy. \nRemark \nExtensive carcinoma infiltrates are found in the peripheral zone of both sides in all sections of \nthe prostate. An infiltration of the perisprostatic fatty connective tissue is found along major \nnerves in the right lateral region close to the apex and on the right close to the base. No \nidentifiable invasion of the vessels. The left medial patt of the apex shows foci of contact \nbetween the carcinoma and the blue labeling (diameter about 2 cm).

The left is inked black and the right blue.The apical margin is shaved and then sectioned perpendicularly. The basemargin is similarly sectioned. The bases of the seminal vesicles aresampled. On sectioning, there is mild central nodular hyperplasia. Theperipheral lobes are tan and spongy with a 2.1 x 2.0 cm indurated paleyellow focus within the left lobe near the mid-point.

During the operative procedure there was a surgical violation of the \nprostatic capsule in two places that were marked by surgical sutures for gross examination. One of \nthese areas was at the site of the positive margin and comparing this information to the histological \nsection it is likely that inked drained through this surgically created cleft. In summary, it is likely that the \ntumor at the inked surface in this slide is not a true margin. ",

On palpation, multiple firm fatty possible lymph \nnodes are identified ranging from 0.1 up to 2.0 cm in \ngreatest dimension. They are entirely submitted in cassettes \nA 1-4, labeled designated as follows: A 1, \nfive whole possible Iympn nodes; A2, four whole possible \nlymph nodes; A:3 and 4, one whole possible bisected lymph \nnode in each cassette. \nB. The specimen is received in a single formalin-filled \ncontainer labeled with the patients name \n\"prostate,\" and contains a 34.9 gm, 4.8 x 3.5 x 3.0 cm \nprostate received with attached bilateral adnexa having \noverall dimensions of 6.5 x 3.5 x 0.5 cm. The capsule is' \ntan-gray and shaggy. The specimen is inked as follows: right \nside blue, left side black. The base and apical margins are \nconed and serially sectioned. The remainder of the gland is \nserially sectioned from apex to base to reveal a 1.5 x 1.0 x \n0.8 cm, well-circumscribed, yellow-tan nodule located in the \nright posterior quadrant. This nodule abuts the inked \ncapsule. Additionally, a 2.5 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm, ill-defined \narea of tan-orange discoloration is present within the right \nand left posterior quadrants. This area approaches to within \n0.5 cm of the base margin and to within 0.2 cm of the right \nprostate/seminal vesicle junction. The remainder of the cut \nsurface is pink-tan and focally cystic with diffuse \nperiurethral nodularity. No additional lesions or calculi \nare identified. Representative sections are submitted in \ncassettes B 1-18, labeled designated as \nfollows: 1, right prostate/seminal vesicle junction; 2, left \nprostate /seminal vesicle junction; 3 and 4, apical margin, \nperpendicular; 5 and 6, base margin, perpendicular; 7-9, \nright anterior, apex to base; 10-12, right posterior, apex \nto base; 13-15, left anterior, apex to base; 16-18, left \nposterior, apex to base.

The tumor measures 3.5 x 2.5 cm in the largest\ncross-sectional dimension and it is present in the two cross sections of the prostate and extensively in the apex and base. The\ntumor involves the right anterolateral, right lateral, right posterolateral, right posterior, mid posterior, left posterior and left lateral\nperipheral zone with extension into the right and left transition zone. The tumor exhibits extraprostatic extension in multiple areas\nand extends to the margin of resection on the anterior and right apical region. The added length of marginal involvement is 6.0\nmm. The tumor invades the right seminal vesicle.\nPlease refer to the previous report for the diagnosis of the pelvic lymph nodes.\nGROSS DESCRIPTION\n(C) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A specimen consisting of a prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles and\nattached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.\nThe prostate gland (4.9 x 4.0 x 4.5 cm, 30.0 grams, post-fixation) has the usual shape. The soft tissue present along the\nright posterolateral aspect of the prostate is abundant and more extensive than along the left side. Nodules are palpated on the\nright and left sides of the prostate. Serial cross-sections after fixation demonstrate areas consistent with tumor, involving the right\nand left sides of the two cross sections of the prostate.\nThe seminal vesicles and segments of vasa deferentia are grossly free of tumor.\nSECTION CODE: C1-C4, right seminal vesicle and segment of right vas deferens from the base towards the tip; C5-C8,\nleft seminal vesicle and segment of left vas deferens from the base towards the tip; C9, C 10, prostatic base, right border;\nC11-C13, prostatic base, right posterior border; C14-C22, prostatic base, central portion; C23, prostatic base, left border; C24,\nC25, prostatic base, left posterior border; C26, C27, apex anterior; C28, C29, apex left; C30-C33, apex posterior; C34, C35, apex\nright; C36, detached portions of margin of resection according to the specimen radiograph; C37-C44, sections of the two\ncross-sections of the prostate according to the specimen radiograph.\nThe anterior aspect of the prostate is inked in green, left surface in red, right surface in yellow and posterior surface in Page: 4\nSpecimen Date/Time:\nblack .Blue ink (C39 and C43 )and orange ink (C37 and C40) denote surfaces that do not represent the true margin of resection.\nSNOMED CODES\nn ire repo an iagnosis completed by:\n------END OF REPORT------\n%\n#4 P\"ut^\nanclDi^a^no:is Uis^: ep_\nPrimary i_urnorSite [`,screPa ncY^^1\ntIIP^ Discrepair.,Ti'LidcYH!storVIionnM ^ ^ Prig\nr D.a/SYnch venous P_nrnar\n';NUArI/DI54U^LIfIE^ ,^`\nCase is ^ciiclc?:Uate Reviewed'\naeviewcr Initials __-----^",
        "llm_output": " Site: Prostate and seminal vesicles\nLaterality: Right seminal vesicle involved\nHistology: Prostatic adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 9 (4 + 5)\nStage: Not provided in the report, but extensive extraprostatic extension, invasion into the right seminal vesicle, and involvement of the margin of resection are mentioned.\nGrade: Gleason score 9 (4 + 5)\nBehavior: Malignant\n\nJustification for the choice: The report specifically mentions the diagnosis of prostatic adenocarcinoma with a Gleason score of 9, indicating a high-grade tumor. There is also extensive extraprostatic extension and involvement of the right seminal vesicle, suggesting that the cancer has spread beyond the prostate gland. The involvement of the margin of resection indicates that some cancer cells are present at the edge of the surgical specimen, increasing the risk of recurrence. Therefore, based on the information provided in the report, I have categorized this as a high-grade and locally advanced prostate cancer with a poor prognosis."

Histology: Adenocarcinoma, which is the most common type of prostate cancer.\n4. Stage: The report mentions that the tumor has a stage T2c, which means it is still confined to the prostate gland but has invaded both lobes.\n5. Grade: The grade is not explicitly mentioned in the report, but it can be inferred from the Gleason score of 7 (3+4), which indicates a moderately differentiated tumor.\n6. Behavior: Malignant, as it is an adenocarcinoma with a Gleason score of 7.\n\nJustification: The site is inferred from the context, laterality is not provided, histology is mentioned as adenocarcinoma, stage is explicitly stated as T2c, grade is inferred from the Gleason score, and behavior is malignant based on the Gleason score and the fact that it is an adenocarcinoma."

The right anterior surface of the prostate is \ninked blue, the left anterior surface is inked green, and the posterior surface is inked black. The prostatic \napex, bladder neck, and seminal vesicles/vasa are trimmed. The prostate is divided into right and left \nhalves and is sectioned from apex to bladder neck. In the apical third of the right prostate, there is a 0.7 \ncm circumscribed area of firm yellowish discoloration suggestive of neoplasm. There is very patchy, small, \nyellowish discoloration of the corresponding portion of the left apical prostate. The prostatic gland \nparenchyma is otherwise tan and shows bulging yellow nodularity in the periurethral region bilaterally. \nAlso in the specimen container are three cylindrical fragments of pale tan tissue suggestive of portions of \nvasa varying from 1.1-1.8 cm in length and up to 0.4 cm in diameter.

The specimen is submitted as follows:\nCassette Al: Four candidate lymph nodes.\nCassette A2: One candidate lymph node.\nCassettes A3-A5: Remaining fatty tissue.\nPart B, labeled \"left pelvic lymph node,\" consists of multiple soft to firm, irregular, pink-tan/yellow fatty\ntissue fragments measuring 2.7 x 1.7 x 0.4 cm in aggregate. Three candidate lymph nodes are found\nranging between 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.2 through 1.7 x 0.8 x 0.3 cm. The specimen is submitted as follows:\nCassette 81: Three candidate lymph nodes.\nCassette B2: Remaining fatty tissue.\nPart C, received fresh and additionally labeled \"prostate and SV,\" consists of a 49-gram prostate gland\nwith intact seminal vesicles/vas deferens bundles. The gland measures 4.0 cm medial-lateral, 3.5 cm\napex-base, and 4.0 cm anterior-posterior. The external surface of the gland is soft, red-tan and is\nreceived with a single suture and a single metal clip. The seminal vesides/vas deferens bundles are soft\nand red-tan. The left measures 4.5 x 2.5 x 1.0 cm and the right measures 3.5 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm. The\nright vas deferens measures 3.0 x 0.5 cm and the left measures 2.0 x 0.5 cm. A palpable lesion is\nnoted along the right posterior mid. The right anterior surface of the gland is inked green, the left\nanterior surface is inked blue, and the posterior surface is inked black. The apical and bladder margins\nare removed, and the remainder of the gland is serially sectioned from apex to base into five serial slices of 5 mm average thickness .The seminal vesicles /vas deferens bundles are attached to serial slice\n5.Serial slices reveal a vague ,yellow area in the right posterior of slices 1, 2, 3 and 4, and another\nvague ,yellow, irregular area in the left posterior of serial slices 2 and 3. Following further dissection\nand submission of tissue for pathologic evaluation ,tissue is taken from slices 1 ,2, 3 and 4 for research\npurposes .The entire gland is submitted as follows:\nApical margins\nCassettes Cl: Left.\nCassettes C2: Right.\nSerial slice 1\nCassette C3: Left..\nCassette C4: Right.\nRight anterior quadrant\nCassette CS: Serial slice 2.\nCassette C6: Serial slice 3.\nCassette C7: Serial slice 4.\nRight posterior quadrant\nCassette C8: Serial slice 2.\nCassette C9: Serial slice 3.\nCassette C10: Serial slice 4.\nLeft posterior quadrant\nCassette C11: Serial slice 2.\nCassette C12: Serial slice 3.\nCassette C13: Serial slice 4.\nLeft anterior quadrant\nCassette C14: Serial slice 2.\nCassette C15: Serial slice 3.\nCassette C16 : Serial slice 4.\nSeminal vesicle bundles\nCassette C17: Left.\nCassette C18: Right.\nBladder margin\nCassette C19: Left.\nCassette C20:\nRight.\nDiagnosis based on gross and microscopic examinations.
