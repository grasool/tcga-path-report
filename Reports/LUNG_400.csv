sectioned and individually submitted labeled A-8. Remaining tissue 
fragments are submitted labeled C. 
Container labeled -left upper lobe"" has a 
. -. e_ .. l' - previously partially ctioned portion of 
recognizable pulmonary parenchyma grossly consistent with left upper 
lobe of lung. The specimen as received weighs 126 grams and measures 
16.7 x 9.5 x 2.9 cm. The margin of resection is bifurcation of the 
tertiary bronchi with an adjacent 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.7 cm fleshy 
gray-black nodule. The pleura is slightly wrinkled gray-pink and 
moderately anthracotic streaked. On the posterior aspect of the mid 
region is a partially sectioned previously inked 3.5 x 3.2 cm area 
of umbilicated induration . The specimen is partially sectioned in 
of 3 
 this region to reveal an underlying 3.5 x 2.9 x up to 1.6 cm 
somewhat fleshy focally gritty gray-tan fibrotic lesion which 
extends to but does not grossly appear to extend through the pleura. 
This is seen at its nearest point 2.3 cm from the nearest bronchial 
margin. An apparent bronchial connection is identified . On 
sectioning , the remaining parenchyma reveals spongy congested 
parenchyma with minimal anthracotiC streaking . No additional gross 
lesions are identified . Also received in the same container are two 
tissue cassettes . The first is a red cassette labeled "" and 
the second is a gray cassette labeled ""good"". Representative 
sections of the tissue are submitted labeled as follows: A -shaved

Comments 
Sections of the tumor show a well differentiated mucinous 
adenocarcinoma . Focally, in one residual bronchus , an area of in 
situ adenocarcinoma is identified. In addition , some subpleural 
fibrosis is present suggesting that this is a primary adenocarcinoma 
as opposed to a metastatic adenocarcinoma. A panel of 
immunohistochemical stains is performed including CK7, CK20, CDX2, 
and TTF1 (with appropriate positive and negative controls). The 
neoplastic cells are strongly positive for CK7. The neoplastic 
cells demonstrate some scattered focal positive stain for CK20. The 
neoplastic cells demonstrate focal weakly positive staining TTF1. 
In addition, the neoplastic cells demonstrate a rare focal positive 
staining cell for CDX2. 
This demonstrates a well differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma. 
The subpleural fibrosis would suggest this represents a primary lung 
neoplasm, however, the immunohistochemical stains are equivocal and 
therefore the possibility of a metastatic lesion cannot be fully 
excluded on histologic grounds alone. Clinical correlation and 
follow up is recommended.

MICROSCOPIC 
A) Sections through the wedge resection from the left upper lobe confirm 
the presence of non-small cell carcinoma. The tumor is predominantly 
composed of solid nests of cells with large vesicular nuclei and abundant 
eosinophilic cytoplasm. Mitotic activity is fairly abundant and areas of 
tumor necrosis are seen. The tumor is predominantly growing in solid nests 
with minimal acinar formation. although occasional foci of both 
intracellular and extracellular mucin are suggested. This lesion abuts but 
does not appear to specifically infiltrate within the overlying visceral 
pleura Assessment in this regard includes an elastic stain on block A6. 
Noninvolved pulmonary parenchyma demonstrates nonspecific emphysematous 
changes but is otherwise unremarkable. A limited immunohistochemical 
evaluation of this lesion is performed with results as follows:  TTF -1: Positive 
_in A: Negative 
Negative 
P63: Limited/focal positivity is seen 
The combination of TTF-1 positivity with apparent focal mucin production by 
this neoplasm would confirm a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. 
B-G) The microscopic appearance substantiates the diagnosis.

Breast,,Invasive carcinoma of no special type (NST) without specific differentiation,T2 N0 Mx,II or III,Malignant,ER-ADRU.pdf,                       ," Report: 
The sample consists of a fragment of neoplastic tissue measuring 3.5 x 2.2 x 1.8 cm. The tumor is composed of nests and cords of relatively uniform cells with moderate amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm and round to oval nuclei containing fine chromatin and inconspicuous nucleoli. The mitotic activity is brisk, approximately 12 mitoses per 10 high power fields. There is focal necrosis present. The tumor shows infiltration into the surrounding fibroadipose tissue. No lymphovascular invasion is identified. Immunohistochemical stains show that the tumor cells are positive for estrogen and progesterone receptors, and negative for HER2/neu. The surgical margins are widely negative.

1. Site: Breast - The report mentions ""a fragment of neoplastic tissue"" but does not provide explicit information about the site; however, the context implies that it is a breast tumor due to the description and immunohistochemical stains for estrogen and progesterone receptors, which are typically performed for breast cancer.

2. Laterality: Not provided - The report does not mention whether the tumor is from the left or right breast.

3. Histology: Invasive carcinoma of no special type (NST), also known as invasive ductal carcinoma, without specific differentiation - This diagnosis is based on the description of nests and cords of relatively uniform cells infiltrating the surrounding tissue, along with the absence of features indicative of a specific subtype.

4. Stage: T2 - Based on the size of the tumor (3.5 cm) and the invasion into the surrounding fibroadipose tissue, it can be classified as T2 according to the TNM staging system for breast cancer. N0, Mx - No information is provided about lymph node involvement or distant metastasis in this report; thus, they are classified as N0 (no regional lymph node metastasis) and Mx (metastasis cannot be assessed).

5. Grade: Grade II or III - The report mentions brisk mitotic activity (12 mitoses per 10 high power fields), focal necrosis, and moderate nuclear atypia; however, it does not provide enough information to definitively classify the tumor as either grade II or III.

6. Behavior: Malignant - This is inherent in the diagnosis of invasive carcinoma, which indicates malignant behavior by definition.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Colon,,Adenocarcinoma,T2N0Mx,II,Malignant,CDDP-ABJZ.pdf,," Report: 
The surgical specimen shows a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma involving the mucosa and submucosa with no evidence of lymphovascular invasion. No regional lymph nodes were removed for examination.

1. ""Site"": Colon. Justification: The report mentions the surgical specimen, and colon adenocarcinoma is the most common type of cancer in this location.
2. ""Laterality"": Not provided. Justification: The report does not mention any laterality information as it refers to the colon without specifying left or right side.
3. ""Histology"": Adenocarcinoma. Justification: The report directly states a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma in the surgical specimen.

The examination of this case material and the preparation of this report were  
performed by the staff pathologist.  
 Note:  
Frozen section diagnoses are confirmed.   Mucicarmine, TTF -1, Napsin A, CK 5/6,  
and p63 were performed on block D4 in conjunction with appropriately reacting  
controls to assess for  glandular and squamous differentiation.   Mucicarmine does  
not show any intracytoplasmic positivity.   The immunohistochemical staining  
results show the tumor cells are diffusely and strongly positive for CK5/6 and  
p63, while negative for TTF -1 and Napsin A . These staining results in  
conjunction with the light microscopic features are consistent with a diagnosis  
of squamous cell carcinoma.

MACROSCOPIC
One specimen received.
The specimen is labelled `L wedge resection lingula' and consists of a wedge
resection of lung measuring in its partially Inflated state 115 x 90 x 35 mm.
A staple line is present at the proximal margin measuring 85 mm in length. The
pleural surface contains two separate ragged/indurated areas .The largest
measures 35 x 25 mm and Is roughened. The second smaller area measures 17 mm
in greatest dimension and has a punched out full thickness defect in the
pleura. The pleura surrounding these roughened areas shows diffuse thickening.
The cut surface shows a pleural-based. peripheral tumour. It has an ill-defined
outline with prominent adjacent collapse and consolidation. The tumour
measures approximately 35 x 31 x 19 mm. It appears to directly Involve the two
disrupted pleural surfaces described previously. The tumour lies. 15 mm from
the nearest surgical resection margin. The cut surface of the rest of the lung
parenchyma shows extensive obstructive changes. There are small firm nodules
within this ranging In size from 1 to 5 mm In. greatest dimension. They may
represent separate tumour foci. There Is also mild emphysema. [1A-1B, tumour
including resection margin ;1C-ID, RS tumour adjacent to smaller full thickness
pleural defect; 1E, RS tumour adjacent to intact pleura next to small defect;
1F, RS tumour adjacent to larger full thickness pleural defect; 1G, RS possible
separate tumour foci within consolidation; 1H, RS relatively normal lung.]
MICROSCOPIC
Sections show a moderately differentiated keratinising squamous cell carcinoma.
it shows areas of necrosis and is associated with a florid Inflammatory
response. Invasion of the visceral pleura is confirmed and carcinoma is
present on the inked surface of the disrupted pleura. The stapled. surgical
resection margin is well clear of malignancy. Tumour surrounds and compresses
a number of blood vessels, and there is focal vascular invasion. No lymphatic
or perineural invasion is identified. The surrounding lung is confirmed to
show organising obstructive pneumonitis. The nodules noted macroscopically
appear to represent foci of bronchiectasis, organising pneumonia and localised
subpleural honeycomb change. No tumour is identified within these areas.
There is interstitial fibrosis in these areas and there are a few foci of
fibroblastic proliferation reminiscent of the fibroblastic foci of UIP; however
the section of normal appearing lung shows only emphysema with no features to
suggest an established interstitial pneumonitis. No lymph nodes are included.
SUMMARY
Lingulectomy:
Moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, 35 mm in diameter.
Pleural Invasion present with disruption and tumour on pleural surface. Vascular invasion present.
No lymphatic or perineural invasion identified.
No lymph nodes included.

HISTORY
Lobectomy for carcinoma.
MACROSCOPIC
Six specimens are received.17113
1: The first specimen Is labelled ""R middle lobe, R lower lobe, R upper lobe""
and consists of right middle and lower lobes with a small stapled wedge of
upper lobe superiorly. The specimen measures 165 x 75 x 45 mm with the stapled
wedge of upper lobe measuring 70 x 30 x 30 mm. There is a firm mass with
overlying pleural adhesions at the apical aspect of the lower lobe, measuring
52 x 50 x 35 mm. On sectioning, the mass has a pale sclerotic appearance and
is centrally cavitated. The cavity measures 12 mm across. The tumour extends
to apparently Involve the lateral pleural surface and It extends close to the
pleura on the medial aspect. In this region it extends into a bronchus. There
is possible involvement of the upper lobe but the tumour appears well clear of
the stapled upper lobe resection margin. No other focal lesions are identified
on sectioning and there are no other endobronchial lesions. [Bronchial and
vascular resection margin, 1A; peribronchial lymph nodes, 1B; tumour with
overlying pleura, 1C-1E; tumour and upper lobe resection margin, IF; tumour and
medial surface of lung, 1G; further section, 11-1; tumour and proximal bronchus,
1I; random section of lung, 13.]
2: The second specimen Is labelled ""upper lobe lymph node ""and consists of two
pieces of lymph node ,17 x 15 x 7 mm and 15 x 11 x 8 mm .[Each piece bisected
and blocked in toto, 2A]
3: The third specimen is labelled ""No. 11 lymph node"" and consists of three
pieces of tissue measuring 18 x 15 x 8 mm in aggregate. [Largest: piece
bisected and all tissue wrapped and blocked in toto, 3A]
4: The Fourth specimen is labelled ""No. 7 lymph node"" and consists o fpieces of
fatty tissue measuring 45 x 30 x 15 mm in aggregate .[BIT, 4A-46]
5: The fifth specimen Is labelled ""No. 8 lymph node"" and consists of a piece of
lymph node measuring 18 x 10 x 6 mm. [Bisected and BIT]
6: The sixth specimen is labelled No. 9 lymph node ""and consists of lymph node
with surrounding fat measuring 35 x 16 x 8 mm. [Bisected and BIT]
MICROSCOPIC
1: Sections show a poorly differentiated squarnous cell carcinoma with central
cavitation. The cavitation appears to be due, at least in part, to vascular
invasion by tumour which is present at multiple sites throughout the sections.
Tumour Invades into overlying parietal pleura but appears clear of the soft(7//A16,cs, S7O/3

tissue resection margin. No lymphatic invasion is seen, and peribronchial
lymph nodes show no evidence of metastatic carcinoma. The upper lobe resection
margin is well clear of malignancy. Proximally the tumour has a protruding
endobronchiat component but no in situ squamous carcinoma is found, and the
bronchial resection margin is clear of malignancy. Focal perineural invasion
is found towards the hilum. Lung parenchyma adjacent to the tumour shows
organising pneumonia, while more distant lung parenchyma is unremarkable.
2:Sections show reactive lymphoid hyperplasia and several silicotic nodules,
but there is no evidence of metastatic carcinoma.
3:Sections show small foci of metastatic squamous cell, carcinoma in one of
the lymph nodes.
4-6: Sections show reactive lymphoid hyperplasia and scattered silicotic
nodules, but there is no evidence of metastatic carcinoma.
SUMMARY
Right middle and lower lobectomy, partial resection of right upper lobe and
lymph node sampling:
Poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of apical segment of right lower
lobe, 52 mm in diameter.
Invasion of parietal pleura present, but soft tissue resection margin clear of
malignancy.
Extensive vascular invasion present.
Focal perineural invasion present.
No lymphatic invasion . found.
Metastatic carcinoma in no. 11 lymph node.
Pathological stage T3 N1.

left breast,left,Invasive ductal carcinoma,,Grade III (High grade or poorly differentiated),Malignant,TCGA-56-8628.pdf,    ," Report: 
The patient is a 64-year-old woman with a history of left breast mass. A core needle biopsy was performed. The specimen consists of two fragments of tan-pink tissue. The larger fragment measures 0.9 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm and the smaller fragment measures 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm. Microscopic description: The tumor is composed of cells arranged in cords and nests, with focal comedo necrosis. The tumor cells have high nucleus to cytoplasm ratio, vesicular chromatin, and conspicuous nucleoli. Mitotic figures are easily identified. Immunohistochemical stains show the tumor cells to be positive for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2 neu. The background shows extensive lymphocytic infiltration. No ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or invasive carcinoma is identified in the surrounding breast tissue.

1. ""Site"": left breast. Justification: The report mentions a left breast mass and the biopsy was performed on the left breast.
2. ""Laterality"": left. Justification: The tumor is located in the left breast, as stated in the report.
3. ""Histology"": Invasive ductal carcinoma. Justification: The report mentions the tumor cells are arranged in cords and nests with focal comedo necrosis, consistent with invasive ductal carcinoma.

MACROSCOPIC 
Five specimens received: 
I: The frrst specimen is labelled ""left upper lobe"" and consists of a lobe of lung measurin g 155 x 95 x 
58 mm in the fresh state. Below the hilum there is a finn tumour which measures 68 x 65 mm in 
maximal dimension and has a finn sclerotic cut surface. Towards the superior aspect of this there is a 
finn node which is adherent to the medial aspect of the tumour. Further enlarged nodes are present 
surrounding the inferior aspect of the bronchial resection margin and pulmonary artery. The tumour 
abuts the pleural surface on this medial aspect but appears clear of the lateral aspect by approximately 
10 mm. On sectioning there are areas of necrosis and the tumour has a sclerotic cut face. Elsewhere 
there is apical scarring. Distal to the tumour there is evidence of obstructive pneumonitis and in the 
basal aspect of the lung there is a finn grey nodule. The lymph node superior to me tumour measures 
15 mm in diameter while the lymph node inferior to the tumour measures 23 mm in diameter.

2: The second specimen is labelled ""pulmonary artery margin"" and consists ofa segment of vessel 
measuring 7 x 6 x 4 mm. LBIT] 
3: The third specimen is labelled ""L lower lobe node"" and consists of fragments of blackened lymph 
node measuring 16 x 13 x 4 mm in aggregate. [Largest piece bisected and al1 wrapped and blocked in 
toto.] 
4: The fourth specimen is labelJed ''No.5'' and consists of several pieces of lymph node invested in fat 
and measuring 20 x 15 x 14 mm. [Bisected and blocked in toto, 4A] 
5: The fifth specimen is labelled ""lingula L lung"" and consists of[Wo pieces of blackened lymph node, 
and 17 mm in maximal dimension. [Blocked in toto, SA] 
MICROSCOPIC 
I: Sections show a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Patchy necrosis is present. 
Vascular invasion is presenl but the pulmonary artery is clear of malignancy. No pleural, lymphatic or 
perineura l invasion is identified. The bronchial resection margin is clear of malignancy and shows no 
evidence of squamous metaplasia or dysplasia. Obstructive pneumonitis is confinned adjacent to the 
tumour. A way from the tumour there are at least three further distinct lesions. The first is the nodule 
noted in the lower zone which comprises granulomatous inflammation including numerous giant cells 
of Langhans type with surround ing lymphocytic infiltration and fibrosis. A few tiny foci of necrosis 
are present within this nodule. There are [wo further foci of granulomatous inflammation with 
extensive central necrotic debris surrounded by foamy macrophag es and fibrosis. These appear to be 
centred on bronchi. No organisms are identified in any of these lesions with Grocott or ZN stains. 
However the appearances are highly suspicious for infection, and I note that atypical Mycobacteria 
have been found previously in sputum. The peribronchial lymph nodes are confmned to contain 
metastatic squamous cell carcinoma, and they also have foci of fibrosis and dystrophic calcification, 
but they show no evidence of granulomatous inflamma tion. 
2: Sections of the pulmonary artery show no evidence of malignancy . 
3: Sections of the lymph node show multiple silicotic nodules together with extensive sheets of 
pigmented macrophages but there is no evidence of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma. 
4: Sections show lymph nodes with a follicular hyperplasia, sinus histiocytosis and aggregates of 
pigmented macrophages. There is no evidence of malignancy.  5: Sections show fragments oflymph node and surrounding fat. There is no evidence of metastatic 
squamous cell carcinoma. 
SUMMARY 
Left upper lobectomy and lymph node sampling: 
1: Moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, 68 mm in diameter. 
Vascular invasion present. 
No pleural, lymphatic or perineural infiltration seen. 
Bronchial and pulmonary artery resection margins clear of malignan cy.

FINAL PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS: 
Lung, right upper lobe, biopsies: 
Adenocarcinoma -see comment. 
COMMENTS: 
Histologic sections show an invasive carcinoma consisting 
primarily of sheets of cells with scattered, discrete 
glandular structures. The neoplastic cells have prominent 
nucleoli, and do not have the cytologic appearance of small 
cell carcinoma, grade II neuroendocrine carcinoma (atypical 
carcinoid) or large cell neuroendocrine carCinoma. 
Immunohistochemical stains are performed. The neoplasm 
stains positively for cytokeratin CK7 as well as forTTF-1. 
The neoplasm is negative for CK20, high molecular weight 
keratin SK and p63. The findings support the diagnosis of .-
_gdenocarcinoma of lung primary. There is weak staining for 
synaptophysin. It 1s felt 1n that this is an example of 
non-neuroendocrine carcinoma {adenocarcinoma) that shows 
positive staining for synaptophysin, and that it should not 
result in classification of a neuroendocrine tumor. 
Current NCCN practice guidelines recommend determination of 
EGFR and KRAS mutation status in adenocarcinoma of lung to 
help select patients for Tyrosine-Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) 
therapy. EGFR-activating mutations have been shown to be 
significantly associated with response to TKis and KRAS 
mutations are associated with TKI resistance. They are 
mutually exclusive in NSCLC. Additionally, recent data show 
that ALK (Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase) gene rearrangements in 
adenocarcinoma of lung are associated with resistance to 
TKis and have favorable response rates to Crizotinib, the 
ALK inhibitor agent currently in clinical trials. Mutation 
analysis for KRAS and EGFR-TK domain and ALK gene 
rearrangement by FISH is available as the Lung Cancer 
Mutation Panel. Testing may be performed on 
paraffin-embedded tissue from the primary or metastatic 
tumor or pleural fluid cell block. These tests are 
available on request as a panel or as individual assavs. 
This case has been reviewed by 
who agree with the diagnosis.

GROSS DESCRIPTION 
A. Received fresh in a container labeled ""right upper 
lobe"" is a 296 gm, 17.8 x 11.8 x 4 em, lung lobe compatible 
with right upper lobe. In the hilar region there is an 0.8 em long 
and 1.5 em in diameter bronchial stump which is grossly 
unremarkable. The vessels at the margin are also grossly 
unremarkable. There are some tan-gray lymph nodes up to 1.2 em in 
greatest dimension in the hilar region. The pleural surface is 
pink-purple with some anthracotic pigment deposition. There .is some 
retraction of the pleural surface. The specimen is sectioned, and 
there is a 2.6 x 2 x 1.8 em rubbery tan-white mass underlying the 
area with pleural retraction1 with the mass suggestive of invading 
the pleura. Approximately 2 em from this mass is a separate 4 x 3.5 
x 3.1 ern rubbery tan-white mass. This mass approaches at least near 
to the pleural surface. The larger lesion has yellow-orange 
discoloration surrounding it, suggestive of surrounding pneumonia. 
The remainder of the parenchyma is spongy and red-purple without 
addi tiona! lesions. RS-13, follmving fixation.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION 
The follm'ling template surrunarizes the findings in this 
case: 
Histologic type: Both of the mass lesions consist of poorly 
differentiated non-small cell carcinoma. There are areas that it is 
favored have squamous differentiation, as well as less frequent 
foci suggestive of glandular differentiation (adenocarcinoma). 
Although not entirely identical, the two lesions look similar. 
Histologic grade: Poorly differentiated 
Primary tumor (pT): These two lesions are grossly 2.6 em and 4 em 
in greatest dimension. The 2.6 em in diameter lesion has visceral 
 pleural invasion, with the larger lesion extending very 
peripherally but without definite visceral pleural invasion. 
Although it is difficult to definitely distinguish between 
synchronous primaries and the two masses being part of the same 
process, given the similarities in appearance, based on the new 
guidelines, two nodules of similar histology in the same lobe 
MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION 
would be classified as pT3, Clinical correlation is recommended. 
Margins of resection: The bronchial and vascular resection margins 
are negative. 
Direct extension of tumor: Visceral pleural extension for the 2.6 
em in diameter lesion, no direct extension identified for the larger 
lesion. 
Vascular invasion: Not definitively identified. 
Regional lymph nodes (pN): pNl. There is metastatic carcinoma in 
one of three hilar lymph nodes in part A. The separately submitted 
lymph nodes in parts B, c, D, and E are negative for malignancy. 
Distant metastasis {pM} : pMX 
Other findings: There are inflammatory changes surrounding the 
tumors, with focally prominent pneumonia surrounding the larger 
lesion. 
Note: This case has been reviewed in Intradepartmental consultation 
with all reviewers interpreting the two mass lesions as similar in 
appearance.

KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS
Referring Physician:
Body Site: Lung
Specimen Type :Slides
Clinical Data :Adenocarcinoma
RESULTS :Positive for a p.G12C (c.34G >T) mutation in codon 12
of the KRAS gene.
INTERPRETATION:
Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to correlate with poor
prognosis and resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies in
patients with non-small -cell lung cancer.
COMMENT:
KRAS mutations occur in 15-30% of non-small -cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients and are strongly associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking
history.
This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;
based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are
expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of
the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low
percentage of cells may not be detected.
This test is validated for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and
codon 13 mutations in fresh, frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin
embedded tissue. In particular the test performance has been
established in samples of colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung
carcinoma which harbor these mutations, although several other
tissues are also known to harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of
pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix, etc.).
METHOD/LIMITATIONS:
Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is
selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample ,quantified
and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to
exon 2 of the KRAS gene .PCR products are subjected to single
nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;
primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel
electrophoresis and fluorescence detection .False positive or
negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants
or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

EGFR Mutation Analysis
Referring Physician: .
Body Site: Lung
Clinical Data :Adenocarcinoma
RESULTS: No mutation detected.
INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified in the sample provided
for analysis .Fewer than 5% of non -small cell lung carcinoma
patients without identifiable mutations are reported to be
responsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies. COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more tumor cellularity is optimal
for this mutation analysis .The sample submitted showed 80% tumor
cellularity upon pathologist review.
A frequently occurring sequence change 2361 G>A (Q787Q) was
identified. This polymorphism is known not to have clinical
significance.
Mutations in the tyrosine domain of the epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with differential
responsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)
therapies. The objective response rate among patients with a
sensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%.
This assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain;
based on the current literature, most mutations in non -small-cell
lung carcinoma (NSCLC) are expected to occur in these exons.
Mutations present in less than 10-20% of extracted DNA may not be
detected by this method. Mutation status in a sample may change
during tumor progression or the course of therapy; therefore, this
result cannot be used to infer the presence or absence of a mutation
in another sample or sub -sample obtained from this tumor.
This test is validated for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The
clinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types
is unknown.
METHOD/LIMITATION:
Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is
selected for analysis .DNA is isolated from the samples, quantified
and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to
exons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by
bi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary gel
electrophoresis and fluorescence detection .False positive or
negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants
or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

-pTl N2 Mx "," Site: The specimens are from various locations including the lung, rib, and lymph nodes.

Laterality: The laterality of the specimens is not fully provided, but one lymph node is indicated as pre-carinal, suggesting a mediastinal location on the right side.

Histology: The histological findings include metastatic adenocarcinoma in a lymph node, a primary lung tumor with acinar growth pattern and necrosis, and benign findings in the bone and other lymph nodes.

Stage: Based on the size of the primary lung tumor and the presence of metastasis to a lymph node, the stage is pT1 N2 Mx, indicating that the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes but not to distant organs.

Grade: The grade of the primary lung tumor is moderately differentiated (II).

Behavior: The behavior of the tumor is malignant, as it is a cancer that can invade surrounding tissues and metastasize to other parts of the body.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The specimen consists of a len lung which, in the: inflated state, measures 200 mm in height x 165 x 60 
mm. Fatty and tibrous adhesions are auached to the apex of the: upper lobe where there is a scarred 
area approximately 35 mm in diameter. The pleura is slightly roughened over the mediastinal aspect of 
the upper lobe, approximately 50 mm in ma:-:illluOl dimension, under which a tumour is palpabJe.. Fatly 
tissu-! to a depth of40 mOl is present inferior 10 the bronchial res{""ction margin and this contains 
numerous lymph nodes which are small and black. Numerous large lymph nodes, which measure up to 
35 mOl in maximum dimension. are present superior to the bronchial resection margin. On cut surfaces 
the tumou.r is seen to be 55 mm in maximal dimension. poorly circumscribed, soft and grey and black, 
but with a necrotic centre. It extcnds right up to the pleun.! on the hilar sur£.""\ce of the: lung and also to 
the pleura in the oblique fissure. Tbe tumour appears to be arising from a segmental bronchus. 
probably that of the apicoposterior bronchus of the upper lobe. It is well clear of the bronchial 
re~ction margin. Uninvolved tissue between the tumour and the apex: of the upper lobe is generally 
indurated and that in the ba$lll IIspcct of the lobe is collapsed. Large black lymph nodes arc present 
around major segmcma! bronchi in the lower lobe. No tumour is evident in the lowcr lobe and the 
parenchyma is gencrally normal-appearing lipan from an area approximately 10 mm in maximum 
dimension towards the base which appears fO be an area of haemorrhage. [Lymph nodes inferior to the

Justification: Based on the information provided about tumor size, lymph node involvement, and absence of distant metastasis, this is the correct TNM stage.

Grade: High grade (3)
Justification: The nuclear grade is given as 3, which corresponds to high grade in many systems.

Behavior: Malignant
Justification: This is clear from the context, as the terms carcinoma and malignancy are used throughout the data provided.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ain diagnosis/diagnoses:  
Extensive and locoregionally advanced, central to peripheral, very likely primarily peripheral bronchopulmonary, histologically mixed adenocarcinoma of the right lower lobe of the lung with pleural invasion and metastatic d issemination to both pleural layers and lymph nodes. 
Tumor classification on the basis of this material pT4 pN1 pM1 (P/E) V1 RX, stage IV. C34.3 M 8255/3 G3.  
Comment/supplementary remark:   
Within the main tumor and the lymph node metastases, which are found within the lung in the 
parabronchial region, at the hilus and in sample 5, the large-cell solid tumor component, which has a partly clear -cell character, is predominant. Especially in the area of the main 
tumor margin and the surrounding area the carcinoma shows glandular tubulopapillary and bronchioloalveolar differentiation. No maturation pattern of squamous epithelium is evident on conventional histology (immunohistochemical analysis will follow to provide as definitive confirmation as possible of the bronchopulmonary origin of the tumor and thus exclusion of a late metastatic spread of the reported breast carcinoma). The RX category is explained by the fact that the tumor infiltrating the pleura and disseminated there extends as far as the pleural surface and, with the detection of carcinoma cells in the pleural effusions, the possibility cannot be excluded that some of them remained there. The central bronchus resection line and the resection margins of the large pulmonary vessels and the resection pr eparation of parietal 
pleura itself, as registered under 4., are tumor- free 
  Result of immunohistochemical analysis: a major part of the tumor cells with double expression of low and high molecular weight keratins (M903 and 902). In the glandular differen tiation component, tumor cell nuclei are positive TTF1.  
 The immune profile confirms the diagnosis of an adenocarcinoma of the lung of mixed differentiation.

AILI-J al Investiga11atiire1""Date"," Based on the provided information, here are the answers for the six categories:

Site: The site is the lung, as indicated in the operative information section.

Laterality: The laterality is not explicitly mentioned in the given text, but since there are separate labels for right and left lymph nodes, it can be inferred that the specimens come from both lungs.

Histology: The histology of the mass is not provided in the description, so it cannot be determined with certainty. However, based on the procedures performed (bronchoscopy and thoracoscopy), it could be a lung cancer or another type of lung mass.

Stage: The stage is not provided in the text, as it would require additional information such as the size of the mass and whether it has spread to nearby lymph nodes or other organs.

Grade: The grade is also not provided in the given text. Grade refers to how abnormal the cancer cells look under a microscope and how quickly the cancer is likely to grow and spread.

Behavior: The behavior of the mass cannot be determined without more information, such as whether it is benign or malignant.

Justification for the choices: The site, laterality, stage, grade, and behavior are not explicitly provided in the text, and the histology can only be inferred based on the procedures performed. Therefore, more information is needed to make definitive conclusions about these categories.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GROSS DESCRIPTION 
             A.  Part A is submitted fresh for tissue procurement, 
             labeled ""lingula"".  It consists of an elongated portion of 
    lung tissue, measuring 18 x 4 x 2 cm. maximally.  It has been 
    amputated along an entire edge, which has steel clips and paper tape 
    present.  There is an area of pleural puckering opposite the tape, 
    which has drawn the pleura into a stellate- like area, with a 
    palpable mass deep to that.  The pleura is focally torn along 
    another portion of the specimen.  Black ink is applied over the area 
    of the scar and then the specimen is serially sectioned.  This 
    reveals the presence of a nodular tumor mass immediately beneath the 
    pleura, in the region of the above- mentioned scar.  That tumor mass 
    measures maximally 2 x 1.5 x 1.3 cm.  Sections through the remaining 
    pulmonary parenchyma reveal a consolidated bloody red tissue, 
    without other focal nodules present.  There is some adherent fat 
    present on the pleural surface.  Representative tumor and normal 
    ions are submitted for tissue procurement, per request of 
      Sections after fixation. 
      Part B is submitted fresh, labeled ""Level 10 lymph 
             node"".  It consists of multiple black and red tissue 
    portions.  Three are present, each measuring 6 to 8 mm. in greatest 
    extent.  AS-1

FINAL DIAGNOSIS
A. (Lung, right upper lobe; wedge resection): Squamous cell carcinoma, grade
2, extending to the visceral pleura and measuring 1.9 cm in greatest
dimension.
No convincing lymphatic permeation seen.
Margins of resection free of tumor.
Stage pT2NOMx
Remaining lung without pathologic changes.
B. (Level 7 lymph node; biopsy): Fragments of lymph nodes negative for
metastatic tumor.
C. (Level 4 lymph node; biopsy): Fragments of lymph nodes negative for
metastatic tumor.
D. (Lung, right upper lobe; wedge resection): Segment of benign lung tissue
with subpleural and interstitial fibrosis and chronic inflammation.Aa INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION
A. FROZEN:WEDGE RESECTION RIGHT UPPER LOBE, DISTANT FROM STAPLE LINE: Suture
line is negative for tumor. Grossly, tumor 0.6cm-0.7 cm from stapled margin.
(A91, A92)
GROSS DESCRIPTION
A. The specimen is labeled frozen, wedge resection right upper lobe.
Received fresh is a 22.0 gram, 8.0 x 3.5 x 1.9 cm wedge of lung with a 9.5 cm
staple margin. The pleura is inked blue and the staple margin is submitted
for frozen section with the remnant placed in cassettes A91 and A92. After
the staple margin is removed, the underlying lung parenchyma is inked orange.
There is a 1.9 x 1.7 x 1.5 cm firm white and black nodule causing pleural
puckering and located approximately 0.6 to 0.7 cm from the staple margin.
Sections are submitted as follows: A91 and A92- staplemargin ;A1- tumor
closest to staple margin, A2 and A3 - tumor closest to pleura; A4 remainder
of tumor; A5 - normal lung away from tumor.
B. The specimen is labeled level 7 lymph node. Received in formalin are
multiple fragments of soft tan tissue measuring in aggregate 1.2 x 0.8 x 0.4
cm. The fragments are wrapped and submitted entirely in cassette B1.
C. The specimen is labeled level 4 lymph node. Received in formalin are
multiple small fragments of soft red and black tissue measuring in aggregate
1.3 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm. The specimen is entirely wrapped and submitted in
cassette C1.
D. The specimen is labeled wedge resection, right upper. Received fresh is a
22 gram, 13 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm segment of lung with a 13 cm and 14 cm staple
margin, which are variably located from 1.1 to 2.1 cm apart. The lung
parenchyma is soft, red and unremarkable. No tumor masses are seen. The
pleura is inked blue and the 13 cm margin is submitted in cassettes D1 and D2,
the 14 cm margin is submitted in cassettes D3 and 04 and two representative
sections of the lung are submitted in cassettes D5 and D6.

smoking, The presence of KRAS mutation leads to resistance to EGFR ~ therapies (1). EGFR exon 19 and 21 
mutations are present in about 10% of  and up to 40% in th..-,opulation, common in and 
associated 
with the clinical response to treatment with EGFR inhibitors (2). These mutations are mutually exciusive and 
their presence may have prognostic andlor therapeutic implications (3,4). Clinical studies show high EGFR gene copy 
number by FISH analysis (amplification) to be associated with favorable clinical benefit (clinical response, stable disease, 
time to progression, and survival) In patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase 
inhibitors. 
Approximately 3% of lung adenocarcinomas within the Asian population have an interstitial deletion and inversion in 
chromosome 2p resulting in the EML4IALK fusion gene (ALK+) which is sensitive to AlK inhibitors (5,6). The prevalence 
of this abnormality in the Western population is stili unknown, Detection of this abnormality is critical for identifying 
patients eligible for therapies that target ALK enzymatic activity. EML41ALK rearrangements are mutually exclusive with 
KRAS and EGFR mutations. 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 
SUMMARY STATEMENT 
The posterior segmentectomy demonstrates a 2.5 cm poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma associated with 
angiolymphatic and parietal pleural invasion. Metastatic adenocarcinoma is present in posterior and apical segment 
level 11, level 10 and level 5 lymph nodes. Surgical resection margins are free of tumor. Pathologic stage is T3N2Mx.

MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:  
The specimen is received in three parts, each labeled with the patient's name.  
 1. Part one is received in saline, labeled 'lung, sup erior segment,  
right lower lobe'. It consists of a lobe of the lung measuring 9 x 
 5.5 x 3.5 cm. Two stapled lines are noted measuring 9 cm and 2.5 
cm. The pleura is grey- pink, glistening and mottled lightly with  
fine black streaks. The bronchial margin measures 2 cm and the vascular margin measures 1 cm. Cut surface of the specimen reveals  
a light tan firm nodule measuring 1.5 x 1.4 x 1.2 cm, located 1.5 cm from the overlying pleura and 2 cm from the bronchial resection margin. The remainder of the parenchy ma is pink -red, crepitant  
and blotchy. Representative sections are submitted.  
 2. Part two is received in formalin, labeled '5th rib right'. It consists of a segment of rib measuring 10.5 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm. Scant blood and fibroconnective tissue is attached on the outer surface of bone. The cut surface appears trabeculated and unremarkable.  
Representative sections are submitted in one cassette following  
decalcification.  
 3. Part three is received in saline, labeled 'station 12 lymph node'. It consists of five irregular fragments of tan -brown soft 
tissue ranging from 0.4 to 1.0 cm in greatest dimension and measuring 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm in aggregate. Entirely submitted in one cassette.

ain diagnosis/diagnoses:  
Peripheral bronchopulmonary, histologically mixed adenocarcinoma of the middle with pleural invasion and a second small focus or satellite nodule of a tubular adenocarcinoma  with a small bronchiooalveolar growth component and likewise pleural infiltration (sample 2.)). TNM classification on the basis of this material pT2 pN0 pM1 (PUL) V1 RX, stage IV. C34.2 M8255/3.  
Comment/supplementary remark:   
The tumor classification as adenocarcinoma of the lung showing a predominantl y 
tubulopapillary structural pattern still requires confirmation by appropriate 
immunohistochemical analysis. The classification of the second small tumor focus as a (hematogenous) metastasis that – despite a certain difference in histoarchitecture and cel l 
morphology in places – is based on the structure of the focus, which is lacking the fibrous remodeling or cicatricial zone here that is characteristic of a primary peripheral bronchopulmonary carcinoma. Vascular invasion can be seen in the intratumoral, thick -walled 
pulmonary vessels of the larger tumor, where there is tumor spread with endobronchial occlusion in a subsegmental branch of the bronchus. The R1 classification is explained by the observation that the tumor glands invading the pleura extend as far as the outer surface of the pleura in places and the tumor cells thus remain in the pleural space.    Result of immunohistochemical analysis (both tumor foci)  
CK7 positive throughout, CK20 negative. TTF1.positive (in the smaller focus more than in the larger one), only isolated tumor cells with delicate cell membrane staining for surfactant protein B.  This not only confirms that it is an adenocarcinoma of the lung and, but also supports the view that the smaller focus represents the metastasis of the larger focus  
seen in 1.) and classified as primary tumor.

extending close to the visceral pleura with endobronchial growth in and obstruction of a subsegmental branch of 
B4; distance of endobronchial tumor growth from the bronchus resection plane about 0.9 em. Tumor extending 
close to the staple suture line first described and separated from this by whitish hardened tissue. Other airways 
and rest of parenchyma inconspicuous, only vessels prominent and relatively dilated. Also in S5 a peripheral, 
subpleural compact area, max. 2 em in size, section surfaces pale brownish, max. thickness 0.2 em. 
2.) Interlobar LN (station 11) right: 1 em lesioned node or node part. 
3.) Hilar LN (station 10) right: two lesioned nodes or node parts with some surrounding tissue, 0.6 and 0.2 em. 
4.) Subcarinal LN (station 7): 1.5 em lesioned node or node part some surrounding tissue. 
Examined: 
1.) 1 section of tumor with immediately adjacent visceral pleura, I section of tumor with whitish area to first­
named staple suture line (staple suture line marked green), I section of tumor with endobronchial tumor growth,

Page 4 of 4 "," Based on the surgical pathology report, here is the assessment:

Site: Lung (This is mentioned in the clinical diagnosis)

Laterality: Not provided (The report does not mention whether it is right or left lung cancer)

Histology: Not completely specified, but there is a mention of a ""poorly circumscribed stellate firm gray-white tumor"" which could suggest a carcinoma. However, a definitive histological diagnosis requires further investigation.

Stage: Also not provided in the report. Staging would require additional information such as the size of the primary tumor, involvement of lymph nodes, and presence of metastasis.

Grade: Not provided. This would typically require microscopic examination of tissue samples to assess the degree of differentiation of the cancer cells.

Behavior: Malignant (This is implied by the clinical diagnosis of lung cancer).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tumor Location: left upper lobe 
Tumor Size: 3.6 x 3.4 x 2.9 cm 
Vascular Invasion: extensively present. 
Lymphatic Invasion: extensively present. 
Bronchial Margin: negative 
Vascular Margin: The tumor is present within the perivascular fibroadipose tissue at the pulmonary arterial 
margin. 
Parenchymal Margins: not applicable. 
Pleura/Soft Tissue Margin: The tumor invades through the visceral pleura and is present at the pleural 
adhesion margins. 
Pathologic Stage (AJCC, 7th edition): p stage lilA (T4 N1 MX). 
Additional comments: The tumor is predominantly squamous cell carcinoma with areas of glandular formation 
and signet ring cells. Mucin stains (A6, A8, A 11, A 12) highlight the presence of intra and extracellular mucin. 
Immunohistochemical stains for TTF-1 and p-63 (blocks A8, A11, A4, A10) were used in the evaluation of this 
case. The adenocarcinoma component merge and mingle with the squamous cell carcinoma and represents 
approximately 5-10% of the tumor, consistent with adenosquamous type. EGFR mutation testing will be 
performed and the results reported as an addendum.

Comments
Two peribronchial lymph nodes were identified within specimen #4,
demonstrates a small focus of adenocarcinoma. Therefore, this is
staged as a pN1.
The level 10 lymph nodes left lung, level 7 lymph nodes left lung,
and level 5 lymph nodes left lung were all received fragmented and
therefore an accurate node count cannot be performed.
An elastic stain was performed which demonstrates the adenocarcinoma
to extend up to but not into or through the visceral pleura (with
appropriate positive control).
At the request of the undersigned pathologist, these slides have
been additionally reviewed by Dr. ^ who concurs with the
diagnosis.

ENO OF REPORT 
"," Site: Right upper lobe
 Laterality: Right
 Histology: Squamous cell (epidermoid) carcinoma, keratinizing type
 Stage: pT2aN0MX
 Grade: Moderately differentiated (G2)
 Behavior: Malignant, as indicated by the presence of a primary tumor with invasion into surrounding tissues.

The justification for these choices is based on the provided surgical pathology report, which details the gross and microscopic examination of the specimens received. The report describes a tumor in the right upper lobe, which was identified as squamous cell carcinoma, keratinizing type, and moderately differentiated (G2). The stage was determined to be pT2aN0MX based on the size of the tumor (>3 em but <= 5 em), the absence of regional lymph node metastasis, and the inability to assess distant metastasis. The behavior of the tumor is malignant, as it shows evidence of invasion into surrounding tissues.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Left upper lobe mass. No preoperative tissue diagnosis . 
MACROSCOPIC 
One specimen submitted. 
The specimen is labelled 'left upper lobe wedge resection' and consists of a wedge oflung tissue, 130 x 
70 x 30 mm. The specimen bears a line of staples 110 mm in length. Protruding from one aspect of 
the pleural surface is a palpable mass. The pleura is free and mobile over the mass. 35 mm away from 
this lesion is a firm pleural plaque, 30 mm in diameter. Elsewhere the pleura shows some irregular 
grey and white discolouration. Serial slicing reveals a well defined yellowish white tumour mass, 25 
mm in greatest diameter, approximately 2 mm deep to the pleura. The cut surface shows small areas of 
yellowish necrosis. The tumour is at least 25 mm clear of the stapled surgical margin. No other lesions 
are identified. The uninvolved lung shows severe emphysema. The mass lesion has been sampled for 
Microbiology and for  [IA-IB tumour with overlying pleura; lC-ID pleural _iir decalcification; IE-IF uninvolved lung parenchyma.] 
MICROSCOPY 
Sections reveal a peripherally located moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma demonstrating 
predominantly acinar and focal solid architecture. The tumour is positive for CK7 and TTFI and 
negative for CK20. Zones of geographic necrosis are evident within the confines of the tumour. The 
tumour does not involve the pleura and is macroscopically clear of the intraparenchyma l stapled 
margin. No lymphatic or vascular invasion is identified and no perineural permeation by tumour is 
seen. Immediately adjacent alveolated lung parenchyma shows organising pneumonia and acute 
bronchopneumonia. Remaining lung shows emphysema. Focal areas of pleural and subpleural 
fibroelastotic scarring with calcification are noted. No granulomas are seen. 
SUMMARY 
Left upper lobe wedge resection: 
Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. 
Tumour size 25mm. 
Pleura not involved. 
Clear of margin. 
No lymphatic , vascular or perineural invasion. 
Pathological stage: n. 
Immediately adjacent alveolated lung parenchyma shows organising pneumonia and acute

3. ""Histology"": Squamous cell carcinoma. As stated in the report, the tumor is a squamous cell carcinoma.
4. ""Stage"": pT3N0Mx. The tumor has invaded the primary bronchus (T3), but there's no evidence of lymph node involvement (N0) or distant metastasis (Mx).
5. ""Grade"": Moderately to poorly differentiated. This is based on the report stating ""moderately differentiated"" and also mentioning ""poorly differentiated"" in the paraphrenic extension biopsy.
6. ""Behavior"": Malignant. This is implied as it's a cancerous tumor, which by definition is malignant.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CLINICAL HISTORY AND PRE - OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
M smoker (100 pack -years )with hx of prostate cancer ( ) and
COPD, now with a 1.5 cm RML mixed solid and ground -glass nodule and
multiple additional bilateral lung nodules.
MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received fresh, in six parts, each labeled with the
patient's name.
1. Part one is labeled 'right middle lobe nodule'. It consists of a
wedge shaped portion of lung measuring 11 x 5 x 2 cm. There is a
staple line identified on the specimen, measuring 10 cm in length.
There is a cut identified on the specimen measuring 1.5 cm in
length. On further sectioning there is a gray white ill defined area
measuring 1.1 x 1 cm is identified. This area is 0.3 cm from the
staple line and 0.4 cm from the pleural surface. The staple line is
inked blue. Further sectioning of the lung reveals spongy tan maroon
parenchyma. One portion from the ill defined area is submitted for
frozen section analysis. Representative sections are submitted.
2. Part two is labeled 'station #9 lymph node'. It consists of a
single lymph node measuring 2.4 x 1.5 x 1 cm. The cut surface is
grey-black. Entirely submitted in one cassette.
3. Part three is labeled 'station #10 lymph node'. It consists of
multiple irregular fragments of grey-black lymph nodes measuring 1.5
x 0.8 x 0.5 cm in aggregate. Entirely submitted in one cassette.
4. Part four is labeled 'completion of right middle lobectomy'. It
consists of a lobe of lung measuring 10.5 x 5.5 x 2 cm and weighing
38 grams. Two staple lines, measuring 8 cm and 6 cm in length are
noted. The bronchial and vascular margins are identified. The
serosal surface is grey-purple and shows a subpleural grey-black
nodule measuring 0.9 x 0.8 cm. Sectioning reveals an unremarkable red beefy lung parenchyma. The subpleural nodule likely represents
the lymph node. No discrete mass lesions are noted. Representative
sections are submitted.
5. Part five is labeled 'station #4 lymph node'. It consists of
three irregular segments of grey-black lymph nodes ranging from 0.2
to 0.5 cm in greatest dimension .Entirely submitted in one
cassette.
6. Part six is labeled 'station #7 lymph node'. It consists of a
single grey-black lymph node measuring 0.8 x 0 .5 x 0.3 cm. Entirely
submitted in one cassette.

MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY
KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS
Referring Physician
Body Site :Right middle lobe of lung
Specimen Type: Slides
Clinical Data :Adenocarcinoma
RESULTS: Wild-type gene.
INTERPRETATION:
No mutations were identified at codons 12 and 13 of the KRAS gene.
COMMENT:
Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to be associated with poor prognosis ,and resistance to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor
therapies in patients with non -small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). KRAS
mutations occur in 15-30% of NSCLC patients and are strongly
associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking history.
This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;
based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are
expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of
the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low
percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated
for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and codon 13 mutations in
fresh, frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue. In
particular the test performance has been established in samples of
colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung carcinoma which harbor
these mutations, although several other tissues are also known to
harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of pancreas, bile duct, ovary,
appendix, etc.).
Analysis of EGFR mutation or gene amplification status may provide
additional information regarding this patient's probability of
response to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies, if
clinically indicated. See references.
METHOD/LIMITATION:
Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is
selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified
and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to
exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single
nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;
primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel
electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or
negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants
or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

EGFR Mutation Analysis
Referring Physician:
Body Site :Right middle lobe of lung
Clinical Data :Adenocarcinoma
RESULTS: No mutation detected.
INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified in the sample provided
for analysis .Fewer than 5% of non-small cell lung carcinoma
patients without identifiable mutations are reported to be
responsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies. COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more tumor cellularity is optimal
for this mutation analysis. The sample submitted showed 70% tumor
cellularity upon pathologist review.
A frequently occurring sequence change 2361>GA (Q787Q) was
identified .This polymorphism is known not to have clinical
significance.
Mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with
differential responsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase
inhibitor (TKI) therapies. The objective response rate among
patients with a sensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%.
This assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain;
based on the current literature ,most mutations in non -small-cell
lung carcinoma (NSCLC) are expected to occur in these exons.
Mutations present in less than 10-20 %of extracted DNA may not be
detected by this method .Mutation status in a sample may change
during tumor progression or the course of therapy; therefore, this
result cannot be used to infer the presence or absence of a mutation
in another sample or sub-sample obtained from this tumor.
This test is validated for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The
clinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types
is unknown.
METHOD:
Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is
selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified
and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to
exons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by
bi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary gel
electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or
negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants
or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

INTEGRATED ONCOLOGY
Fluorescence In-Situ Hybridization (FISH)
Referring Physician
Body Site: Right middle lobe of lung
Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma
INTERPRETATION:
Negative for a rearrangement involving the ALK gene.
Probe #Nuclei Examined % Positive Nuclei %
Control values
2p23(ALK) 50 0.0 <15 A total of 50 cells were scored.
FINDINGS:
FISH was performed on paraffin embedded tissue sections using the
Vysis ALK Break Apart Probe for the ALK gene at 2p23 (
FDA approved). When a rearrangement involving ALK is
present, either inversion or translocation, one of the two fusion
signals separates as one red and one green signal. In this
specimen, separated signals were present in 0% of the nuclei scored.
This result is within the normal limits.
COMMENTS: Three to four copies of ALK were observed in 26.0% of
cells. This gain of intact ALK fusion hybridization signals
represents an aneuploid population with extra copies of chromosome
2/2p ALK region .Additional copies of ALK are not uncommon in
NSCLCs, although the significance of extra copies of the ALK gene in
lung carcinoma is unclear at this time (Salido M. et al. J Thorac
Oncol. 2011;6:21-27).

of S6 and S9, max. 8.5 em in size, with a predominantly clear and somewhat arcuate demarcation, extending 
right up to the pleura at the junction S6/8. Opening or truncation of intermediate branches of B8 in the tumor. 
Narrowing of some subsegmental branches ofB6 and B9. Pleura shows diffuse dark discoloration and extensive 
ragged grayish-yellow coating. 
2.) Parietal pleura: flat preparation 8.5 x 3.2 em and up to 0.7 em thick with turbid and patchy brownish 
discoloration, in some areas with ragged grayish-yellow coating of surface. 
3.) Lobar LN (station 12) upper lobe right: 1.8 em lesioned node or node part. 
4.) Lobar LN (station 12) middle lobe right: 2 em lesioned node or node part.

 EVALUATION 
Primary diagnosis/diagnoses: 
Large, intermediate to peripheral bronchopulmonary, histologically poorly differentiated, large-cell and 
polymorphocellular nonkeratinizing squamous cell carcinoma of the right lower lobe of the lung mainly located 
in 88. 
TNM classification according to this picture pT2 pNO pMX RO, stage IB. 034.3 M8070/3. 
Secondary diagnosis/diagnoses: 
Focally marked active chronic inflammation predominantly in the tumor and focal chronic organizing retention 
pneumonia at the tumor margin (sample !.)). Fibrinous chronic granulating and fibrosing visceral (sample 1.)) 
and parietal pleuritis (sample 2.)). Uncharacteristic chronic, predominantly interstitial inflammation and fibrosis 
associated with focal fibrous and small honeycomb-like parenchyma remodeling along the ventrobasalmargin 
of 88. Subpleural accentuated intraalveolar macrophage accumulation in 810 (sample !.)). Lymph nodes with 
uncharacteristic reactive lesions and anthracotic pigment deposits (samples 1.) and 3.)-9.)). 
Remark/addendum: 
An unequivocal infiltration of the visceral pleura cannot be found. The resection margin of the bronchus and 
vessels and all lymph nodes ideutified and excised are tumor-free. 
No asbestos bodies are found in the prepared section planes. But very much further-reaching investigations, 
especially dust analyses, are needed to determine the asbestos exposure of the lung. "," 1. ""Site"": Right lower lobe. Justified as the report clearly mentions the tumor's location in the right lower lobe.

Macroscopy: 
Specimen consists ofa left pneumonectomy specimen measuring 300 x 290 x 58 mm in the 
inflated state. There is an area of adhesion between the upper and lower lobes across the 
oblique fissure. The pleura otherwise appears normal. Located in the upper lobe 25 mm from 
the resection margin is a large well circumscribed firm grey mass measuring 62 nun in 
maximal dimension. It appears to extend across the oblique fissure into the lower lobe. It 
comes close to the external pleural margin but it appears to be clear of it. The tumour shows 
central necrosis and cavitation . Near its most medial aspect of the specimen, several lymph 
nodes show some pale discolouration suggestive of direct invasion by tumour. Adjacent lung 
tissue shows evidence of mild centri-acinar emphysema. The lung tissue distal to the turnouT 
in the lower lobe shows yellow discolouration suggcstive of lipoid pneumonia. [Bronchial

Gross Description: 
Received in a single container labeled wedge 
resection left upper lobe. The specimen consists of a wedge 
resection of the lung measuring 9 x 6 x 1.5 em. The pleural surface 
is yellow to red tan and slightly anthracotic. On sectioning reveals 
a circumscribed white tan firm nodule measuring 2 em in greatest 
dimension that is 0.1 em from.the pleural surface and extends 1 em 
from the resection margin. A representative section was examined at 
the time of surgery. Received with the specimen are cassettes

follows: A frozen section, B shaved resection margin, C through F 
additional sections from nodule. 
Microscopic Description: 
The slides labeled are examined. See diagnosis. 
Final Diagnosis 
Lung, left upper lobe (wedge biopsy): 
Adenocarcinoma: 
moderately differentiated 
measuring 2.0 em in greatest diameter 
· extending up to but not through pleura 
tumor identified within endothelial lined lyrnphovascular space 
areas of fibrosis 
lymph nodes: No lymph nodes resected {see comment) PAS 9 
SPC-A 
CPT: 88307, 88331 
Comments 
The frozen section diagnosis is confirmed. 
In some areas dense fibrosis is present associated with the tumor. 
Although the adenocarcinoma grows along alveolar spaces, the areas of 
fibrosis remove this from the differential diagnosis of a 
bronchoalveolar carcinoma. The tumor focally extends up to the 
pleural surface but does not extend into the pleural surface.

Gross Description 
The specimen is received in multiple parts \'Ii th the first 
received fresh. This consists of a wedge of lung which measures 
approximately 3 em in maximum dimension. Basal margins are 
present. The specimen is sectioned to show a 6 cm calcified 
yellow-white nodule. The specimen is submitted totally after 
decalcification. 
The specimen received as level 2, is received in formalin and is 
designated specimen ""B"". This consists of a single piece of 
gray-black tissue measuring 3 rom in greatest dimension, totally 
submitted. 
The specimen received as left upper lobe is designated specimen 
""C"", and is received fresh. This consists of a lobe of lung which 
weighs 138 gm and measures 14 x 9 x 4.5 cm. The surface shows 
marked puckering of the pleura and this area is inked prior to 
sectioning. The bronchial margins are removed for frozen 
section. Sectioning the lung shows a firm lobulated gray-white 
tumor which is subpleural in location, although grossly does not 
appear to extend through the pleura. The tumor measures 4.1 x 
2.3 x 3 cm. It is located beneath the pleura and approximately 1 
cm from the bronchial resection margin. The lung parenchyma is 
not involved by tumor, it is pink and soft. Sectioning the 
peribronchial tissue shows a large lymph node measuring 1.3 em in 
greatest dimension. This is inked with blue dye and sectioned 
into three parts. A possible additional node is identified. It Page 20f3 
 is placed in cassette 7. Sections have been submitted as

more solid nests of cells within fibrotic stroma. 
B. One slide is examined. These are sections of lymph node characterized by 
moderate sinus histiocytosis and anthracosis. There is no evidence of 
involvement by tumor. 
C. Eight slides are examined. Sections of lung include residual tumor 
(slides 5 and 6 ). composed of abnormal glands. There is surrounding 
pneumonitis with aggregated foamy histiocytes present within alveoli. 
associated with interstitial infiltration by inflammatory cells. including 
lymphocytes. plasma cells and eosinophils. Sections of the second-described 
mass (block C3) reveal a circumscribed. but non-encapsulated. nodular mass. 
composed of a monotonous population of cells having ovoid to spindle-shaped 
nuclei. arranged in a nested/organoid pattern. The cells have bland chromatin 
I'lith inconspicuous nucleoli. Mitotic figures are not readily identified. The 
grossly-described bullous area is characterized by irregular disruption of the 
subpleural alveolar architecture. associated with irregular fibrous thickening 
of the pleura. I'lhich is infiltrated by chronic inflammatory cells. including 
lymphocytes and plasma cells. forming occasional loose aggregates. Clusters 
of pigmented histiocytes are present within the dilated alveolar spaces. 
Random sections of lung reveal mild patchy dilation of alveoli. most notably 
within the peripheral portions of the parenchyma. No other tumor is 
identified. Sections of the bronchial margin are lined by ciliated. 
pseudostratified columnar epithelium with areas of squamous metaplasia. The 
vascular margin of resection is uninvolved by tumor. A peribronchial lymph 
node is characterized by sinus histiocytosis and anthracosis. There is no 
morphologic evidence of involvement by tumor. 
D. One slide is examined. including the entirely submitted specimen. These 
are sections of a biopsy portion of lung. composed of benign alveolar 
parenchyma. There is adherent fibrofatty tissue. consistent with parietal 
pleura. There is no evidence of involvement by tumor. No lymph node is 
identified. 
E. One slide is examined. These are sections of clotted blood and organizing 
fibrin. A few clusters of mildly reactive mesothelial cells are focally 
present within the clot. occasionally forming gland-like structures. No lymph

Gross Description
The specimens are received in ten containers, each labeled with the patient's name and medical record number.
The first specimen is further designated as ""level IX lymph node"". It consist of two fragments of yellow/tan fibroadipose tissue
measuring 1.1 x 0.8 x 0.2 and 1.0 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm. Blue surgical dye is noted in one of the tissue fragments. This tissue
fragment is submitted in its entirety in cassette Al, and the remaining tissue fragment is submitted in cassettes A2.
The second specimen is additionally designated as ""level Vill lymph node"", it consist of a fragment
yfibroadipose tissue measuring 1.2 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm. A second smaller apparent lymph node is included which mle
measures 0.6cm in greatest dimension. One dissection of the larger tissue fragment reveals a single possible anthracotic l y m p h node
measuring 0.6 cm. The entire specimen is submitted in cassette B1. yp
The third specimen is further designated as ""level V lymph nodes"". It consist of a single possible lymph node
measuring 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm. The specimen is submitted whole in cassette C1.

examination. The specimen has been previously opened to reveal a heterogenous white/tan mass measuring 7.0 x 5.5 x
5.3 cm.. The lesion appears to multi focally abut the surface; however, no gross invasion is identified. The mass shows
multi focal areas of apparent hemorrhage and necrosis. The white/tan mass- grossly appears to approach within 0.3 cm of
the nearest stapled surgical resection margin. The staple line is inked blue and removed. Radial section demonstrating
the relationship of the mass to the inked resection margin is submitted in cassette J4. Sectioning through the mass
reveals multiple small cavities containing a yellow/brown purulent appearing fluid. A single darkly pigmented apparent
lymph node is identified in.the hilar region which measured approximately 2.1 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm.

PART #1: LEFT UPPER LOBE
Resident Pathologist:
Thpecimen is received fresh labeled with the patient's name
and designated as left upper lobe. It consists of a grossly
i entifiable lobectomy specimen, measuring 18.0 x 8.2 x 3.3 cm and
weighing in aggregate 163 gm. In the epical half, on the lateral
aspect of the lobe, is a tumor mass, measuring 4.5 cm in greatest
dimension. The mass has an irregular infiltrating border and involves
the pleural surface, such that the pleura is puckered in the area
overlying the tumor. This area of puckering measures 2.5 cm in
greatest dimension. The tumor is approximately 0.5 cm from the hilar
bronchial margin and appears grossly to involve large branches of the
right upper lobe bronchus and blood vessels. On cut section, the
tumor is tan-white and gray, marbleized in appearance. There are two
staple lines on the specimen. The epical staple line measures 4.5 cm
in length and the more inferior staple line measures 6.0 cm in length.
The tumor approaches to within 0.5 cm of the epical staple line. The
staple lines are removed and the lung parenchyma adjacent is inked
blue. The pleural surface overlying the tumor has been inked black.
The specimen is serially sectioned, revealing no other lesions.
Representative sections are submitted.

TISSUE DESCRIPTION:
Right middle lobe lung (4.8 x 1.2 x 1 cm) and right lower lobe lung with portion
of middle
lobe and posterior segment of right upper lobe (250 grams) and superior
mediastinal (right
lower paratracheal), inferior mediastinal (subcarinal, right lower paratracheal)
and N1
(interlobar) lymph nodes
Al, A2, A3, A4, 81, 82, 83, 84, B5, B6,B7, B8,89, 810
DIAGNOSIS:
Lung, right lower lobe with portion of middle lobe and posterior segmentof right
upper lobe,
lobectomy: Invasive grade 4 (of 4) adenocarcinoma, with sarcomatoid
differentiation, forming a
3.5 x 3.5 x 3 cm mass centered on the interlobar fissure and involving both upper
and lower
lobes.The bronchial margin and multiple (3) intrapulmonary peribronchial lymph
nodes are
negative for tumor.
Lung, right middle lobe, wedge excision: Atypical lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate,
suspicious for
low grade B-cell lymphoma. Definitive diagnosis and classification will be
reported in an
addendum.
Lymph nodes, N1, excision: Multiple N1 (3 of 3 interlobar) lymph nodes involved by
metastatic
adenocarcinoma.
Lymph nodes, superior, inferior mediastinal, excision: Multiple superior
mediastinal (2 right
lower paratracheal), inferior mediastinal (2 subcarinal, 2 paraesophageal) lymph
nodes are
negative for tumor.
ADDENDUM:
Immunoperoxidase studies were performed on paraffin sections of the right middle
lobe biopsy
using antibodies directed against the following antibodies: CD20, C03, kappa and
lambda
immunoglobulin light chains. There is a mixed population of Co20-positive B-
lymphocytes and
CD3-positive T-lymphocytes distributed in a pattern typical of reactive
hyperplasia. A
polytypic pattern of immunoreactivity for immunoglobulin light chains is seen in
mature plasma
cells.The findings support a diagnosis of reartivp lvmohoid hyperplasia.

GROSS DESCRIPTION 
             A.  Part A  is submitted fresh for frozen labeled ""R4 lymph 
             node"" consists of multiple fragments of tan- white and 
    yellow tissue admixed with anthracotic pigment.  The aggregate 
    measurement is 4 x 2 x 0.5 cm.  Submitted entirely for frozen 
    section. 
             B.  Part B is submitted fresh for frozen labeled ""L4 lymph 
             node"" consists of multiple fragments of gray- red and yellow 
    tissue with an aggregate dime f 2 x 2 x 0.5 cm.  Submitted 
    entirely for frozen section.  
             C.  Received fresh,  ""level 10 lymph node"", are two 
             slightly rubbery gray- black-red tissues, in keeping with 
    lymph nodes, measuring 0.35 cm. in greatest dimension and 0.7 x 0.5 
    x 0.5 cm.  The larger tissue is bisected and the specimens are 
    entirely submitted in two blocks, as labeled.  AS-2 
 
    BLOCK SUMMARY:  1 - Smaller node in toto; 2 - bisected larger node. 
 
             D.  Received fresh, labeled ""level 5 lymph node"", are two 
             slightly rubbery gray- black-red tissues, in keeping with 
    lymph nodes, averaging 1.1 x 0.6 x 0.6 cm.  The specimens are 
    bisected and entirely submitted independently in two blocks (one 
    bisected node per cassette).  AS-2 
             E.  Received fresh, labeled ""subcarinal lymph node"", are 
             four slightly rubbery tan- gray-red tissues, in keeping with 
    lymph nodes, measuring up to 0.6 cm. in greatest dimension.  The 
    specimens are submitted in toto in one block.  AS-1 
             F.  Received fresh, labeled ""level 6 lymph node"", are two 
             soft tan- red to gray- black tissues, in keeping with lymph 
    nodes, measuring 0.5 and 2.4 cm. in greatest dimension, with a scant 
    amount of associated adipose tissue.  The larger node is bisected 
    and the specimens are entirely submitted in two blocks, as labeled. 
    AS-2 
 
    RY:  1 - Smaller node in toto; 2 - bisected larger node. 
    
  
  
             G.  Left lung submitted fresh for tissue procurement 
             labelled ""left lung"" is an intact lung with two lobes 
    weighing 442 grams.  There is a suture line present at the 
    amputation point of the main left bronchus, the left main pulmonary 
    artery and main left pulmonary vein.  The pleural surface of the 
    lung is intact with a finely stippled anthracotic pigment present. 
    No obvious areas of puckering of the pleura or umbilication are 
    evident.  Several small possible peribronchial lymph nodes are 
    present adjacent to the bronchial stump.  There is a mass that is 
    palpable in the interlobar fissure.  This appears to be below the 
    surface of the lung.  Sections are placed through the mass and this 
    reveals a large tumor mass which is immediately inferior to the main 
    bronchus.  The tumor mass measures maximally 6 x 5 x 4 cm.  It 
    arises approximately 1 cm below the bronchial cuff margin that 
    grossly does not appear to be involved by tumor.  There does appear 
    to be at least one lymph node which is partially involved by tumor 
    adjacent the bronchus.  Portions of the t ormal lung are 
    submitted for procurement per request of   Further 
    sectioning of the lung reveals a second t present deep to 
    the pleural surface of the lower lobe.  This pleural mass as central 
    necrosis and measures maximally 3 x 2 x 1.5 cm.  It has the same 
    fleshy  tan- white gritty cut surface as does the main tumor mass. 
    The upper lobe does not appear to have any discrete nodules.  It is 
    crepitant gray- tan tissue without focal nodularity.  Sections after 
    fixation. 
    BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 - bronchial margin; 2 - vascular margin; 3 - 
    pleural margin of the main dominant tumor mass; 4- 7 - dominant tumor 
    mass; 8-10 - secondary smaller tumor including pleural surface; 11 - 
    random left upper lobe; 12 - random left lower lobe; 13- 14 - 
    bronchial lymph nodes. 
 
     
 
MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION 
             Microscopic sections of both lesions present in the left 
             lung have a similar histologic appearance.  Both are 
    moderate to poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas with cells 
    exhibiting prominent eosinophilic cytoplasm.  It is not clear from 
    the histology if this represents two separate primary tumors or an 
    intrapulmonary metastasis from the main lung tumor.  Results of the 
    evaluation of the lung are summarized in the following template: 
 
    Histologic type:  Adenocarcinoma. 
    Histologic grade:  Moderate to poorly differentiated. 
    Primary tumor (pT):  Two lesions are present.  The larger lesion 
    measures 6 x 5 x 4 cm., the smaller lesion 3 x 2 x 1.5 cm. (pT2). 
    Margins of resection:  Bronchial and vascular margins of resection 
    are free of tumor.  Visceral pleural surface free of tumor. 
    Direct extension of tumor:  Absent. 
    Venous (large vessel) invasion:  Negative. 
    Arterial (large vessel) invasion:  Negative. 
    Lymphatic (small vessel) invasion:  Negative. 
    Regional lymph nodes (pN):  Two of six bronchial lymph nodes contain 
    metastatic adenocarcinoma (2/6).  All mediastinal lymph nodes are 
       negative (pN1). 
    Distant metastasis (pM):  Cannot be assessed (pMX).

    A.  Lymph node, R4, resection: 
          Negative for malignancy. 
 
    B.  Lymph node, L4, resection: 
          Negative for malignancy. 
 
    C.  Lymph node, level 10, resection: 
          Negative for malignancy.

    F.  Lymph node, level 6, resection: 
          Negative for malignancy. 
 
    G.  Lung, left pneumonectomy: 
          Multicentric, moderate to poorly differentiated 
          adenocarcinoma.  Bronchial, vascular and visceral pleural 
          surfaces are free of involvement by tumor. 
          Two of six peribronchial lymph nodes contain metastatic 
          adenocarcinoma (2/6).

fresh for frozen section diagnosis.The surgeon changed his mind. The pleura is pink/tan
and spongy to red with anthracotic marbling. The lung is sectioned to have a 1.5 x 1.5 x
1.0 cm tumor mass. The mass appears circumscribed and possibly within a vessel. The mass
is 2.0 cm from the bronchial margin and does not involve the pleura. The tumor appears to
have an adjacent smaller nodule, which ranges up to 0.5 cm. The lung is sectioned fresh to
have a peripheral pink/tan spongy appearance on the anterior surface in the superior
aspect.The tumor has a central location adjacent to the hilar structures. There is focal
scant mucin filled bronchioles in the area of the tumor. The parenchyma demonstrates mild
congestion inferiorly. No additional masses or lesions are identified. Sections are
sampled as labeled in the following cassettes:

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:
A.Sections of the mass 'grossly described demonstrate an invasive
malignant epithelial neoplasm .The tumor is composed of infiltrating
nests of somewhat polygonal cells with distinct cell borders with
cells containing a small to moderate amount of cytoplasm and enlarged
nuclei with nuclear pleomorphism .There are nests with central
necrosis .There are also rare neoplastic cells with dense
eosinophilic cytoplasm .There is no definite lymphovascular
invasion .The tumor is seen closely approaching ,but not involving,
the pleural surface. Focal vague lumina differentiation is noted.
Immunohistochemistry stains are obtained and the neoplastic cells are
positive with cytokeratin 5, positive with cytokeratin 7, negative
with cytokeratin 20, negative staining with TTF-1, strong nuclear
staining with p63, and negative staining of the tumor cells with
Napsin-A. The remainder of the lung demonstrates mild interstitial
fibrosis with mildly thickened alveolar septae.
B.Multiple sections are examined and sections of the bronchial surgical
margins are free of tumor. The vascular margins are also free of
tumor. No peribronchial lymph node is identified .Sections of the
lung at the previous wedge resection site demonstrates hemorrhage
with no residual tumor. Random sections of the lung demonstrate mild
fibrosis and bronchiectasis.
C.Sections demonstrate fragments of a benign lymph node with mild
anthracotic pigment .There is no malignancy.
D.Sections are of fragments of a benign lymph node with similar
findings as described above .There is no malignancy.
E.Sections are of fragments of a benign lymph node with similar
findings as described above.There is no malignancy. 4060

Sections show a moderately differentiated, focally keratinizing squamous 
cell carcinoma demonstrating extensive tumor necrosis. Pleural and 
vascular invasion are not identified. Lymphatic invasion is present 
focally (confirmed by D2-40 immunohistochemical staining for lymphatic 
endothelium),.but lymph node metastases are not identified. The patient• · s history of previous oropharyngeal squamous carcinoma is noted, but 
slides are not available for comparison. Assuming the present tumor to 
be a primary pulmonary tumor rather than a ··metastatic lesion, the 
pathologic stage is assessed as pT2NO.

   Gross Description:  
Received are six separate formalin filled containers each l abeled with the  
patient's  name.  
 
Part A is additionally labeled ""A, level VII lymph node."" The specimen consists  
of a single fragment of gray -black soft tissue that has dimensions of 1 x 0.8 x  
0.3 cm. Submitted in toto in cassette A.  
 
Part B is additionally labeled ""B, right upper lobe mass."" Please note a portion  
of this tissue has been banked at the tissue bank and a portion has been  
sent to diagnostics . The specimen consists of a previously incised and  
sectioned portion of lung wedge that has overall reconstructed dimensions of  9 x 
3.5 x 3.5 cm. The pleural surface ranges from pink -tan, smooth and glistening to  
purple- red-brown and focally hemorrhagic. Upon sectioning, there is a solid,  
ill-defined, tan- white mass that has dimensions of 3 x 2.5 x 2 cm. This mass  
grossly comes to within 0.1 cm from the pleural surface but does not appear  
grossly to be penetrating the pleura. This mass is grossly present at the  
stapled surgical margin. A representative section of this mass is taken for  
frozen section diagnosis and is resubmitted entirely in cassette B1. Additional  
sections of mass to include pleura are submitted in cassettes B2- 3. Sections of  
tumor to staple line in cassette B4. The uninvolved lung is tan- brown and spongy  
to focally red, hemorrhagic and congested. No additional lesi ons are identified  
within this portion of lung. Representative section of uninvolved lung in  
cassette B5.  
 
Part C is additionally labeled ""C, right upper lobe margin."" The specimen consists of a lung wedge that has dimensions of 11 x 2 x 1.5 cm. There is a  
surgical staple line traversing one aspect of the specimen. The pleura surface 
ranges from tan- gray, smooth and glistening to red- brown, granular and  
hemorrhagic. There is an area designated by the surgeon at the time of frozen  
section as the previous sit e nearest the tumor. This area is frozen at the time 
of frozen section and is resubmitted in cassette C1. Additional sectioning of  
the wedge reveals an ill -defined, tan- brown mass present at the margin. This  
mass has dimensions of 2 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm. An addi tional section of this mass is  
submitted in cassette C2.  
 
Part D is additionally labeled ""D, 4R lymph node"" and consists of a single  
fragment of gray -tan fibrofatty soft tissue that has dimensions of 0.4 x 0.3 x  
0.2 cm. Submitted in toto in cassette D.  
 Part E is additionally labeled ""E, 2R lymph node"" and consists of two fragments  
of gray -yellow fibrofatty soft tissue that have overall dimensions of 0.8 x 0.5  
x 0.3 cm. Submitted in toto in cassette E.  
 Part F is additionally labeled ""F, right upper lobe margin #2, stitch marks

Results 
Sample Preparation 
For cytology samples, extraction of DNA was performed from the fluid or sample provided. For surgical specimens, 
microdissection was performed to include neoplastic tissue and normal adjacent tissue, O~tical density readings were obtained. 
Gene Seguencing 
peR was performed using primers that flank exon 1 in the KRAS gene and exon 19 and 21 of the EGFR gene, Analysis of the 
peR products was first performed for the EGFR 19 to detect aberrant length peR product. A sequencing analysis, using the 
Big Dye Terminator Kit (Applied 8iosystems, Inc,) was then performed, The known hotspots were analyzed for the presence of 
mutations, 80th forward and the reverse seqllencin~ was performed.

 Microscopy 
Re 1.) Immediate intraoperative evaluation ): metastasis of squamous cell carcinoma. 
After paraffin embedding. 
Lymph node sections with extensive infiltration by atypical epithelia arranged in differing sizes of partly 
branched and vaguely epidennoid or concentrically layered solid structures. Moderately wide to wide, pale to 
moderately eosinophilic cytoplasm. Focally recognizable intercellular bridges. Nuclei round to oval, partly with 
somewhat inegular contours, mostly moderately, but focally also markedly anisomorphic, with enlarged 
chromatin, differing sizes of nucleoli and numerous mitoses. Surrounding desmoplastic stroma. Small focal 
inclusion of necrosis. 
Re 2.) Immediate intraoperative evaluation ): squamous cell dysplasia up to severity of a squamous 
cell carcinoma in situ with spread to bronchial glands, no evidence of invasive growth rapid sections. 
After paraffin embedding. 
Tumor made up of atypical epithelia described in 1.). Focal dyskeratoses or vague pearly bead formation. 
Isolated nuclei also deformed. Multifocal necroses of differing extent. Middle lobe bronchus segmentally 
obstructed by the tumor and in large pa1ts destroyed, here continuous infiltration of para bronchial lymph nodes. 
Spread to the visceral pleura, which is markedly enlarged by fibrosis in parts, but not unequivocally infiltrated. 
In many places invasion of small blood vessels in the tumor and tumor margin. Proximal to the tumor 
obstruction in the middle lobe bronchus and also at the bronchus resection margin partial replacement of the 
respiratory epithelium by enlarged atypical squamous epithelium extending to the secretory ducts and bronchial 
glands with the squamous disorder mostly reaching well into the upper third or to the surface. Nuclei irregularly 
arranged, in most cases slightly to moderately anisomorphic, but with foci of relatively marked anisomorphism, 
and formation here and there of keratin lamellae and pearly beads. Vessel resection margins and hilar lymph 
nodes tumor-free. In S5 incompletely inflated alveolar lung tissue in parts with relatively extensive intraalveolar 
erythrocyte extravasates. 
Otherwise in many places the alveolar lumina and partly also the lumina of bronchioles are occupied with 
moderately dense macrophages, some transformed into foam cells, some pale brown and with frne granular 
blackish pigmentation. In multifocal parabronchial vessels and in interlobular septa lymph follicles and small 
patches of relatively dense lymphomonocytic infiltrates. In SIO mostly only a few intraalveolar macrophages. 
Re 3.) Immediate intraoperative evaluation (  resection margin to main bronchus + upper lobe 
bronchus in each case tumor-free and free of dysplastic epithelial lesions. 
After paraffin embedding: 
Bronchial sections with focal replacement of respiratory epithelium by immature squamous epithelium at the 
margin to the main and upper lobe bronchus. Stroma with increase in elastic fibers. To some extent somewhat 
prominent seromucous glands. Strands of typical hyaline cartilage. Close to the distal resection margin only 
sections of atypical squamous epithelium preserved or registered at the surface as described under 2.), here 
likewise focal spread in glandular ducts. 
Re 4.) -7.) Lymph nodes with intact basic structure, inconspicuous lymphatic cell content with formation of 
activated follicles and slight to moderate deposits of blackish granular pigment and some small anisotropic 
particles within macrophages. 
EVALUATION 
Primary diagnosis/diagnoses: relatively large, central to peripheral bronchopuhnonary, histologically 
moderately differentiated, large-cell, slightly keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma of the middle lobe. 
TNM classification pT2 pNJ. VI RO, stage IIB. 
C 34.2 M 8070/3 
Secondary diagnosis/diagnoses: slight chronic retention pneumonia peripheral to the tumor in S5. Lymph 
nodes with uncharacteristic reactive lesions and anthracotic pigment deposits (samples 2.) and 4.)-7.)). 
Remark/addendum: the tumor shows obliterative segmental growth in the middle lobe bronchus and has 
spread to the mucosal surface right to the central bronchus resection line of sample 2.) and to the distal sections 
of repeat bronchial resection material in sample 3.). The resection margin tot he main and upper lobe bronchus 
of sample 3.) is free of dysplastic epithelial changes. Lymph node metastases are seen in sample 1.) and 
parabronchially in sample 2. ). The other lymph nodes removed and the vessel resection margins of the main 
preparation are tumor-free. An unequivocal infiltration of the visceral pleura cannot be demonstrated.

MACROSCOPIC 
Four specimens received 
1: The specimen is labelled 'left upper lobe' and consists of a lobe of lung (132 x 85 x 
70), weighing 381 grams in the fixed state. Adherent to the visceral surface is a strip 
of parietal pleura measuring 127 x 52 mm. Within the parenchyma is a large cream 
tumour mass. The tumour comprises a relatively circumscribed cream nodule with 
areas of necrosis (57 mm in maximum diameter), merging with an ill-defined firm 
cream to tan area. The maximum diameter of the entire lesion (discrete nodule plus 
ill-defined area) measures 91 mm. The tumour invades visceral pleura and is adherent

2: The specime n is labelled 'right lung lower and middle' and consists of the right middle and lower 
lobes as stated. The lower lobe measures 155 x 100 x 40 nun and the middle lobe 135 x 90 x 30 mm. 
There is a stapled resection margin along the middle lobe, 150 mm in length. A rounded endobronc hial 
tumour plug extends to the bronchial resection margin, however there is no attachment to the bronchial 
wall in this region. The pleural surface appears indurated and tethered on the anterior apical part of the 
lower lobe over an area approximately 25 x 30 mm. Sectioning reveals a tumour within the apical 
segment of the lower lobe measuring 50 x 45 x 45mm with endobronchial extension up to a distance of 
40mm. The entire lesion measuring approximately 75mm in maximal dimension . The endobronchial 
plug of tumour extends to involve the proximal portion of the middle lobe bronchus and is focally 
tethered to the wall at this point. The alveolated parenchyma of the middle lobe appears clear of 
tumour and no tumour is present at the stapled resection margin. The endobronchia l plug of tumour 
also extends up the bronchus to the bronchial resection margin. However, as mentioned previously the 
tumour is not attached to the bronchial wall in this region. A peribronchial lymph node appears to be 
involved by tumour, possibly by direct extension. The bronchial and peribronchial resection margins 
appear macroscopically clear of the tumour. Localised broncruectasis is present distal to the 
endobronchial tumour plug. [2A, 5 hilar lymph nodes; 2B, bronchial resection margin en face; 2C-D,

2: Sections reveal a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma involving the apical segment of the 
right lower lobe with extensive endobronchial extension. The tumour does not invade the visceral 
pleura. The bronchial resection margin is clear of tumour. Tumour extends into peribronchial 
connective tissue adjacent to the resection margin but is 0.3mm clear of the peribronchial resection 
margin. Within peribronchial connective tissue in this region perineural penneation by turnOUT is 
identified. The involved nerve measures 350um in diameter and in the section examined is 1.3mm

nodes also show evidence of sinus histiocytosis, carbon pigment deposition, fibrosis and scattered 
flecks of birefringent material consistent with silicate. Within adjacent lung parenchyma there is 
bronchiectasis with mucoid plugging and focal endogeno us lipoid pneumonia consistent with 
obstructive pneumonitis. The seclion of right middle lobe alveolated lung parenchyma shows  bronchiectasis with mucoid plugging, however no tumour is identified. Rare mixed duct macules are 
present within the remaining alveolated lung parenchyma which is otherwise unremark able.

carbon pigment deposition, fibrosis and scattered flecks of birefringent material consistent wilh silicate. 
No tumour is identified. 
SUMMARY 
1-3: Right lower and middle lobes, separately submitted No. 7 lymph node: 
Poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma involving the apical segment of the right lower lobe. 
Tumour size 75mm in maximal dimension. 
Extensive endobronchial extension by tumour, endobronchia l tumour attached at origin of right middle 
lobe bronchus (macroscop ic finding). 
Visceral pleura nol involved. 
Resection margins clear of tumour. 
Perineural penncation by tumour within peribronchial tissue adjacent to margin (see microscopic 
description). 
Lymphatic invasion present 
No vascular invasion seen. 
Peribronchial lymph node involved by tumour, no tumour in separately submitted No.7 lymph node. 
Pathological stage: T2 N I. 
Bronchiectasis and focal endogenous lipoid pneumonia in adjacent lung parenchyma. 
T-28000 M-80703 PI-03000 
"," Site: Right lower and middle lobes
Justification: The specimen includes tissue from these two lung lobes and the pathology report describes tumor involvement in both locations.

Laterality: Right
Justification: The description of the specimen and the pathology report consistently refer to structures on the right side of the body, e.g., ""right lower lobe"" and ""right middle bronchus.""

Histology: Poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma
Justification: The pathology report states that the tumor is a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma.

Stage: T2 N1
Justification: The pathology report describes the tumor as having a maximal dimension of 75 mm, invading peribronchial connective tissue but not the visceral pleura, and involving a peribronchial lymph node. These features are consistent with a T2 N1 stage.

Grade: Not provided
Justification: The pathology report does not provide information on the grade of the tumor.

Behavior: Malignant
Justification: Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of lung cancer that is typically malignant, and the pathology report describes extensive endobronchial extension and lymphatic invasion, which are also indicative of malignancy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

M
ain diagnosis/diagnoses:  
Very extensive, pneumonia-like, imposing bronchopulmonary mixed adenocarcinoma with a 
predominantly tubulopapillary and bronchioloalveolar pattern, as well as slight mucin formation and formation of numerous, in parts very s mall foci within the parenchyma and 
minimal pleural invasion and lymphogenous metastatic spread.   
Comment/supplementary remark:   
By definition, the foci of mixed adenocarcinoma detected not only in the immediate 
environment of the tumor, but in some cases only at microscopic level, are to be classified satellite nodes in the ipsilateral lobe, which -  bearing in mind the location of the lymph node micrometastases (samples 5.), 7.) and very probably also 1.)), as well as the absence of tumor in the resectio n margins of the bronchus and the vessels - gives a tumor classification of pT4 
pN1 R0. But in view of the presentation of the tumor and the partial bronchioloalveolar differentiation, the interpretation can be just as easily be supported or perhaps even f avored 
that this is a primary multifocal tumor manifestation. This would correspond to pT2(m). The stage grouping IIIB thus competes with IIB. The main tumor mass lies in segments 6 and 9 of the resected right lower lobe. The largest of the metastases foun d in the regional lymph nodes 
is 1.2 mm. The coding is C 34.3; M 8255/3.    
"," 1. ""Site"": Lung. Justified as the report clearly states the tumor is located in the right lower lobe.
2. ""Laterality"": Right. Justified as the report mentions the tumor is located in the right lower lobe.
3. ""Histology"": Mixed adenocarcinoma with a predominantly tubulopapillary and bronchioloalveolar pattern, and slight mucin formation. Justified as the report describes the tumor as a bronchopulmonary mixed adenocarcinoma with these specific characteristics.
4. ""Stage"": The report suggests two possible stages: pT4 pN1 R0 or pT2(m). As the final decision is not made, I would say ""not provided"".
5. ""Grade"": Not provided as the report does not mention any information about the differentiation of the tumor.
6. ""Behavior"": Malignant. Justified as the report mentions lymphogenous metastatic spread and partial bronchioloalveolar differentiation, indicating the tumor is invasive and has the ability to spread.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clinical Notes: 
Left upper lobectomy: apical lung carcinoma. 
Station 5 lymph node. 
Two specimens are received: 
1: LEFT UPPER LOBE 
Macroscopy: 
Specimen is labelled ""left upper lobe"" and consists of a lobe of lung measuring 180 x 100 x 40 mm. 
Enlarged peribronchial lymph nodes are seen at the resection margin. No endobronchial abnormality is 
seen. The pleural surface appears normal except for at the apex where there is a subpleural tumour 
measuring 30 mrn in maximum diameter. There is a fibrofatty adhesion, measuring 25 x 8 x 5 mrn, at 
the apical surface of the tumour. The tumour is moderately well circumscribed, solid and cream in 
colour witli numerous small areas of necrosis seen. Non-neoplastic parenchyma displays no 
abnormality. [Bronchial resection margin, A; peribronchial lymph nodes transected and BIT, B-D; RS 
of tumour, E-H; apical non-neoplastic parenchyma, I; lingula parenchyma, J]. 
Microscopy: 
Sections show a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma which invades the pleura in the region of the 
fibro fa tty adhesion. Vascular invasion is also noted. Focally the tumour has a cystic architecture with 
papillary infolding into the cyst lumen, but it is a predominantly solid tumour. There is extensive 
replacement of peribronchial lymph nodes by metastatic poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, and 
transcapsular extension of tumour is noted. Tumour emboli are noted in lymphatics in surrounding 
fibrofatty tissue. The bronchial resection margin is well clear of malignancy. Non-neoplastic lung 
parenchyma shows changes of respiratory bronchiolitis. 
2: NUMBER 5 LYMPH NODE 
Macroscopy: 
Specimen is labelled ""number 5 lymph node"" and consists of a lymph node measuring 20 mrn in 
maximum diameter. The cut surface shows a solid white nodule at one pole of the lymph node 
measuring 4 mrn in diameter. [Transected and BIT, 2A]. [

Lung nodule  
 MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:  
The specimen is received in six parts, each labeled with the  
patient's name.  
 1. Part one is received fresh, labeled 'left upper lobe'. It  
consists of an 11 x 7.5 x 3 cm lung wedge resection with a stapled  
margin measuring 7 cm in length. Two defects made by the surgeon are  
noted. The first defect measures 1.5 cm in length and the second  
defect measures 1.8 cm in length. The pleural surface is otherwise  
smooth and glistening. The surgical margin is inked black and the  
pleural surface is inked blue. In the first defect area, a 1.4 cm  
relatively well -circumscribed, tan- white, firm nodule, located 1.3  
cm from the surgical margin and 0.2 cm from the pleural surface is  
noticed. In the second defect, a 2 x 1 cm, tan- white, firm nodule is  
noted. This nodule is 1.5 cm from the surgical margin and 0.2 cm  
from the pleura. Other areas of lung parenchyma show patchy  
congestion. Representative sections are submitted.  
 
2. Part two is received in saline, labeled 'completion of left upper  
lobe'. It consists of a partial lobectomy measuring 18 x 7 x 3.5 cm.  
The specimen weighs 136 g. The specimen contains a stapled margin  
measuring 15 cm, which is inked in blue. After the stapled margin  
is removed, the underlying surface is inked in green. The pleural  
surface is inked in black. The specimen is serially sectioned and no  
 masses are identified. The lung parenchyma consists of tan- pink to 
tan-gray spongy parenchyma. Representative sections are submitted.  
 
3. Part three is received in saline, labeled 'station 13 lymph  
node'. It consists of two black lymph nodes measuring 1.6 x 1.2 x  
0.3 cm and 1 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm. The lymph nodes are bisected and  
entirely submitted in 3A.  
 4. Part four is received in saline, labeled 'level 9 lymph node'. It  
consists of two black lymph nodes, both measuring 0.8 x 0.5 x 0.2  
cm. The specimen is entirely submitted.  
 
5. Part five is received in saline, labeled 'level 5 lymph node'. It  
consists of three black lymph nodes ranging in size form 0.4 cm to 1.2 cm in greatest dimension. The specimen is submitted in toto. 
 6. Part six is received in saline, labeled 'level 7 lymph node'. It  
consists of one black lymph node measuring 1.2 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm. The 
lymph node is bisected and submitted entirely in 6A.

COMMENTS: 
The patient's history of prior renal cell carcinoma is noted. There is, however, no material identified in our files for review and comparison . Accordingly , 
a limited series of immunohistochemical stains is perfonned on a representat ive block of a malignancy . Sections are examined along with appropriate ly 
staining positive and negative controls, with the following results: 
CK7 -Positive. 
CK20 -Negative. 
TTF1-Positive. 
RCC-Negative. 
Histologically, the malignancy does not resemble a typical renal cell carcinoma , and the staining pattern above essentially excludes the possibility of a 
metastasis from the kidney, and is typical of a primary pulmonary adenocarcinoma. 
The malignanc y grossly approaches the stapled parenchyma l surgical margin to within less than 0.1 em. Following removal of the staple line, the inked 
margin in this site is involved by malignancy . It is noted, however, that the nature of the stapling procedure itself precludes sampling of the true final 
surgical margin. Clinical correlation is suggested .  CLINICAL HISTORY:

GROSS DESCRIPTION: 
The specimen is received in two formalin-filled containers labeled with the patient's name. 
A. Container A is additionally labeled ""right upper lobe,"" and contains a 16.0 x 8.5 x 2.8 em, lung lobe. The pleura is purple-pink , moderately anthracotic 
and glistening . A 10.0 x 3.5 em, area of exposed red-pink mucosa is present. Within this area are multiple exposed segments of bronchi and 
vasculature. Extending from both ends of this area are two serpiginous staple lines, each measuring 5.5 an in greatest dimension. The staple line is 
removed and the underlying parenchyma is inked black. Additionally, the exposed bronchi and vascular margins are taken en face, and the exposed 
parenchyma is also inked black.. The bronchi feature yellow-tan , striated endothelium with no discrete lesions. Sectioning reveals a 2.5 x 1.5 x 1.5 em, 
well circumscribed , yellow-tan, firm glistening mass that resides 0.4 em below the blue-inked pleura, and approaches to within less than 0.1 cm of the 
closest stapled parenchymal margin. The remainder of the cut surface is pink-tan and focally congested. No additional lesions are identified. Seven iU­
defined black anthracotic nodules are identified consistent with p;tr~hrnnrhi::tl l\fIT\ph nodes. They range from 0.1 up to 0.3 em in greatest dimension . 
Representative sections are submitted in cassettes A 1-8, labeled designated as follows: 1 -bronchial and vascular margins, en face; 2-3 -

PATHOLOGY
PART #1: RIGHT UPPER LOBE
Resident Pathologist:
The specimen is received fresh labeled and designated
right upper lobe. It consists of one grossly identifiable fragment
of fleshy hemorrhagic tissue consistent with lung. A long black
suture which does not designate anything in particular is attached to
the specimen. The specimen weighs 66 grams and measures 10 x 6.5 x 4
cm.A palpable massis identified in the parenchyma. The overlying
pleura is inked with black ink. Serially sectioning the lung reveals
a 2.5 cm tumor massthat is white tan and firm around the edges and
slightly necrotic and hemorrhagic in the center. Tumor and normal
lung are collected for the tumor bank and for lab for
further studies. A tied off vessel is grossly identified. This
vessel is sampled and assumed to be a vascular margin. A long
parenchymal staple margin is grossly identified in the specimen in the
shape of a Y. This margin measures 9 cm at its longest aspect and
there is also an arm of the staple margin that measures 4.2 cm. The
tumormass appears to grossly abut the pleura. However, the tumor
massis located approximately 1.6 cm from the closest staple margin.
This staple margin is shaved and submitted in its entirety. The shave
suture margin is submitted in cassettes B-D.Sections are taken of
the tumor mass.Sectioning through the remainder of the lung
parenchyma does not reveal any other mass lesions. Sections of normal
lung are submitted. Additionally received with the specimen is a small
fragment of rib. This rib measures 2.1 x 1.4 x 0.3 cm. Adherent
fibrous tissue is identified on the outer aspect of the rib. Focal
areasof blood clot are also identified on the outer surface of the
rib.No gross abnormalities are identified. No sections are
submitted. The rib is a gross diagnosis only.

Macroscopy 
1.) Left lung: In filled, fixed condition, left lung of 16 x 11 em in size at base and up to 28 em high, central bronchial 
resection line 3 em proximal to the branch of the upper lobular bronchus. On the hilum, six blackish and partially 
damaged nodes of between 0.4 and 2.2 em in size. The dorsal portion of the gap between the lobes has been largely 
obliterated. In this region, covering an area of approx. 9 em, pleura unclearly delimited and discolored whitish, 
thickened, with flat retraction. Below this, with its main mass located in the border regions of segments 6 and 8-10, a 
moderately solid, pale brownish tumor with unclear demarcation and max. 7.8 em in size. Eccentrically, a malacic area of 
approx. 3.5 em in size. No demonstrable connection to bronchial branches that can be dissected out. Tumor extends as 
far as the pleura in the region of the retraction and approx. 1.5 em deep into the upper lobe in the region of 54. 
Parenchyma indurated peripheral to the tumor and yellow-brownish in color. Color of the rest of the lung tissue normal. 
2.) Left hilar LN (station 10): Gray-blackish node of 2 em in size. 
3.) Left pulmonary ligament LN (station 9): Damaged, gray-blackish node of 1.5 em in size. 
4.) Left paraesophageal LN (station 8): Gray-blackish node of 5 em in size with some surrounding tissue. 
5.) Subcarinal LN (station 7): Gray-blackish node of 9 mm in size. 
6.) Paraaortic LN (station 6): Damaged, gray-blackish node of 8 mm in size. 
7.) Subaortic LN (aortopulmonary window) (station 5): Gray-blackish node of 8 mm in size with some surrounding tissue.

Investigated: 
1.) Tumor with lung parenchyma in margin, tumor with pleura, tumor with gap between lobes (upper lobe stained), 
central bronchial resection line, vascular resection margins (11arger one split in half+ separate in lungs), 
2.)-9.) in each case, entire material (split in half for 8.), 
14 blocks, in some cases , PAS, diastaseRPAS. 
 Microscopy 
on 1.) Tumor structure composed of variably sized, partially branched, solid, focal atypical epidermoid epithelia, also 
focally arranged in trabecular groups. Moderately eosinophilic cytoplasm of intermediate width to wide, partially 
extended lengthways to spindly. Focal intercellular bridges. Nuclei round to oval, up to strongly anisomorphic, with 
coarse chromatin, mainly small to moderately large nucleoli and relatively numerous mitoses. Extensive necroses. 
Desmoplastic tumor stroma and groups of the atypical epithelia infiltrated with mixed inflammatory cells or 
predominantly with granulocytes. Expansion of the atypical epithelia across the fibrosed obliterated interlobular gap 
into the neighboring segments of the upper lobe. Dissected visceral pleura also focally infiltrated and notably strongly 
fibrously expanded here, as well as with superficial fibrin precipitates that are both external and incorporated. Sections 
of the tumor margins with up to high densities of intraalveolar granulocytes and macrophages, alveolar septa sometimes 
with strong edematous-fibrous expansion and infiltrated with mixed inflammatory cells, as well as surrounded by 
proliferated pneumocytes. Resection margin of bronchus and vessels as well as hilar lymph nodes free of tumors. The 
latter with normal lymphate. Cells with development of numerous activated follicles, minor to moderate deposits of 
fine-grained blackish pigments and fewer anisotropic particles within macrophages, as well as partially with nodular, 
fibrous zones with few spindle cells and, in sections, old necrotic zones, sometimes with the inclusion of planar calcium 
salt precipitates and focally minimal bony tissue. 
on 2.)-S.), 7.), + 9.) Lymph nodes as described under 1.). 
on 6.) Incompletely filled peripheral lung tissue with, at the level of the visceral pleura, small, sometimes squashed 
lymph nodes with normal lymphatic cells and more extended aggregates of macrophages with minor deposits of 
blackish, grainy pigment. 
on 8.) Peripheral lung tissue with subpleurally expanded alveolar spaces and rarefied and enlarged alveolar septa. 
Mainly pleural, up to moderate deposits of blackish, grainy pigment within macrophages. 
EVALUATION 
Primary diagnosis/diagnoses: Large, peripheral, bronchopulmonary, partially necrotically altered, with poor 
differentiation histologically, nonkeratinizing squamous epithelial carcinoma (G3) of the left lower lobe of the lung, 
located in the border region of segments 6 and 8 to 10. 
TNM classification pT2 pNO RO, Stage lB. 
C 34.3 M 8070/3 
Secondary diagnosis/diagnoses: Active chronic pneumonia in the areas around the tumor and fibrinous inflammation of 
the visceral pleura with markedly fibrous expansion over the tumor. Lymph nodes in this region (samples 1.)-7.) and 
9.)) with abnormal reactive changes, anthracotic pigment deposits and sometimes partially calcified, old necrotic or 
ossified nodular sclerosed zones. Mild focal emphysema of the lung (sample 8.)). 
Remark/addendum: The carcinoma has expanded across the lobular gap into the neighboring sections of segment 4 of 
the upper lobe. The resection margin of the bronchus and vessels as well as all lymph nodes that were removed or those 
that were identified are tumor-free. "," Site: The site of the tumor is the left lower lobe of the lung, specifically in the border region of segments 6 and 8 to 10.

Laterality: The laterality of the tumor is on the left side of the body.

Histology: The histology of the tumor is a large, peripheral, bronchopulmonary, partially necrotically altered, with poor differentiation, nonkeratinizing squamous epithelial carcinoma (G3).

Stage: The stage of the tumor is T2 pNO RO, Stage IB.

Grade: The grade of the tumor is G3, which indicates high-grade malignancy.

Behavior: The behavior of this tumor is malignant, as it shows features of invasive carcinoma and has spread across the lobular gap into the neighboring sections of segment 4 of the upper lobe.

REPORT ON FINDINGS 
Macroscopy 
1.) Inflated, fixed right lung measuring 12 x 11 em at the base and np to 25 em in length, central bronchus 
resection plane located 1.2 em proximal to the bifurcation of the upper lobe bronchus. Upper pleural fissure 
extensively obliterated in dorsal third, over segment 6 and adjacent sections of S2 an 8.5 x 6 em area of parietal 
pleura is extensively adhesive. At the hilus are six partly lesioned mobile grayish-black nodes between 1.1 and 
2 em in size, lower lobe bronchus and proximal sections oflower lobe segmental bronchi largely obstructed by 
a central moderately solid, pale brownish, predominantly endobronchial tumor, max. 4.8 em in size, in the lower 
lobe. Involvement of several grayish-black pigmented nodes up to 1.4 em in size by the tumor. Central blood 
vessels partly narrowed by the tumor. Tumor spread across the pleural fissure questionably into the upper lobe. 
Sleeve-like spread along the lower lobe bronchus, with apparent involvement of a 2.2 em grayish-black node 
extending right up to the hilar resection surface. Intermediate and peripheral lower lobe bronchial branches are 
markedly dilated and filled with thick mucus. Parenchyma in segment 6 below the pleural adhesion is an 
indurated and pale brownish-yellow area of about 3.5 em with unclear demarcation, medial parenchyma in 
segment 3 and apical parenchyma in segment I rarefied with lacunae or lacuna systems of up to 0.5 em. Pleura 
over segment I shows whitish discoloration in several, partly striated areas of up to 5 em, underlying 
parenchyma here shows an indurated and grayish-white seam about 0.3 em thick. 
2.) Hilar LN (station 10) right: 2.6 em lesioned node or node part, section surfaces predominantly pale brown to 
whitish suggestive of a tumor. 
3.) Pulmonary ligament LN (station 9) right: two lesioned grayish-black nodes with some surrounding tissue, 
0.3 and 1.2 em in size. 
4.) Paraesophageal LN (station 8) right: five lesioned grayish-black nodes or node parts between 0.3 and 1.2 
em. 
5.) Snbcarinal LN (station 7): 2 em node part with pale brown to whitish section surfaces suggestive of a tumor. 
6.) Low paratracheal LN (station 4) right: 3.5 em lesioned node with predominantly pale brown to whitish 
section surfaces suggestive of a tumor. 
7.) Retrotracheal right: 1 em lesioned grayish-black node with some snrronnding tissne. 
8.) High paratracheal LN (station 2) right: five lesioned grayish-brown nodes or node parts between 0.1 and I 
em. 
9.) Hilar LN (station (St.! 0) left: 2.5 em lesioned node or node part, section surfaces pale brown to whitish 
suggestive of a tumor. 
10.) Low paratracheal LN (station 4) left: 1.5 em five lesioned grayish-brown node with some surrounding 
tissue. 
II.) High paratracheal LN (station 2) left: 1.1 em lesioned grayish-brown node with some sun·ounding tissue, 
section surfaces pale brown to whitish . 
 Examined: 
1.) Tumor with rest of parenchyma+ proximal branch ofBJO, 2 sections of tumor with lower lobe bronchus+ 
involved nodes, 2 sections with pleural fissure to upper lobe (upper lobe portion partly color-marked), 2 
sections main bronchus at birfurcation of lower lobe bronchus with node close to hilus (hilar resection surface 
color-marked), SIO intermediate, S6 at junction of S2, Sl apical, S3 medial, S2 dorsal, central bronchus 
resection plane+ resection margins of vessels, hilar nodes,

Description of histological and cytological findings omitted for capacity reasons. 
EVALUATION 
Primary diagnosis/diagnoses: 
Central bronchopulmonary, histologically poorly to moderately differentiated, partly keratinizing squamous cell 
carcinoma of the lower lobe of the right lung with marked lymphogenic metastasization. 1NM classification 
according to this picture pT2 pN3 VI RO, stage lllB. C 34.3; M 8070/3. G3. 
Secondary diagnosis/diagnoses: 
Largely organized pneumonic infiltrate with fibrous parenchymal remodeling in S6 and old thromboses of 
adjacent small pulmonary arteries. Flat subpleural parenchymal scar in apical Sl with slight perifocal 
emphysema. Circumscribed high-grade emphysematous stromal remodeling with formation of small cysts in 
segments I and 3. Minimal mixed dust deposits in lung parenchyma and accumulation of alveolar siderophages 
with possible respiratory bronchiolitis. Pleural fibrosis especially over the fibrous remodeling area in S6 with 
adhesion. Tumor-free lymph nodes with slight to moderate pigment deposits and in some cases reactive 
follicular hyperplasia. 
Remark/addendum: 
On the one hand, the carcinoma is spreading to central segmental bronchi of the lower lobe by completely 
infiltrating and obliterating these, while growing into the lower lobe bronchus. On the other hand, the tumor 
extends to the pleura fissure. The angioinvasion does not affect small arteries and veins in the tumor area. Most 
of the 30 lymph nodes found are infiltrated with metastases, and they are not only detected in the tumor area 
and the hilus region, while the lymph node metastasis the near the main bronchus extends to within 0.5 mm of 
the mediastinal resection surface, but they are also found in the lymph node areas registered under 2.), 5.), 6.) 
and 8.)-II.). "," Site: Right lower lobe of the lung
Justification: The primary diagnosis specifies the location of the tumor as the right lower lobe of the lung.

Laterality: Right
Justification: The primary diagnosis mentions the tumor's location in the right lung, and several lymph node stations are also specified as right-sided.

Histology: Poorly to moderately differentiated, partly keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma
Justification: The primary diagnosis describes the tumor as a central bronchopulmonary, histologically poorly to moderately differentiated, partly keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma.

Stage: IIIB (pT2 pN3 VI RO)
Justification: The primary diagnosis provides the TNM classification of the tumor, which includes pT2 (tumor size and invasion), pN3 (extensive lymph node metastasis), and RO (no residual tumor). This information allows for the determination of stage IIIB.

Grade: G3
Justification: The primary diagnosis mentions that the tumor is a grade G3 carcinoma, indicating high-grade malignancy.

Behavior: Malignant
Justification: The primary diagnosis describes the tumor as a squamous cell carcinoma with marked lymphogenic metastasis, which indicates aggressive behavior and poor prognosis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1. Site: Right lower lobe of the lung
The report mentions a right lower lobectomy and describes two masses in the superior and basal aspects of the right lower lobe.
2. Laterality: Right
As described above, all the findings pertain to the right side of the body.
3. Histology: Invasive moderately differentiated non-keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma
The report describes two masses in the right lower lobe that are characterized as invasive moderately differentiated non-keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma.
4. Stage: pT2NOMx (for each tumor) or pT4NOMx (if one tumor represents an invasion from another primary site)
The report notes that the two tumors may represent synchronic primaries and suggests staging them as pT2NOMx, or alternatively, if one tumor represents an invasion from another primary site, it would be staged as pT4NOMx.
5. Grade: Not provided
The report does not mention the grade of the tumors.
6. Behavior: Malignant
As a cancer diagnosis, the behavior is malignant and invasive.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

    PRE- OP DIAGNOSIS:  Lung cancer. 
 
GROSS DESCRIPTION 
             A.  Submitted fresh for tissue procurement labeled ""left 
             upper lobe"" is a lobe of lung tissue which has been 
    amputated at the level of its principle bronchus and blood vessels. 
    The bronchial profiles that are present consists of three bronchi, 
    each approximately 8 to 9 mm across. They are grossly unremarkable. 
    Some vascular stumps are present at the point of amputation as well. 
    There is some anthracotic tissue present which  may represent some 
    hilar lymph nodes.  The visceral pleural surface of the lobe is 
    intact although there is a small area of adhesion and thickening 
    overlying an obviously large intraparenchymal tumor mass.  The 
    remainder of the parenchyma is anthracotic without focal lesion. 
    The lung was serially sectioned and this reveals a very large tumor 
    mass present in the center of the lobe which has a extensively 
    necrotic center. The tumor mass measures maximally 6 cm. across. 
    There is a rim of granular brown black tumor tissue present which 
    appears to extend to the visceral pleural surface. The center of the 
    tumor is necrotic with a creamy yellowish red appearance.  Fresh 
    tissue from normal lung is submitted for procurement as per 
    request of  Sections through the remainder of the lung 
    show no othe esions. Sections after fixation. 
 
    BLOCK SUMMARY:  1 - Bronchial and vascular margins; 2 - possible

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION 
             Microscopic sections of the left upper lobe tumor reveals a 
             squamous cell carcinoma which has variable histology. 
    Portions of the tumor are moderately differentiated and show 
    evidence of keratinization and well- defined intracellular bridges. 
    Other parts of the tumor have a sarcomatoid appearance and focally 
    develop a biphasic appearance with moderately differentiated 
    squamous carcinoma and spindle cell elements intermingling in a 
    carcinosarcomatous- like pattern. The finding of the histology is 
    present in the following template. 
      
  
  
    Histologic type:  Squamous cell carcinoma. 
    Histologic grade:  Poorly differentiated. 
    Primary tumor (pT):  6 cm mass which does not involve the visceral 
    pleural surface (pT2). 
    Margins of resection:  Negative. 
    Direct extension of tumor:  Absent. 
    Venous (large vessel) invasion:  Negative. 
    Arterial (large vessel) invasion:  Negative. 
    Lymphatic (small vessel) invasion:  Negative. 
    Regional lymph nodes (pN):  Two peribronchial lymph nodes and the 
    level 5 lymph node (part B) are negative for metastatic carcinoma. 
                                (pN0) 
    Distant metastasis (pM):  Could not be assessed.  (pMX)

DIAGNOSIS 
    A.  Lung, left upper lobectomy: 
          Invasive, poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma with 
          focal sarcomatoid features. 
          The tumor does not involve the visceral pleural surface. 
          Bronchial and vascular margins of resection are free of 
          tumor. 
          Two bronchial lymph nodes negative for metastatic carcinoma 
          (0/2). 
 
    B.  Lymph node, level 5, resection: 
          Fibrofatty tissue and sclerotic lymph node tissue negative for 
    metastatic carcinoma.

Two specimen s received: 
1: RIGHT UPPER LOBE 
Macroscopy: 
The specimen is labelled ""right upper lobe"" and consists of a lobe of lung measuring approximately 
165 x 100 x 55 mm in the inflated state. There are two staple lines present on the medial aspect of the 
specimen . Both of these are excised and the resultant margins inked with black ink . The lateral pleural 
surface is puckered over an area measuring approximately 15 x 6 mm. On sectioning through the lung 
parenchyma there is a firm cream nodule present deep to this puckering which measures 45 mm in 
greatest dimension. This lesion appears to abut the overlying pleura and is 21 mm from the nearest 
parenchymal resection margin. No endobronchial component of the lesion is identified 
macroscopicall y. The adjacent lung parenchyma appears unremarkable. [RS taken through bronchial 
and vascular resection margins-l A; peribronchial lymph node-IB; tumour with overlying pleural 
surface IC-IE; parenchymal resection margin-IF; section through adjacent uninvolved lung-IG.] 
Microscopy : 
Sections show a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. The lesion is subpleural and the tumour 
invades into but not through the visceral pleura. There is no blood vessel invasion and no lymphatic 
permeation is seen. No perineural permeation is identified . The lesion is well clear of the bronchial 
and the surgical resection margin. A peribronchial lymph node metastasis of adenocarcinoma is seen. 
Abutting the carcinoma in block 1 F is a carcinoid tumourlet. The adjacent lung shows very mild 
centriacinar emphysema . The bronchial resection margin shows mild active chronic inflammation and 
squamous metaplasia. 
2: HILAR LYMPH NODE 
Macroscopy : 
The specimen is labelled ""hilar lymph node"" and consists of two pieces of dark tan tissue measuring in 
aggregate 16 x 8 x 3 mm. [BIT-2A.]

Comment: 
This patient has a history of a prior laryngeal T4 squamous cell carcinoma. We have reviewed the tumor in the lung and the tumor of the larynx, and the tumors appear similar, with the laryngeal 
tumor showing slightly less squamous differentiation. It is not 
possible to determine if the tumor in the lung represents metastatic disease or a new primary. Review of the clinical workstation reveals that the multidicsiplinary thoracic oncology 
conference favored a new primary lung cancer.

Gross Description: 
There is one container labeled with the patient's name, ""   "" and 
additionally labeled ""right lower lobe, check bronchial margins"".   The specimen 
is received without fixative and consists of a lower lobe of right lung, 
measuring 16.4 x 10.7 x 4.6 cm. and weighing 230.0 gm.   The pleura shows marked 
anthracosis.   There is a palpable mass at approximately mid portion of the lobe, 
with umbilication of the overlying pleura on the lateral surface of the lobe. 
This umbilicated region is inked black.   The bronchovascular stumps are 
identified in the hilar aspect.   They are opened distally to reveal no 
intraluminal lesions.   Serial sections show that the mass is 5.0 cm. from the 
apex of the lobe and measures 4.9 x 3.7 x 3.5 cm.   It is irregularly shaped and 
has a tan-gray soft cut surface with necrosis and anthracotic pigment 
deposition.   There is no gross invasion of associated bronchovascular 
structures.   Five peribronchial lymph nodes are identified, measuring from 0.7 
cm. up to 1.1 cm. All lymph nodes show severe anthracosis.   The bronchial margin 
is shaved and submitted for frozen section.   Portions of the mass and normal 
lung parenchyma are also submitted for tissue banking.   Representative sections 
are submitted as follows: cassette ""1"" bronchial margin, for frozen section; 
cassette ""2"" vascular margins; cassettes ""3"" to ""5"" mass; cassette ""6"" random

HISTORY 
Adenocarcinoma. 
MACROSCOPIC 
Two specimens submitted. 
1: The first specimen is labelled 'left upper lobe' and consists of a lobe of lung 
measuring 200 x 80 x 20 mm in the fresh state. Overlying the apex and the lateral 
aspect of the apex of the lobe is an area of pleural tethering with an underlying tumour 
mass. The remainder of the pleural surface shows no specific abnonnality apart from 
extensive carbon pigmentation. The lobar bronchus has been transected t1ush with the 
hilar soft tissue and has two lumens at this point. Small peribronchial anthracotic 
nodes are noted, none of which appears macroscopically to be involved by a tumour. 
Sectioning reveals an apical tumour mass which appears to be bilobed. The combined 
maximum size of this lesion is 32 mm. The more superior lobule is approximately 20 
mm in diameter and shows foci of central necrosis. The more lateral and inferior 
lesion is approximately 12 mm in diameter and has a solid cream to tan cut surface. 
In some areas the lobules appear to be separated by 2 to 3 mm of unremarkable lung 
parenchyma. Both lobules abut the overlying pleura. No other lesions are identified 
on serial slicing through the parenchyma. However there is severe emphysema. [1 A, 
bronchial resection margin; 1 B, peribronchial lymph nodes; 1 C-I D longitudinal 
sections through tumour including overlying pleura and both lobules; IE, sections of 
inferolateral solid nodule with overlying pleura; 1 F, uninvolved lung parenchyma.] 
2: The second specimen is labelled 'left hilar lymph node' and consists of three 
ts of focally anthracotic and fatty tissue. [BIT,2A.] 
MICROSCOPY 
1: Sections show two adenocarcinomas. The first has a predominantly acinar architecture with a small 
amount of surrounding bronchioloalveolar type growth. Ext~nsive blo.od vessel invasion is noted and 
there is possible lymphatic penneatioll : The other lesion is a papillary adenocarcinoma. The lesions 
are separated by approximately 5 inm by unremarkable lung. A third focus of adenocarcinoma with a 
bronchioloalveolar pattern is present within the random section oflung. This measures 5 mm in 
diameter. Overlying both tumours, there is scarring of the pleura and features suspicious for invasion. 
Special stains will be performed. No perineural permeation is identified. The lesion is well clear of the 
bronchial resection margin. No lymph node metastases are seen. The uninvolved lung shows evidence 
of emphysema. 
2: Sections of the lymph nodes show reactive changes only. There is no evidence of malignancy. 
SUMMARY 
1-2: Left upper lobe and left hilar lymph nodes: 
A: Three foci of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma; 20 mm (acinar), 12 mm (papillary) and 5 
mm (bronchioloalveolar) in maximal dimension. 
B: Extensive blood vessel invasion; probable lymphatic permeation but no perineural permeation 
present. 
C: Possible pleural invasion identified; special stains being performed; clear of bronchial margin. 
D: No lymph node metastases. 
E: TINO (awaiting pleural stains) 
F: Non-neop lastic lung: Mild emphysema.  SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT 
1: Tumour invades into the visceral pleura overlying the tumour 'with the acinar architecture . It is not 
definitely on the pleural surface. There is no invasion of the visceral pleura by the papillary carcinoma. 
Both tumours stain positively for CK 7 and TTF 1. CK 20 is negative. This in.dicates both lesions are 
pulmonary in origin but considering their different architecture as they appear to represent synchronous 
tumours. 
SUMMARY 
1-2: Left upper lobe and left hilar lymph nodes: 
A: Three foci of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma; 20 mm (acinar), 12 mm (papillary) and 5 
mm (bronchioloalveolar) in maximal dimension. 
B: Extensive blood vessel invasion; probable lymphatic permeation but no perineural permeation 
present. 
C: Visceral pleural invasion identified overlying the acinar pattern carcinoma; clear of bronchial 
margin. 
D: No lymph node metastases. 
E: T2 NO (acinar pattern carcinoma) TINO (papillary and bronchioloalveolar pattern carcinomas) 
F: Non-neoplastic lung: Mild emphysen:a.

Macroscopy: 
Specimen consists of a left upper lobectomy measuring 205 x 135 x 
approximately 60 mm and weighing 503 g in the fixed state. Situated within 
the upper part of the lobe there is a large mass present medially. The pleural 
surface overlying this mass appears intact. On sectioning through the lobe this 
mass measures approximately 72 mm in maximum dimension. It has a 
lobulated cream appearance on cut surface and comes to within 1 mm of the 
pleural surface. Tumour is present surrounding the segmental bronchus but 
does not appear to have eroded through ~he bronchial wall. The endobronchial 
resection margin is clear of tumour. On section ing through the remainder of 
the lung parenchyma there is anthracosis but no evidence of emphysema and 
no further lesions are identified. There is a small focus of cyst or bullous 
formation present at the apex. [RS tak<;:n through hilar lymph nodes, A and B;

Container labeled --.. -right lower lobe of lung"" is a 
206 gram portion ~ monary parench yma grossly 
consistent with right lower lobe of lung. The specimen as received 
is 16.1 x 10.5 x 5.0 cm. The margin of resection is a previously 
sectioned bronchi with multiple staple lines. The pleura is 
wrinkled tan gray to brown and anthracotic streaked with a few 
nodular gray tan plaques up to 0.1 cm. Noted in the apparent 
lateral aspect in the central portion of the specimen there is a 
previously sectioned area of indurated umbilication measuring on 
reconstruction approximately 2.4 x 2.0 x 1.8 cm. This has been 
previously sectioned to reveal a lobulated gray tan to brown nodular 
lesion which grossly appears to extend to but not through the pleura 
in this area. This appears at its nearest point approximately 3.6 cm 
from the nearest bronchial margin. The remaining parenchyma is 
slightly diffusely consolidated mottled gray tan to pink with 
anthracotic streaking and focal areas of gross emphysematous change.

Comments 
This is staged as a pT1 b lesion based on the size of 2.4 cm in 
greatest diameter . The final stage should be performed in 
conjunction with the clinical information . 
Sections of the tumor show a poorly differentiated large cell 
carcinoma . A panel of immunohistochemical stains is performed 
including CK5/6, p63, TTF1 and CK7 (with appropriate positive and 
negative controls ). The neoplastic cells are positive for TTF1 and 
CK7. The neoplastic celis are negative for CK5/6 and p63. The 
overall histolog ic appearance in conjunction with the 
immunohistochemical stains is consistent with a poorly 
differentiated adenocarcinoma . In addition, some dense eosinoph ilic 
collagenous scar tissue is present suggesting this may have 
represented a so-called scar carcinoma . The carcinoma extends up to 
but not into the visceral pleura, being separated from the pleural 
margin by less than 1 mm. Clinical correlation and follow up is 
recommended . 
At the request of the undersigned pathologist , these slides have

 ADDENDUM #2 : 
  EGFR Mutation Analysis 
  
 
 
Referring Physician:  
 Body Site: Left upper lobe of lung  Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma  
 RESULTS: No mutation detected.  
 INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified in the sample pr ovided 
for analysis. Fewer than 5% of non- small cell lung carcinoma  
patients without identifiable mutations are reported to be  
responsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies.   COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more tumor cellularity is optimal  
for this mutation analysis. The sample submitted showed 80% tumor 
cellularity upon pathologist review.  A frequently occurring sequence change 2361G>A (Q787Q) was identified. This polymorphism is known not to have clinical significance.  
 Mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with  
differential responsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapies. The objective response rate among patients with a sensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%.  This assay analyzes exons 18 -21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain; 
based on the current literature, most mutations in non- small- cell 
lung carcinoma (NSCLC) are expected to occur in these exons.  
Mutations present in less than 10-20% of extracted DNA may not be detected by this method. Mutation status in a sample may change during tumor progression or the course of therapy; therefore, this result cannot be used to infer the presence or absence of a mutation in another sample or sub-sample obtained from this tumor.  This test is validated for non- small cell lung carcinoma. The  
clinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types  
is unknown.  METHOD:  
Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tu mor is  
 selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified  
and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to 
exons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by bi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary elec trophoresis 
and fluorescence detection. False positive or negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

particular test is not considered a stand alone test and should be used only in the context of other diagnostic tes ts or clinical

KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS  
 
 
Referring Physician:  
Body Site: Left upper lobe of lung Specimen Type: Slides  
Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma  RESULTS: Wild -type gene.  
 INTERPRETATION:  
No mutations were identified at codons 12 and 13 of the KRAS gene.  COMMENT:  
Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to be associated with poor prognosis, and resistance to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies in patients with non -small- cell lung cancer (NSCLC). KRAS  
mutations occur in 15-30% of NSCLC patients and are strongly associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking history.  This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene; based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is vali dated for 
use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and codon 13 mutations in fresh, frozen, or formalin -fixed paraffin embedded tissue. In particular 
the test performance has been established in samples of colorectal  
cancer and non- small cell lung carcinoma which harbor these 
mutations, although several other tissues are also known to harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix, etc.).  
 Analysis of EGFR mutation or gene amplification status may provide additional information regarding this patient's probability of response to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies, if clinically indicated. See references.  
  METHOD/LIMITATIONS:  
Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is  
selected for analysis. DNA is isolat ed from the sample, quantified 
and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single 
 nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13; 
primer extension products ar e analyzed using capillary gel  
electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

Fluorescence In -Situ Hybridization (FISH)  
 
Body Site: Left upper lobe of Lung 
Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma  
  INTERPRETATION:  
Negative for a rearrangement involving the ALK gene.  Probe #Nuclei Examined % Positive Nuclei % Control values 2p23(ALK)V 100 0 <15.0 A total of 100 cells were scored.  
 FINDINGS: FISH was performed on paraffin embedded tissue sections using dual color break- apart probe to the ALK 
gene at 2p23. This probe flanks the entire gene. If a rearrangement involving ALK is present, inversion or translocation, one of the two probe signals separates as one red (orange) and one green signal. In  
this specimen, separated signals were present in 0.5% of the nuclei scored. Based on laboratory validation data, these results are within the normal limits.  
 COMMENTS: Three to four copies of ALK were observed in 27.0% of cells. This gain of intact ALK fusion hybridization signals  
represents an aneuploid population with extra copies of chromosomes 2/2p ALK region. Additional copies of ALK are not uncommon in NSCLCs, although the significance of extra copies of the ALK gene in lung carcinoma is unclear at this time (

xtensive, central to peripheral bronchopulmonary adenocarcinoma of histologically mixed 
differentiation (G3), comprising partly maturing tubuloglandular cells and partly medium to 
large cells and also clear cells, with part ial necrotic alteration, invasion of the large pulmonary 
vessels and the pleura. Tumor classification according to these findings pT2 pN1 V2 RX, stage IIB. C34.2; M 8255/3.   
Comment/supplementary remark:   
The tumor invasion of the large pulmonary vessels with formation of lumen -obstructing 
thrombi of polypoid growth extending beyond the resection margin is very unusual.. The wall 
adhesion of the carcinoma is minimally about 0.5 mm from the resection margin of the vessels. The RX situation is likely explain ed by the fact that the tumor plug causing 
intraluminal obstruction of the middle lobe also adheres to the wall at a site on the resection margin. In addition, the tumor invasion in the pleura extends focally as far as the surface of the pleura. The glandular maturation component is partly reminiscent of the fetal type of bronchopulmonary adenocarcinoma. The smoldering or recurrent pneumonia is likely to have been of retrostenotic origin. The lymph node with tumor is located in the hilus region immediately next to one of the tumor- infiltrated large pulmonary vessels

"," The text appears to be a series of commands or function calls related to a medical report, possibly for a tumor or cancer case. Here are the categories and my justification for each:

1. Site - This is the location in the body where the tumor originated. It's crucial for determining the type of cancer and the appropriate treatment.
2. Laterality - This refers to the side of the body affected by the tumor, which can be important in certain types of cancer such as breast or lung cancer.
3. Histology - This is the type of tissue where the tumor originated, such as epithelial, mesenchymal, or lymphoid tissue. It helps determine the type of cancer and the appropriate treatment.
4. Stage - This is a measure of how far the cancer has spread in the body, which determines the prognosis and treatment options.
5. Grade - This is a measure of how aggressive the cancer cells look under the microscope, which can help predict the behavior of the tumor.
6. Behavior - This refers to whether the tumor is benign or malignant, which has implications for treatment and prognosis.

Justification: These categories are commonly used in medical reports for tumors and cancer cases, and they provide essential information for determining the type of cancer, the appropriate treatment, and the prognosis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GROSS DESCRIPTION-
A.Received fresh is a 10.5 x 5.5:x 3,5 cm wedge resection of lung. A staple tine indicates the resection margin.
The pleural surface, smooth and pale tan-red, shows minimal anthracotic stippling. Located approximately 2 cm
from the staple line is a 1.0x 0.8 cm area of pleural puckering. Beneath the pleura is an ill-circumscribed mass
measuring approximately 2.. 0 x 1.8 x 1.2 cm. The periphery of the mass is. firm and gray, and the center is
cavitated, No additional masses are identified throughout the remaining parenchyma. Intraoperative touch
preparations are prepared. A small portion of the mass, as well as normal lung, is obtained for the
T'iree.sections of the mass with overlying. pleura (inked black) are submitted in Al-A3.
INTRAOPERATIVE TOUCH PREP DIAGNOSIS: Non-small cell carcinoma.
B.Received fresh is a 106 gram, 17 x 8.0 x 5.4 cm lobe of lung. The pleura exhibits minimal to moderate
anthracotic.stippling. Towards the center of the resection is a 9.0 x 5.5 cm defect in the pleura; representing the
prior wedge resection. The edges of the pleural defect are 1.5 cm or greater from the staple: liner Sections of the
lung reveal a spongy tan-red parenchyma with no additional masses. Near the bronchial margin (which. is 2.5 cm
or greater from the staple line) are several small anthracotic Lymph nodes: The bronchial margin is submitted for
frozen section in B1, representative sections of lung parenchyma in B2 and $3, and lymph nodes. in B4.

FINAL SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT
Comment: There are two discrete tumors, both of which
have an in situ ""bronchioloalveolar"" component.
The larger tumor is poorly differentiated and the
smaller tumor is moderately differentiated. In the
absence of lymphatic invasion and lymph node
involvement ,these are considered to be
synchronous primaries and thus staged
according to the larger tumor.

Clinical diagnosis and question 
Non-small-cell bronchial carcinoma of left upper lobe (moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma). 
Asbestos exposure. 
REPORT ON FINDINGS 
Macroscopy 
1.) Left upper lobe: inflated, fixed left upper lobe measuring 22 x 13 x max. 4.5 em, central bronchus resection 
plane located 0.4 em proximal to the division into bronchi of the apical group and lingular bronchus. At the 
hilus four nodes, 0.5 and 1.8 em in size. A 3.3 em long staple suture line runs from the hilus in a cranial 
direction. A 7 em long staple suture line runs from the hilus in a caudodorsal direction demarcating the basis of 
an adhesive piece of lung tissue measuring 6 x I em to about 1.5 em thick (from S6?). Visceral pleura shows 
patchy blackish pigmentation, in the medial region a focal patchy reddish-brown discoloration and in the region 
of the hilus brown to reddish material. At the dorsal margin over S4 pleura shows an approximately 4 em area 
of star-shaped retracted tissue. Under this is a whitish, patchy and pale yellowish tumor, max. 4.8 em in size, 
with a partly unclear, partly vaguely arcuate configuration. Truncation of subsegmental branches of B4 and 5 in 
the tumor. Questionable infiltration in the attached wedge-shaped lung specimen, distance from its staple suture 
line 0.6 em. Other lung section surfaces show patchy blackish pigmentation. 
2.) Lobar LN (station 12) left upper lobe: 1.5 em node. 
3.) Interlobar LN (station 11) left: 1,5 em node. 
4.) Hilar LN (station 10) left: 3 em node. 
5.) Paraesophageal LN (station 8) left: 0.7 em lesioned node with surrounding tissue. 
6.) Paraaortic LN (station 6) left: two node parts with surrounding tissue, 1 em and 0.4 em. 
7.) Subaortic LN (aortopulmonary window) (station 5) left: 1.2 em node. 
8.) Low paratracheal LN (station 4) left: two node parts with surrounding tissue, 1.2 em and 0.5 em. 
9.) Low paratracheal LN (station 4) right: 1 em node or node part.

EVALUATION 
Primary diagnosis/diagnoses: 
Intermediate to peripheral, histologically poorly differentiated, large-cell, nonkeratinizing squamous cell 
carcinoma of the left upper pulmonary lobe mainly located in S4. TNM classification according to this picture 
pT2 pNO pMX Vl RO, stage IB. C34.1,M8070/3. 
Secondary diagnosis/diagnoses: 
Active chronic retention pneumonia at the tumor margin (sample 1.)). Lymph nodes with reactive lesions and 
anthracotic pigment deposits (samples 1.) to 9.)). Remark/addendum: 
The carcinoma has infiltrated the visceral pleura also in the region of the adhesion site with the co-resected 
piece from the lower lobe of the lung. The resection margin of the bronchus and vessels, the parenchyma of the 
co-resected piece from the lower lobe of the lung and all excised lymph nodes are tumor-free. 
No asbestos bodies are found in the prepared section planes. But very much further-reaching investigations, 
especially dust analyses, are needed to determine the asbestos exposure of the lung. "," 1. Site: Lung (left upper lobe). Justification: The report clearly specifies the tumor location as the left upper lobe of the lung.
2. Laterality: Left. Justification: This is consistent with the report's description of the tumor being in the left upper lobe.
3. Histology: Large-cell, nonkeratinizing squamous cell carcinoma. Justification: The report states this as the primary diagnosis.
4. Stage: T2 pNO pMX V1 RO, stage IB. Justification: The report provides the TNM classification as pT2 pNO pMX V1 RO, stage IB.
5. Grade: Not provided. Justification: The report does not specify a grade for the tumor.
6. Behavior: Malignant. Justification: This is inherent in the diagnosis of carcinoma; it is a malignant tumor by definition.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gross Description:
A. The specimen is labeled left upper lobe and is received without fixative, It consists of a lobe of lung
.measuring I x 9. 3 x 6.0 crn and weighing 170 grams. The pleural surface is violet to pale red with
numerous string adhesions along the anterior surface and toward the basilar portion. The lateral apical
portion of the lobe has a mottled yellow-tan to pink to reddish violet appearance with thickening of the
pleura over an area measuring `.5 x 5 cm, The bronchial margin is identified and is removed as a thin
shave for en face frozen section, On dissection there is an apical tumor mass which is composed of tan to
pale yellow to pale red tissue and overall measures 5.5 x 5.2 x 4 cm, This tumor is centrally cavitary
containing blood clot. This lesion is grossly 0.5 cm from the bronchial margin and abuts the pleural
surface in numerous areas. The inferior edge of the lung has a ratty irregular appearance, An intralobar
fissure is not appreciated grossly, This tumor mass is 2 cm from the closest inferior edge, The remaining
lung has a wet soggy consolidated appearance, Representative sections are submitted, Section surrimary:
Al) bronchial margin from frozen section, A2) vascular margins, A3) section of main bronchus with closest
approach of tumor, A4) tumor and pleural surface, A5-A7) sections of tumor, A8-A9) uninvolved lung,

A. Sections of the Iobectomy show an invasive squamous cell carcinoma predominantly forming
angulated and irregular nests with enlarged nuclei and occasional prominent nucleoli, There is Mild
keratin formation with intercellular bridges and punc;tate necrosis. The tumor is away from the bronchial
and vascular margin but does invade through the visceral pleura where there is dense fibrosis. Tumor is at
the inked outer margin, No diagnostic lymphovascular or perineural invasion is identified, The uninvolved
hung has minimal changes: The sounded focus at the bronchial margin on the frozen section slide is a
rounded aggregate of degenerate hyaline cartilage that has some squamoid features.
B Sections of the additional bronchial margin show benign bronchus and surrounding lung tissue
uninvolved by malignancy.
C, Sections of the pulmonary ligament N9L. specimen show a distorted fragment of lung tissue with a
nested well differentiated neoplastic process at one edge measuring 0.9 cm. The cells are uniformly small
with oval nuclei and even lightly speckled chromatin. No necrosis or mitotic activity is present. The lesion
is at the distorted edge of the tissue.. lmmunohistochemistry shows the lesion is positive for chromogranin
and synaptophysin. The tumor is negative for pancytokeratin.

Peripheral bronchopulmonary, histologically predominantly well differentiated mixed adenocarcinoma of the left lower lobe of the lung. TNM classification on the basis of this material pT2 pN0 R0, stage IB. C34.3 M8255/3.  
Comment/supplementary remark:   
The classification of the adenocarcinoma of the lung is based on the result of the 
immunohistochemical analysis obtained on the previous biopsy material. The tumor has a compact, low stromal structure, of predominantly tubulopapillary differentiation and shows a small bronchioloalveolar component at the margin. It extends to below the pleura, which it has not however infiltrated on the basis of the sample examined. In a central direction the carcinoma has invaded a peripheral b ronchus, this being markedly distended and largely 
obstructed by a tumor plug.  
"," 1. ""Site"": Lung. Justified as the report specifically mentions it's a peripheral bronchopulmonary tumor located in the left lower lobe.
2. ""Laterality"": Left. Justified as the tumor is located in the left lower lobe of the lung.
3. ""Histology"": Mixed adenocarcinoma. Justified as the report states the tumor is a well-differentiated mixed adenocarcinoma.
4. ""Stage"": T2 N0 M0, stage IB. Justified as the tumor has invaded the lung tissue and reached below the pleura, but has not infiltrated it, and no lymph node or distant metastasis is mentioned.
5. ""Grade"": Not provided. The report does not mention the grade of differentiation for this adenocarcinoma.

Gross Description:  
The specimen is received in six parts, all labeled with the patient's name. 
 
Part A is received fresh for frozen section diagnosis additionally labeled  
""mediastinal mass"" and consists of a 5.3 x 2.6 x 0.7 cm portion of yellow -tan 
fatty tissue.   Sectioning reveals a cystic like structure with a granular wall  
that is 3 x 2 x 1 cm and is does not contain any fluid.   The remaining portion  
of tissue has a yellow -tan lobulated smooth and glistening cut surface.  
Residual frozen tissue is  submitted in cassette A1.   Other representative  
sections are submitted in cassettes A2- 3.  
 Part B is received in a single formalin filled container additionally labeled  
""11R"" and consists of a 2.1 x 1.8 x 1.4 cm red- brown irregular portion of soft  
tissue .  The specimen is serially sectioned and submitted entirely in cassettes  
B1-2.  
 Part C is received fresh for collection by the Tissue Bank and.   It 
is additionally labeled ""right upper lobe"" and consists of a previously incised  
lung lobe that is 17 x 7 x  3.5 cm.   There is additionally, another portion of  
lung tissue in the same container that is 7 x 3 x 0.7 cm, which most likely came  
from the area previously incised on the larger portion.   There is an 8.3 x 3.5 x  
3.5 cm white- tan irregular, partially necr otic mass where the previous incision  
has been made. This lesion abuts the pleural surface in this area and is 2 cm  
from the nearest bronchial and vascular margin. The nearest lung parenchymal  
margin is 1.6 cm from the lesion.   Further sectioning of the mass reveals a  
white to yellow -tan, multiloculated, partially hemorrhagic and necrotic mass.  
The mass appears to be involving the pleura, but not penetrating completely  
through the pleura.    
 Representative sections are submitted as follows:  
     C1      br onchial and vascular margins;  
     C2 -3     mass to include overlying pleura;  
     C4 -5     mass to include adjacent lung parenchyma;  
     C6      uninvolved lung parenchyma.  
 Part D is received in a single formalin filled container additionally labeled  
""9R; inferior pulmonary ligament"" and consists of a 1.5 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm portion  
of lymph node with attached fibrous tissue.   The specimen is bisected and  
entirely submitted in cassette D1.  
 
 Part E is received in a single formalin filled container additionally labeled  
""7R"" and consists of multiple portions of irregular nodal tissue admixed with  
fibrous tissue, ranging from 1.5 to 0.4 cm in greatest dimension.   The specimen 
is submitted in toto in cassettes E1- 2.  
 
Part F is received in a single formalin filled container additionally labeled  
""4R"" and consists of two portions of fibrofatty soft tissue that are 4.0 x 1.3 x  
0.5 cm and 2.6 x 1.2 x 0.9 cm.   Multiple lymph nodes are identified, ranging  
from 0.3 to 1.0 cm.    
 Representative sections are submitted as  follows:  
     F1      multiple whole lymph nodes;  
     F2      one lymph node bisected;  
     F3      one lymph node bisected;

Tissue taken at lobectomy. 
MACROSCOPIC 
Two specimens received. 
1: The specimen is labelled ""right upper lobe"" and consists of a right upper lobectomy which measures 
140 x 120 x 50 mm in maximum dimension. Onpalpation there is a firm to hard mass located in the 
apical segment, predominantly on the postsromedial aspect. The mass measures approximately 60 x 65 
x 40 mm in maximum dimension. There is puckering of the overlying pieural surface at the apex. The 
pleural surface on the medial aspect of the specimen has a fibrinous-type exudate. On sectioning there 
is a solid lobulated tumour which has a yellow greyish-white cut surface. It, in places, has a villous­
like architecture. There is haemorrhage scattered throughout the tumour. The tumour appears to abut 
the pleural surface. The tumour appears to lie at least 20 mm from the bronchial resection margin. 
There is a soft tissue resection margin which has a row of staples and measures 85 mm in length. The 
tumour is well clear of this. The surrounding adjacent uninvolved lung parenchyma has a colhipsed 
appearance. [lA, bronchial resection margin; lB-F, tumour; 10, adjacent uninvolved lung 
parenchyma; 1H, hilar lymph nodes]. 
2: The specimen is labelled ""hilar lymph node"" and consists of four irregular greyish-black pieces of 
tissue which measure in aggregate 30 x 20 x 10 mm. [BIT, 2A]. 
MICROSCOPIC 
1: Sections show a well differentiated adenocarcinoma. The tumour has a prominent 
bronchioloalveolar component with a marked papillary pattern. The cells are tall and columnar with 
variable cytoplasm ranging from non-mucinous to clear to mucinous. The lesion is subpleural but 
definite pleural invasion is not identified. There is no blood vessel invasion and no lymphatic 
permeation is seen. No perineural permeation is identified. The lesion is well clear ofthe bronchial 
resection margin. Tumour appears to be present at a diathermied margin, possibly related to pleura in 
block IF. It is difficult to know whether this represents a true margin. No lymph node metastases are 
present. The adj acent lung shows evidence of emphysema . Within the random section of lung, there is 
a localised area of necrosis with surrounding fibrosis. Special stains for microorganisms will be 
performed. 
2: Sections of the lymph nodes show reactive changes only. There is no evidence of malignancy. 
SUMMARY 
Right upper lobe lung and hilar lymph nodes: 
1: Well differentiated adenocarcinoma; 65 mm in maximal dimension. 
2: No blood vessel, lymphatic or perineural invasion present. 
3: No pleural invasion identified; clear of bronchial margin but extends to an area of diathermy (see 
report). 
4: No lymph node metastases. 
5: T2NOMX 
6: Emphysema and necrotic lesion; special stains for microorganisms being performed.

A. The specimen is labeled left upper lobe lung wedge and is received without fixative. It consists of a 
wedge resection of lung which measures 5.2 x 2.5 x 1 cm. A metallic staple line is present along one 
edge. It weighs 9 grams. The pleural surface varies from dark reddish-violet to several foci which have an 
anthracotic appearance. There is a palpable subpleural mass centrally with very slight puckering of the 
pleural surface. On sectioning , this subpleural mass is tan and anthracotic and measures 2 x 1.7 x 1.5 cm. 
It is grossly 0.6 cm from the closest staple line. A representative section of this subpleural mass is 
submitted for frozen section as FS1. The tissue remaining from frozen section is submitted for permanent 
section in cassette A 1. The staple line from the lung wedge is dissected free and the resected edge is 
inked green. Additional representative sectio~he lung wedge, to include all the grossly recognizable 
neoplasm , are submitted in cassettes A2-A4._ 
B. The specimen is labeled left uppe -. ,.e _ - •• ts of a lobe of lung  FINAL SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT 
which weighs 189 grams. It measures 23.5 x 9 x up to 3 cm. The pleural surface of the lung varies from 
pale red to violet to tan in the basilar and most apical portion. There is anthracotic streaking which 
appears linear. Along the middle anterior surface of the lung, there is a 9 cm staple line. The pleural 
surface appears smooth throughout. At the hilum, the bronchial margin is removed as a thin shave and is 
submitted for frozen section as FS2. There is a prominent firm 1.1 cm peribronchial node which is also 
submitted for frozen section as FS3. There are two smaller 0.7-0.8 cm peribronchial nodes. The bronchi 
are dissected and there is no grossly obvious intrabronchial tumor. On sectioning, the metallic staple line 
is 4 cm from the bronchial resection margin. Sections of the pulmonary parenchyma along the staple line 
reveal no grossly obvious tumor. Close serial sectioning of the lung reveal the pulmonary parenchyma at 
the apical portion of the lung to have a honeycomb appearance . Sections of the remainder of the lung 
reveal spongy soft red pulmonary parenchyma without additional masses. Representative sections are 
submitted. Section summary : 81) bronchial margin remaining from frozen section, 82) peribronchial node

Histology: The histology report is not detailed, but based on the procedure described, it may include carcinoma and various benign findings such as anthracosis, fibrosis, and honeycombing.
Stage: Not provided (Staging requires assessment of tumor size, nodal involvement, and metastasis)
Grade: Not provided (Grading requires evaluation of tumor differentiation which is not described in the procedure)
Behavior: Not provided (Malignant behavior is expected in cases with carcinoma, but confirmation requires microscopic examination)

The description suggests that various specimens were removed from the lung and submitted for pathological examination. The findings include removal of a portion of the bronchus, dissection of pulmonary parenchyma along the staple line, and sampling of peribronchial lymph nodes. Some specimens show anthracotic discoloration, which is associated with exposure to coal dust or other environmental pollutants. The procedure also notes a honeycomb appearance in sections of the apical upper lobe, which may suggest interstitial lung disease. However, without microscopic examination and additional clinical information, it is difficult to provide more specific diagnostic information.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

REPORT ON FINDINGS 
Macroscopy 
1.) Inflated, fixed left lung measuring 17 x 14 em at the base and up to 28 em in length, central bronchus 
resection plane located 3 em proximal to the bifurcation of the upper lobe bronchus. At the hilus a 2.3 em 
mobile node with pale brownish-white section surfaces suggestive of a tumor. Pleural fissure obliterated in 
middle third, at the junction of segment 3 with segment the parietal pleura shows an extensive 4 7 x 5.5 em area 
of adhesion. Under this is a centrally soft, but otherwise soft to moderately solid tumor, max. 1.0 em in size, 
pale brownish white at the margin, with a relatively clear and somewhat arcuate demarcation, the main mass 
being in segments 3 and 2 and adjacent sections of the lingula, extending to the pleura in the region of the 
adhesion and involvement of some nodes up to 2.5cm in size, especially at central sites, extending here right up 
to the hilar resection surface. Narrowing of proximal upper lobe segmental bronchi by the tumor. Tumor spread 
to the pleural fissure, lower lobe shows no macroscopic infiltration. Parenchyma in the tumor environment and 
peripherally especially in segment 3 partly diffuse, partly patchy induration and of brownish-yellow color. Rest 
of parenchyma especially in the subpleural region shows slight rarefaction in parts, accentuation of apical 
lesions in segment 1, with lacunae or lacuna systems up to 0.5 em here. In the lower lobe at the branch into the 
bronchi of the basal group two grayish-black nodes up to 0.6 em. 
2.) Pleural tissue from repeat resection: flat or membranous tissue measuring 6.5 x 4 em and up to 0.2 em thick. 
Surface partly smooth, partly rough.

the larger on the section surfaces with 0.3 em hard yellowish area. 
9.) Prevascular and retrotracheal LN (station 3) upper lobe vein: 1.2 em node with some surrounding tissue. 
10.) Hilar LN (station 10) right: 2 em node. 
11.) Paraesophageal LN (station 8) right: two lesioned nodes, 1.6 and I em in size.

EVALUATION 
Primary diagnosis/diagnoses: 
Large, central to peripheral bronchopulmonary, histologically poorly differentiated, large-cell and 
polymorphocellular, nonkeratinizing squamous cell carcinoma of the upper lobe of the left lung. 1NM 
classification according to this picture pT2 pN2 Vl RO, stage MA. C 34.1; M 8070/3; 3. 
Secondary diagnosis/diagnoses: 
Tumor necrosis varying in extent with the formation of a lacuna. Chronic resorptive and organizing pneumonia 
in the tumor environment and S3 periphery. Emphysematous stromal remodeling of lung parenchyma with 
formation of small subpleural cysts in the apex. Suspected respiratory bronchiolitis. Pleural adhesion zones and 
chronic fibrosing parietal pleuritis (sample 2.)). Lymph nodes with reactive follicular hyperplasia in some cases 
(e.g. samples 6.), 8.) and 12.)), in some cases sinus enlargement and an overall rather minor anthracotic pigment 
deposit. 
Remark/addendum: 
The main tumor mass lies in segments 3 and 2. Since the central segmental bronchi are tumor-free, it appears to 
be a primarily peripheral carcinoma of the lung, which has invaded the pleura of the pleural fissure and the 
adhesion zone, although at the latter site the tumor manifestation appears confmed to the visceral layer. Most 
lymph node metastases, some of which are rather large, are found in the hilus region. A micro-metastasis is 
detected in sample. 8.), which explains the nodal classification pN2. "," 1. ""Site"": Left lung. Justified as the report clearly mentions the examination of the left lung and presence of a tumor in it.
2. ""Laterality"": Left. Justified as the report specifically states the location of the tumor in the left lung.
3. ""Histology"": Poorly differentiated, large-cell and polymorphocellular, nonkeratinizing squamous cell carcinoma. Justified as per the pathological diagnosis provided in the report.
4. ""Stage"": The stage is not explicitly provided, but based on the TNM classification given (pT2 pN2 Vl RO), it can be inferred that this is a more advanced stage cancer. However, without all necessary parameters (like M), a definitive stage cannot be determined. So, I would say ""not provided"".

KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS
Referring Physician:
Body Site :Right lower lobe of lung
Specimen Type: Slides
Clinical Data :Adenocarcinoma
RESULTS :Wild-type gene.
INTERPRETATION:
No mutations were identified at codons 12 and 13 of the KRAS gene.
COMMENT:
Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to be associated with poor
prognosis ,and resistance to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor
therapies in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). KRAS mutations occur in 15 -30% of non -small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
patients and are strongly associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking
history.
This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;
based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are
expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of
the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low
percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated for
use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and codon 13 mutations in fresh,
frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue. In particular
the test performance has been established in samples of colorectal
cancer and non-small cell lung carcinoma which harbor these
mutations, although several other tissues are also known to harbor
KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix,
etc.).
Analysis of EGFR mutation or gene amplification status may provide
additional information regarding this patient's probability of
response to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies, if
clinically indicated. See references.
METHOD/LIMITATIONS:
Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is
selected for analysis .DNA is isolated from the sample ,quantified
and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to
exon 2 of the KRAS gene .PCR products are subjected to single
nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;
primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel
electrophoresis and fluorescence detection .False positive or
negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants
or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

ADDENDUM 3:
EGFR Mutation Analysis
Body Site: Right lower lobe of Lung
Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma
RESULTS: Positive for the E746 A750de15 mutation in Exon 19.
INTERPRETATION: Deletion mutations in exon 19, mostly involving the
LREA motif ,are reported to correlate with responsiveness to EGFR
tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies in patients with non -small-cell
lung carcinoma.
COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more cellularity is optimal for
this mutation analysis .The sample submitted showed 50% tumor cellularity upon pathologist review.
E746A750del5 corresponds to 2235_2249de115.
A frequently occurring sequence change 2361 G>A (Q787Q) was
identified .This polymorphism is known not to have clinical
significance.
Mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with
differential responsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase
inhibitor (TKI) therapies. The objective response rate among
patients with a sensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%.
This assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain;
based on the current literature ,most mutations in non-small-cell
lung carcinoma (NSCLC) are expected to occur in these exons.
Mutations present in less than 10-20% of extracted DNA may not be
detected by this method .Mutation status in a sample may change
during tumor progression or the course of the therapy; therefore,
this result cannot be used to infer the presence or absence of a
mutation in another sample or sub -sample obtained from this tumor.
This test is validated for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The
clinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types
is unknown.
METHOD:
Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is
selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the samples, quantified
and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to
exons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by
bi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary gel
electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or
negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants
or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

MACROSCOPIC 
Two specimens submitted. 
I: The first specimen is labelled ""right lower lobectomy"" and consists of a right lower lobectomy 
specimen which measures 70 x 80 x 60 mm. Sectioning reveals a large tumour present predominantly 
in the superior aspect of the lobe which measures 7S x 60 x 60 mm. The tumour has a pink and tan 
colour and has a soft consistency. The tumour reaches the pleura but no definite invasion through the 
pleura is seen grossly. The tumour extensively invades around bronchi and at one point tumour is seen 
to erode through the bronchial wall to form a polypoid mass measuring up to 10 mm within the 
bronchial lumen. This is present approximately 14 mm away from the nearest bronchial resection 
margin. The tumour appears to come within approximately 2 mm of the hilar resection margin but 
tumour is not seen at a surgical resection margin. Located away from the main tumour within the 
inferomedial aspect of the lung are three separate tumour nodules measuring between S to 12 mm in 
diameter. An area of fibrosis and calcification measuring up to 3 mm in diameter is also seen within 
the region of one of the separate tumour nodules in the inferior aspect of the lobe. Lung tissue at the 
superio~ aspect of the lobe proximal to the tumour shows yellow discolouration. The lung in the 
inferior aspect of the lobe distal to the tumour appears fairly unremarkable. [I A, bronchial and hilar 
vascular resection margins; IB, vascular resection margin and lymph nodes; I C-l G, tumour with ID 
being mediastinal resection margin, I E bronchus with invasion by tumour; I G-lI, separate tumour 
deposits inferior to the main tumour; lJ, uninvolved lung proximal to tumour; lK, uninvolved lung 
distal to tumour.] 
2: The second specimen is labelled ""hilar lymph node"" and consists of multiple fragments of grey 
tissue measurin in aggregate approximately 20 x 20 x S mm. [BIT, 2A.] 
MICROSCOPY 
I: Sections show a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. Much of the tumour has the 
cytoarchitectural features of a non-mucinous bronchioloalveolar carcinoma, but unequivocal stromal 
invasion is present, and an endobronchial component is confirmed. Tumour abuts but does not invade 
the pleura, and the bronchial and mediastinal resection margins are clear of malignancy. No vascular 
or lymphatic invasion is identified. Peribronchial lymph nodes show no evidence of metastatic 
adenocarcinoma. Several satellite nodules are confirmed in lung parenchyma inferior to the main 
tumour mass. These show the BAC architecture and presumably represent spread through airways. 
2: Sections show fragments of lymph node in which there is no evidence of metastatic 
adenocarcinoll1 ~\'

Sections of the submitted ""Ungula "" (part E )show an Invasive ,poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma (3.2 cm) which has
an infiltrative and poorly circumscribed border, involving the visceral pleura (PI-2). The tumor invades into but not
through the visceral pleura (biockE7). All surgical resection margins are free of tumor .Of note, multiple Intra-arterial
invasions with tumor cells colonizing the endothelial wall are also seen .A provisional primary tumor staging is provided
as T2a based on the staging information from the 'tingula ""specimen.
Additional sections of the specimen ""pleural deposit"" (part A )show focal small basophilic nests of tumor cells with
some features of neuroendocrine differentiation .Small amount of mature adipose tissue is also present .At deeper
level, some of these areas also showed tubular and acinar architecture ..These tumor cells are positive for TTF-1 and
are negative for syneptophysin and chromogranln ,confirming their malignant nature.

16 x 11 x 3.7 cm.  There is a 5.5 cm staple line near the hilum.  Also 
in the hilar area there is a stapled bronchial stump which measures 6 
mm in diameter when removing staples.  A stapled vessel is also noted 
in the hilum measuring 7 mm in diameter.  These margins appear 
unremarkable.  The pleural surface is smooth and mostly pink and 
glistening with minimal anthracotic pigmentation.  In the superior 
  
anterior portion, however, there is marked puckering and retraction of 
the pleura.  This area is painted black.  On section it corresponds to 
a superficial, fleshy tan dull tumor mass measuring 3.5 x 2.1 x 2.5 cm. 
 A touch preparation is made and a sample is taken for Tissue 
Procurement.  Remaining pulmonary parenchyma is soft pink and spongy. 
Upon exploring the major vessels and bronchi, no lesions are found. 
Rep. sections are submitted following fixation 
Blood account: 1- bronchial and vascular margins esection ; 2 
through 5- tumor; 6 through 7- noninvolved lung.   
 
B.  The specimen is received unfixed labeled ""level II"". It consists of 
a single glistening soft reddish blac dule measuring 0.7 cm in 
greatest dimension.  It is bisected,  
 
C.  Received fresh labeled ""level VII"" is a 1.6 x 1.2 x 0.5 cm soft 
tan-red-gray tissue.  The specimen is quadrasected and entirely 
submitted in one block.

Material examined: 
Left lower lobe 
Clinical diagnosis and question 
Bronchial carcinoma of the left lower lobe. 
REPORT ON FINDINGS 
Macroscopy 
1.) Left lower lobe: inflated, fixed left lower lobe measuring 15 x 10 em at the base, up to 19.5 em high, central 
bronchus resection plane located at the level of bifurcation B6 and the bronchus of the lower group. A staple 
suture line runs from the hilus in a ventral direction for 2.5 em, and a staple snture line runs from the hilus in a 
cranial direction for 3.5 em. Visceral pleura over S6/S!O in the laterodorsal region shows an area of whitish 
thickening and flat protrusion and retraction measuring about 6.5 x 3.5 em. Under this is a fum tumor, max. 5 
em in size, with a vaguely arcuate configuration and central resorption. Peripheral branches ofB6, B9 and BlO 
leading into the tumor. Parenchyma in the tumor margin area partly compacted and pale. Inclusion of vascular 
branches in the tumor. Rest of parenchyma largely inconspicuous. 
2.) Lobar LN (station 12) lingula: 1 em node. 
3.) Lobar LN (station 12) lower lobe: two nodes, 1.2 em and 0.7 em. 
4.) Interlobar LN (station 11) left: 1.5 em node. 
5.) Hilar LN (station 10) left: four nodes between 0.6 em and 1.5 em, partly linked together. 
6.) Pulmonary ligament LN (station 9) left: three nodes between 0.4 em and 0.9 em. 
7 .) Low paratracheal LN (station 4) left: 1.7 em fatty tissue with three nodes between 0.5 em and 1 em. 
8.) Prevascular and retrotracheal LN (station 3) left: three nodes between 0.3 em and 1.2 em with surrounding 
tissue. 
9.) Subcarinal LN (station 7): 1.5 em node 
10.) Paraaortic LN (station 6): 2 em node with surrounding tissue 
11.) Subaortic LN (aortopuhnonary window) (station 5): 1 em node with surrounding tissue 
12.) Hilar LN (station 10) right: two lesioned nodes, 1.5 em and 1 em 
13.) Low paratracheal LN (station 4) right: 1.8 em node with some surrounding tissue. 
Examined: 
1.) a+b: Tumor with pleura and resorption lacuna, c: tumor with peripheral branch ofB9, d: S8 peripheral, e: 
bronchus and vessel resection margins (tangential), 
2.)-13.) All material (in 13.) lamellated) 
17 blocks, partly Elastica-van Gieson, PAS, diastase-PAS 
 Microscopy 
Re 1.): Tumor made up of complexes of destructive growth and longer, partly reticulate structures oflarge 
atypical epithelia in a multilayered arrangement, repeatedly showing vaguely squamous cell layers, with partly 
copious eosinophilic or clear, otherwise stained cytoplasm with inclusion of disorganized, anisomorphic nuclei 
of differing sizes, which also show an enlarged chromatin stmcture. Nucleoli always prominent. Intercellular 
gaps and bridges. Isolated small islands of large tumor cells layered rather like onion skins. Occasionally 
intracellular granular, diastase-digestible, PAS-positive particles and at the same time also small lacunae 
surrounded by tumor cells and containing diastase-resistant, PAS-positive material, with epithelia here at the 
margin also visible in parts as bronchioloalveolar in nature. Between the tumor cell structures smaller areas of 
necrosis with partly degraded granulocytes and other cell debris. Then a lacuna formation with abundant 
necrotic material, here and there remnants of delicate alveolar septa and vessels still visible. Also cholesterol 
crystal gaps and accumulation of various inflammatory cells. Isolated relatively small vessels in the tumor with 
tumor cell nests in the lumen. In parts there is a transfer of tumor cell structures to original respiratory 
epithelium. In the region of cholesterol crystal gaps is an accumulation of large, mostly foamy macrophages 
also within the very confined, nonoxygenated subpleural ( n?) that is still present. In 
some sections, the tumor also extends directly to the pleura, where the pleural elastic fascia is destroyed and 
transcended by a few tumor cell nests. Above this, the pleura is markedly enlarged in parts by connective tissue, 
and in the region of its surface is an accentuated accumulation of inflammatory cells, proliferation of 
mesenchymal spindle cells and capillary vessels and various inflammatory cells and fibrin plaque. Tumor 
growth in a central direction, partially surrounding larger vessels with infiltration and partial destruction of a 
bronchus. Further inflammatory cell infiltrates in the marginal adjacent parenchyma of the lung, where there are 
interstitial follicular lymphocyte aggregates. Small intraalveolar groups of brown pigmented macrophages. 
Otherwise essentially preserved alveolar stroma. Only circumscribed lymphocyte-rich infiltrates in the region of 
the peripheral airways and respiratory bronchioles and alveolar duct. No evidence of tumor at the 'resection 
margins of bronchus and large pulmonary vessels. The stroma of the bronchus shows an increase in elastic 
connective tissue fibers, as well as some chronic inflammatory cells, in part follicularly compressed aud also 
manifest in the region of bronchial glands. A few of them are atrophied. In between or alongside are islets of 
fatty tissue. 
Re 2.) -13.) Some lymph nodes-in particular the larger ones-show an increase in secondary follicles with 
inclusion of large and partly active germinal centers. Small patches of anthracotic pigment deposits, 
accumulation oflarge-cell macrophages, in a few cases also small clusters of epithelioid monocytes. Partial 
enlargement of the sinus, with larger monocytoid cells here in places. 
EVALUATION 
Primary diagnosis/diagnoses: 
Large, peripheral, bronchopulmonary, histologically predominantly large-cell, slightly to moderately 
differentiated, nonkeratinizing squamous cell carcinoma of the left lower lobe of the lung. TNM classification 
according to this picture pT2 pNO (0/23) VI RO. Stage m. C 34.3; M 8070/3. 
Secondary diagnosis/diagnoses: 
Partial necrotic tumor change with formation of a relatively large resorption lacuna. Tumor-associated active 
chronic, partially resorptive inflammation and also locally confined chronic fibrinous, partly already relatively 
high-grade fibrosing pleuritis. Signs suggestive of a slight respiratory bronchiolitis. Chronic bronchitis and 
small foci of fatty tissue metaplasia at the bronchus resection margin. Lymph node with slight anthracotic 
pigment deposits and to some extent marked reactive follicular hyperplasia. 
Remark/addendum: 
To a minimal extent the carcinoma has invaded the overlying visceral pleura, which is markedly fibrosed here. 
In a central direction, the tumor has partially infiltrated and destroyed the bronchi of the basal group, the main 
tumor mass being located in cranial sections of segment 10. Bronchus and vessel resection margins are tumor­
free.

KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS  
 Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma  
 RESULTS: Wild type gene.  INTERPRETATION: No mutations w ere identified at codons 12 and 13 of 
the KRAS gene.  
 COMMENT:  
Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to be associated with poor prognosis, and resistance to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies in patients with non -small- cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  KRAS  
mutations occur in 15-30% of NSCLC patients and are strongly associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking history.  This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene; based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of 
the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated for  
use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and codon 13 mutations in fresh, frozen, or formalin -fixed paraffin embedded tissue. In particular 
the test performance has been established in samples of colorectal  
cancer and non- small cell lung carcinoma which harbor these  
mutations, although several other tissues are also known to harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix, etc.).  
 Analysis of EGFR mutation or gene amplification status may provide additional information regarding this patient's probability of response to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies, if 
 clinically indicated. See references.  
 
METHOD/LIMITATION:  
Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is  
selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified  
and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to  
exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13; primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel  
electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

  EGFR Mutation Analysis  
 
 Referring Physician:  
 Body Site: Right upper lobe of lung  Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma  
 RESULTS: No mutation detected.  
 INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified in the sample provided for analysis. Fewer than 5% of non- small cell lung carcinoma  
patients without identifiable mutations are reported to  be 
responsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies.   COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more tumor cellularity is optimal  
for this mutation analysis. The sample submitted showed 30% tumor cellularity upon pathologist review.  A frequently occurring s equence change 2361G>A (Q787Q) was 
identified. This polymorphism is known not to have clinical significance.  
 Mutations in the tyrosine domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with differential  
responsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapies. The objective response rate among patients with a sensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%.  This assay analyzes exons 18 -21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain; 
based on the current liter ature, most mutations in non- small- cell 
lung carcinoma (NSCLC) are expected to occur in these exons.  
Mutations present in less than 10-20% of extracted DNA may not be detected by this method. Mutation status in a sample may change during tumor progression or the course of therapy; therefore, this result cannot be used to infer the presence or absence of a mutation in another sample or sub-sample obtained from this tumor. 
  
This test is validated for non- small cell lung carcinoma. The  
clinical significance an d utility of this test in other tumor types  
is unknown.  METHOD/LIMITATION:  
Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is  
selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the samples, quantified  
and amplified by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) using primers to  
exons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by bi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary gel  
electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or negative results may occur for reasons that include gene tic variants  
or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

 Fluorescence In -Situ Hybridization (FISH)  
 Specimen
MD 
Body Site: Right upper lobe of lung Specimen Type: Slides  
Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma  
 INTERPRETATION:  
Negative for a rearrangement involving the ALK gene.  
 Probe #Nuclei Examined % Positive Nuclei % Control values 2p23(ALK) 100 0 <15.0 A total of 100 cells were scored.  
 FINDINGS:  
FISH was performed on paraffin embedded tissue sections using the Vysis ALK Break Apart Probe for the ALK gene at 2p23 
When a rearrangement involving ALK is 
present, either inversi on or translocation, one of the two fusion 
signals separates as one red and one green signal. In this  
specimen, separated signals were present in 0% of the nuclei scored.  
This result is within the normal limits.  
 COMMENTS: Three to four copies of ALK were observed in 59.0% of cells. This gain of intact ALK fusion hybridization signals  
represents an aneuploid population with extra copies of chromosome 2/2p ALK region. Additional copies of ALK are not uncommon in NSCLCs, although the significance of extra copies of the ALK gene in  
lung carcinoma is unclear at this time

  The Vysis ALK Break Apart Probe FISH test is FDA  
approved for use in the detection of rearrangements involving the ALK gene via fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in formalin -fixed paraffin -embedded (FFPE) non- small cell lung cancer

removed and submitted as FSG. This is now transferred and submitted in its
entirety for permanent in cassette G1. Examination of the specimen reveals
multiple stapled margins and now removed bronchial margins with bronchi
containing apparent mucus plugging. These staples are removed from both
parenchyma and apparent vascular margins. The stapled parenchymal margin is
removed and the underlying tissue is inked black. The specimen is now
step-sectioned to reveal a well-defined mass that is 3.8 x 1.2 x 2.3 cm. The
mass abuts the pleura and is 0.1 cm from the parenchymal margin at is closest
relationship. It is 3.1 cm from the bronchial margin and 3.5 cm from thenearestvascular margin. Further sectioning through the specimen reveals no additional
masses. Representative sections from the specimen are now submitted as follows: G2 vascular margins;
G3-5 mass to parenchymal margin;

Two specimens received. 
1: The first specimen is labelled ""right middle lobe"" and consists ofa piece of lung measuring 123 x 
100 x 55 mm and weighing 232 g. An amount offat and pericardium is adherent to one surface wbile 
the pleura on the opposite side appears puckered. On sectioning a large tumour mass measuring 
approximately 53 x 45 x 57 mm is seen. This is approximately 11 mID away from the bronchial 
resection margin and extends through most of the specimen. The tumOUT bas a yellow nodular surface 
with a central necrotic area. The tumour is approximately 1 rom away from opposing pleural surfaces 
and 2 mm away from the pleural margin opposite the bronchial resection margin. The tumour extends 
to the area underlying the pericardium and fat and on sectioning appears to invade into the pericardium 
and fat. [Bronchial resection margin, lA; tumour near bronchial resection margin, 18; tumour and

Origin from a bronchus is not identified, and several bronchi within the tumour show no evidence of 
squamous metaplasia or dysplasia. The bronchial resection margin is clear of malignancy and shows 
no evidence of squamous metaplasia or dysplasia. Tumour is confumed to invade into the pericardium 
but does not extend through to the inner mesothelial -lined surface and is clear of the adjacent soft tissue 
resection margins. There is no evidence of pleural invasion on the opposite aspect of the specimen to 
the adherent pericardium. VRscutar, lymphatic and perineural invasion is present. Distant lung

Right upper lobe of lung,Right,Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma,T2N2MX,,Malignant,TCGA-78-7536.pdf,"RIGHT UPPER LOBE 
Clinical Details: 
RUL tumour. 
Three specimens received: 
1: RIGHT UPPER LOBE 
Macroscopy: 
The specimen is labelled ""right upper lobe"" and consists of a lobectomy measuring 145 x 120 x 60 mm 
in the inflated state. It is closed by a triradiate staple line. On the lateral aspect of the lung there are 
multiple fatty adhesions. In the posterior segment there appears to be a hard subpleural mass 
measuring approximately 53 mm in diameter. Adjacent to the bronchial resection margin there is a 
hard lymph node mass measuring 32 x 30 mm. On sectioning these lymph nodes have a white, yellow 
and black mottled appearance. On sectioning the mass measures 48 mm in diameter and it has a firm 
sclerotic appearance. There are possibly lymph node metastases adjacent to this apart from those 
adjacent to the bronchial resection margin. The surrounding lung is severely emphysematous with 
bulla formation. The lesion is subpleural but extends probably within 12 mm of the bronchial resection 
margin. Areas of necrosis are present within the tumour. Distal to the tumour there is evidence of 
obstructive pneumonitis. [Bronchial resection margin-I A; nodal mass adjacent to the bronchial 
resection margin 1 B-1 C; other peribronchial lymph nodes-I D; tumour and pleura IE-IF; tumour and 
adjacent pneumonitis-I G; inferior tumour mass with adjacent lymph nodes, uninvolved lung tissue-lI.] 
Microscopy: 
Sections show a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. The lesion is subpleural and there appears to be 
focal invasion into but not through the pleura. Fibrofatty adhesions are present on the surface. No 
blood vessel or perineural invasion is seen but there appears to be focal lymphatic permeation. Several 
peribronchial lymph nodes are involved by metastatic carcinoma. The tumour appears clear of the 
bronchial resection margin and there is no definite involvement of the soft tissue resection margin 
adjacent to the peribronchial lymph nodes. The adjacent lung shows severe centriacinar emphysema 
with bulla formation and distal to the tumour there is evidence of obstructive pneumonitis. 
2: NO.7 LYMPH NODE 
Macroscopy: 
The specimen is labelled ''No.7'' and consists of a nodal mass measuring 40 x 27 x 20 mm. On 
sectioning there are firm white masses present within the blackened lymph node parenc 
Microscopy: 
There is extensive replacement of the lymph node by metastatic poorly differentiated carcinoma. 
3: NO. 4R LYMPH NODE 
Macroscopy: 
The specimen is labelled ""No. 4R"" and consists of a piece of 
mm. On sectioning the lymph node contains firm pale nodules. 
Microscopy: measuring 25 x 20 x 14 
Sections show extensive replacement of the lymph node by metastatic poorly differentiated carcinoma. 
Summary: 
Right upper lobe of lung and peribronchial and mediastinal lymph nodes: 
1: Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma; 48 mm in maximal dimension. 
2: No blood vessel or perineural invasion present but lymphatic permeation identified .

    consists of a single stapled wedge biopsy of lung measuring 9.5 x  
    6.5 x 5 cm in greatest dimensions.  The pleural surface is inked 
and 
    the specimen is serially sectioned.  On cut section there is a 3.2

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION  
    cellular crowding with nuclear overlap and focal

    supportive of a well differentiated adenocarcinoma.  The rather  
    compact architecture in some areas and fibrosis is suggestive of an  
    invasive process.  It is difficult to assess for visceral pleural  
    invasion, and although there is a suspicious area (block 6), I 
would 
    recommend to assess with an elastic stain.

Lung,,Mixed bronchopulmonary adenocarcinoma with an acinar and papillary component and partly bronchioloalveolar growth pattern,pT2 pNX pMX RX,,Malignant,TCGA-05-4384.pdf," 
: 
Lung resection material with peripheral manifestation of  an evidently mucin -forming 
adenocarcinoma (sample 1) with a tubulopapillary structure and partly a bronchioloalveolar 
growth pattern,.  
Comment:  
According to conventional histology, this is a peripheral mixed bronchopulmonary 
adenocarcinoma with an acinar and papillary component and partly bronchioloalveolar growth pattern (immunohistological analysis and confirmation to follow), which has focally infiltrated the visceral pleura in the region of the pleural adhesion zone. The tumor extends as far as the basal row of metal clamps. Subject to the immune profile, the TNM classification on the basis of this material is thus pT2 pNX pMX RX (C34.3, M8255/3).  
1st follow- up report:  
The immu ne profile (positivity doe cytokeratin 7 and TTF1, focally also for cytokeratin 20 
and also negativity for CDX2) confirms the bronchopulmonary adenocarcinoma. 
  
"," 1. ""Site"": Lung. Justified as the report specifically mentions this is a lung resection material and the TNM code indicates it's a lung cancer (C34.3).
2. ""Laterality"": Not provided. The report does not specify whether the tumor is located on the left or right lung.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: 
sections from the lung show an infiltrating halfway differentiated 
squamous cell carcinoma. The tumor infiltrates a segmental bronchus, 
has penetrated it and ulcerated the mucosa. It is compressing the 
segmental artery which is not infiltrated by the tUmor. There are 5 
para-arterial lymph nodes, one of which shows metastatic tumor. The 
lung adjacent to the tumor shows interstitial follicular pneumonia and 
early acute supporative pneumonia. The pleura is thick and hemorrahgic 
and abutted, but not infiltrated by the tumor.

REPORT ON FINDINGS 
Macroscopy 
1.) Inflated, flxed resected lower lobe measuring 18 x 13.5 em at the base and up to 15 em high, central 
bronchus resection plane located distal to the bifurcation of B6. In the perihilar region some staple suture lines 
up to 4 em long. At the hilus is a 1 em lesioned grayish-black node. Pleura especially in the lateral and dorsal 
regions and -less markedly- in the basal region shows a vaguely pavement-like relief appearance. In segment 
8 a moderately flrm, pale brownish tumor, max. 5.4 em in size, mostly with a relatively clear and slightly 
arcuate demarcation, extending to within 0.3 em of the ventral pleura. Truncation of some subsegmental 
branches of B8 in the tumor. Questionable involvement by the tumor of at least one grayish-black pigmented 
node. Rest of the parenchyma shows diffuse induration and a pale color, in sections reticulate or streaky whitish 
pattern. In the lateral subpleural region at the junction of segments 9/10 is a disk-shaped blackish node 0.5 em 
in size. 
2.) Parietal pleura: plate-like, predominantly whitish tissue measuring 2.1 x 1.5 em and up to 0.4 em thick with 
partly shiny and partly slightly tubercular surface. 
3.) Lobar LN (station 12) middle lobe: 2 em lesioned node or node part. 
4.) Interlobar LN (station 11) right: three grayish-black node parts between 0.2 and 0.5 em. 
5.) Hilar LN (station 10) right: 1.2 em lesioned node or node part with sparse surrounding tissue. 
6.) Paraesophageal LN (station 8) right: 0.5 em node with some surrounding tissue. 
7.) Subcarinal LN (station 7): 1.8 em lesioned grayish-black node part with some surrounding tissue. 
8.) Low paratracheal LN (station 4): two lesioned grayish-black nodes or node parts, 1 and 1.2 em in size. 
9.) Hilar LN (station 10) left: 1.1 em lesioned node or node part with some surrounding tissue. 
Examined: 
1.) Tumor with remaining parenchyma + pleura, with questionable involvement of nodes, with bronchial 
branch, S6 + S 10 dorsal, subpleural node (halved), central bronchus resection plane and resection margins of 
vessels, hilar nodes, 
2.)-9.) All material (in 2. preparation lamellated, in 3., 5., 7.-9. nodes halved in each case),

 EVALUATION 
Primary diagnosis/diagnoses: 
From intetmediate to peripheral bronchopulmonary, histologically poorly differentiated, large-cell, focally 
keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma of the right lower lobe of the lung located in S8. 
TNM classification according to this picture pT2 pNO pMX VI RO, stage IB. 
C34.3 M8070/3. 
Secondary diagnosis/diagnoses: 
Focal, temporarily heterogeneous, chronic fibrosing interstitial pneumonia manifest in the mantle zone with 
fibrous and focally small honeycomb-like parenchyma remodeling and also focal bronchiolization detected in 
S6 (sample 1.)). Intrapulmonary, parabronchial and hilar lymph node of the main preparation and the lymph 
nodes of samples 3.) -9.) with uncharacteristic reactive lesions aud anthracotic pigment deposits. Hypocellular 
fibrosis zone of parietal pleura (sample 2.)). 
Remark/addendum: 
The carcinoma has invaded small to medium-sized blood vessels in the tumor. The visceral pleura, the resection 
plane of the bronchi and vessels and all lymph nodes identified and excised are tumor-free. 
No asbestos bodies are found in the prepared section planes, but much further-reaching investigations, 
especially dust analyses, are needed to determine the asbestos exposure of the lung. "," 1. Site: Right lower lobe. Justified as the report clearly mentions the tumor is located in the right lower lobe.
2. Laterality: Right. As the site is the right lower lobe, it's inherently a right-side location.
3. Histology: Large-cell, focally keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma. As mentioned in the primary diagnosis.
4. Stage: T2 pNO pMX VI RO, stage IB. This is the TNM classification provided for this case.
5. Grade: Not provided. The report mentions histological poor differentiation but does not provide a specific grade.
6. Behavior: Malignant. Implied as it's a cancer (carcinoma) and the report states that the carcinoma has invaded small to medium-sized blood vessels in the tumor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HISTORY 
NSCC LLL with? Nl metastases. 
MACROSCOPIC 
Four specimens received: 
1: The first specimen is labelled ""left lung"" and consists of a left pneumonectomy specimen which 
measures 180 x 150 x 40 mm. Located in the apex of the left lower lobe is a large peripheral tumour 
measuring 70 x 65 x 45 mm. There is some puckering of the overlying pleura above the tumour but 
definite invasion to the pleura cannot be identified grossly. Many enlarged hilar lymph nodes and 
intraparenchymallymph nodes are identified but none of these show macroscopic evidence of tumour 
involvement. Elsewhere the visceral pleura and parenchyma show prominent carbon pigmentation. 
The visceral pleura at the apex of the left upper lobe shows a cream papule. No other lesions are 
identified grossly. [1 A, bronchial and pulmonary artery hilar resection margin; 1 B-1 C, bronchial 
lymph node; ID, interlobar lymph node; lE-lG, tumour with overlying pleura; IH-lJ, 
intraparenchymallymph nodes from left lower lobe; lK, intraparenchymallymph nodes from left 
upper lobe; lL, lung away from tumour in left lower lobe; 1M, lung from left upper lobe; IN, further 
section of tumour and adjacent uninvolved parenchyma.] 
2: The second specimen is labelled ""hilar lymph node No.1"" and consists of a lymph node measuring 
6 mm in diameter. [BIT, 2A.] 
3: The third specimen is labelled ""No.2 hilar lymph node"" and consists of two fragments of nodal 
tissue, the largest measuring approximately 12 mm in diameter. [Bisected, blocked with smaller 
fragment,3A.] 
4: The fourth specimen is labelled ""lymph node No.8"" and consists of two fragments of nodal tissue, 
the largest measuring approximately 1 0 mm in diameter. The other fragment appears to contain 
multiple nodes on sectioning. [Each fragment bisected, BIT, 4A-4B.] 
MICROSCOPY 
1: Sections show a moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma which abuts but does not 
invade the pleura. There are extensive areas of tumour necrosis and several blood vessels within the 
tumour are obliterated but definite vascular invasion is not found. No lymphatic or perineural 
infiltration is seen. Peribronchial lymph nodes show reactive hyperplasia, anthracosis and a few small 
silicotic nodules but defmite tumour metastases are not found. However metastatic carcinoma is 
present within intraparenchymallymph nodes from the left lower lobe (lJ). A single fragment sampled 
as a peribronchial lymph node appears to represent a fragment of the primary tumour (lD). Lung 
parenchyma away from the tumour shows a marked degree of peribronchial and interlobular septal 
anthracosis. There is also upper lobe emphysema and pleural fibrosis. 
2: Sections show a small lymph node in which there is no evidence of malignancy. 
3: Sections show partial replacement of the lymph node by metastatic adenocarcinoma. 
4: Sections show reactive lymph nodes with anthracosis and occasional silicotic nodules. There is no 
evidence of metastatic carcinoma. 
SUMMARY 
Left pneumonectomy and lymph node sampling : 
Moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, 70 mm in diameter. 
No pleural, vascular or perineural infiltration seen. 
Metastases in intraparenchymal and hilar lymph nodes. 
Pathological stage T2 Nl.

The sample consists of a fragment of soft tissue measuring 3.5 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm. Microscopic examination reveals features consistent with a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST), WHO Grade III. No specific sites of origin are identified, but the lesion is abutting and possibly arising from a nerve bundle. There is no evidence of residual schwannoma or neurofibroma within this sample. The specimen shows focal areas of tumor necrosis. Mitotic activity is brisk (>10 mitoses/10 high power fields). Surgical margins are widely involved by the tumor. No lymphovascular invasion is identified.

1. ""Site"": not provided, as the report does not specify a clear site of origin for the tumor.
2. ""Laterality"": not provided, as the report does not mention whether the tumor is on the left or right side.
3. ""Histology"": malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST), as stated in the report. (""The lesion is abutting and possibly arising from a nerve bundle and shows features consistent with a MPNST, WHO Grade III."")

D
iagnosis:  
1. Atypical resection material from the indicated upper lobe of the lung with an infiltrate of poorly differentiated and non-mucigenous, pulmonary adenocarcinoma, of max. 3.2 cm in size. 
 Tumor classification:  
M-8140/3, G 3, pT 2, pV 1, pN 2, pM x, stage III A. R0.   Immunohistological follow -up report 
In the region of the tumor cells there is an absence of cytokeratin 5 expression. Some of the tumor cells co -express cytokeratin 7 and 20 and most show nuclear expression of TTF-1. 
There is also marked CEA expression. The proliferation marker Mib- 1 (61-67) moderately 
high with staining of about 30% of tumor cell nuclei.  Assessment:  
The marker spectrum especially with the diffuse and marked nuclear expression of TTF-1 supports the diagnosis of primary pulmonary adenocarcinoma.  
  
"," 1. ""Site"": Lung. Justified by the diagnosis mentioning atypical resection material from the lung.
2. ""Laterality"": Not provided. The report does not specify if the left or right lung is affected.
3. ""Histology"": Adenocarcinoma, as stated in the diagnosis and supported by the tumor classification (M-8140/3).
4. ""Stage"": IIIA (T2N2Mx). The tumor invaded the pulmonary pleura (pT2), there are metastases in 4-6 lymph nodes (pN2) and no distant metastasis (pMx). This corresponds to stage IIIA.
5. ""Grade"": III. The grade is not explicitly stated, but the tumor is described as poorly differentiated (G3), which would correspond to Grade III.
6. ""Behavior"": Malignant. This is inherent in the diagnosis of cancer; the report also mentions invasion of the pulmonary pleura and lymph node metastases.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CLINICAL HISTORY AND PRE - OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  
ex-smoker (20 pack -years), now with a 2.6 cm LUL nodule.  
 
MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:  
The specimen is received in eight parts, each labeled with the  
patient's name.  
 
1. Part  one is received fresh, labeled 'left upper lobe nodule r/o  
carcinoma'. It consists of a wedge biopsy of the lung measuring 10  
x 5 x 2.5 cm. The specimen is received previously incised. Also  
noted two stapled lines measuring 10 cm and 3.5 cm. The stapled l ine 
is shaved and the pleura around the staple is inked black. Also  
noted on pleura is focal puckering and fibrotic area. Cutting into  
the specimen reveals a grey -white firm nodule measuring 1.5 x 1.5 x  
1 cm. The nodule located is 1.5 cm and 1 cm from both stapled lines.  
Frozen section performed on the nodule and resubmitted for permanent  
section. The remainder of the parenchyma is pink -red blotchy and  
crepitant. Representative sections are submitted.  
 
2. Part two is received in saline, labeled 'station 8 lymph node'.  
It consists of two pieces of tan and black soft tissue measuring 1.0  
x 0.5 x 0.4 cm and 0.6 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm. The specimen is submitted 
entirely in one cassette.

0.2 cm. The specimen is submitted entirely in one cassette.  
 
5. Part five is received fresh, labeled 'left upper lobectomy'. It  
 consists of a 174 gram upper lobe of the left lung measuring 18 x 8  
x 3.7 cm. Along the pleural surface of the lung, is a row of  
surgi cal staples extending from the anterior medial apex, obliquely  
along the anterior lateral pleura for a length of 13.5 cm. The 
visceral pleura is smooth, reddish purple from subpleural hemorrhage  
and outlined by black lymphatics. The area surrounding the st aples  
on the anterior surface is inked in green, and the staples are  
removed revealing dark -red lung parenchyma with a homogeneous cut  
surface. The lung is serially sectioned and no lesions are grossly  
seen or palpated. Representative sections are submitted in seven  
cassettes.  
 6. Part six is received in saline, labeled 'station 6 lymph node'.

  ADDENDUM # 2 FOR MOLECULAR TESTS:  
 
KRAS and EGFR were sent on or patient  
The test is to be performed on tissue from case  
The case report, slides, and blocks for the cited  
accession number were retrieved from archives. The pathologist whose  
signature appears below reviewed the original pathology report,  
examined candidate H&E slides, and selected block 1D appropriate to  
the specifications of the ordered molecular analysis. x1 H&E and x9  
unstained slides were prepared and forwarded to  where the  
subject molecular test will be performed. An addendum report will be  
issued when the results of this molecular test are available.  
 
  Addendum #1 performed by  
 
    
ADDENDUM 2:  
  
 
 
RESULTS: Positive for a p.G12A (c.35G>T) mutation in codon 12 of  
the KRAS gene.  
 
INTERPRETATION: Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to  
correlate with poor prognosis and resistance to tyrosine kinase 
inhibitor therapies in patients with non- small lung cancer.  
 COMMENT:  
KRAS mutations occur in 15- 30% of non- small- cell lung cancer (NSCLC)  
patients and are strongly associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking history.  
 This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;  
based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are  
expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of  
the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low  
percentage of cells may not be detected.  
 
This test is validated for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and  
codon 13 mutations in fresh, frozen, or formalin- fixed paraffin 
embedded tissue. In particular the test performance has been  
established in samples of colorectal cancer and non- small cell lung  
carcinoma which harbor these mutations, although several other  
tissues are also known to harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of  
pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix, etc.).  
 
METHOD/L IMITATION: 
 
Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is  
selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified  
and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to 
exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single  
nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;  
primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel  
electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or  
negative results may occur for reasons that inc lude genetic variants  
or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

EGFR Mutation Analysis  
 
Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma  
 RESULTS: No mutation detected  
 INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified; however 18- 20% of  
patients with non- small- cell lung cancer and without identifiable  
mutations are reported to be responsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase  
inhibitor therapies.  
 
  
COMMENT: This assay analyzes exons 18- 21 of the EGFR tyrosine  
kinase domain; based on the current literature, the vast majority of  
mutations are expected to occur in these exons. The analytical  
sensitivity of the assay is 10- 20%, thus mutations present in a low  
percentage of cells may not be detected.  
 Most data published to date pertain to gefitinib (Iressa(r)).  
Similar da ta have been seen in studies using erlotinib (Tarceva(r)).  
 Homozygosity for the frequently occurring sequence change 2361 G>A  
was identified. The polymorphism is not likely to have clinical  
significance.  
 This test is validated for non- small cell lung carcinoma. The 
clinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types  
is unknown.  
 
METHOD:  
Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is  
selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the samples, quantified  
and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to 
exons 18- 21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by  
bi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary gel  
electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or  
negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants  
or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

ain diagnosis/diagnoses:  
Pulmonary wedge resection material with peripheral manifestation of a focally mucin -forming 
adenocarcinoma (sample 1.)) showing a predominantly tubular or acinar structure, in parts a 
bronchioloalveolar growth pattern and a small solid and papillary component.  
Comment/supplementary remark:   
According to the conventional histology, the findings are consistent with a peripheral mixed 
bronchopulmonary adenocarcinoma (C 34.1, M 8255/3), the TNM classification of which on the basis of these samples is pT2 pN0 pMX L1 V1 RX, corresponding to stage IB. (Immunohistological analysis as to the tumor’s point origin will follow.) The tumor shows foci of infiltration in the visceral pleura and extends to the basal resection margin, which gives rise to RX classification from the patho -anatomical viewpoint.  
 The immune profile (positive for cytokeratin 7 and TTF-1, negative for cytokeratin 20 and CDX-2) confirms the bronchopulmonary origin of the tumor.  
"," 1. ""Site"": Lung. Justification: The report clearly states that this is a pulmonary wedge resection and the subsequent discussion refers to the lung as the location of the tumor.

  MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY  
 KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS  
 
 
 RESULTS: Wild -type gene  
 
 INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified at codons 12 and 13 
of the KRAS gene.  COMMENT:  
Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to be associated with  poor 
prognosis, and resistance to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies in patients with non -small- cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  
 KRAS mutations occur in 15-30% of NSCLC patients and are strongly associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking history.  This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene; 
based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated  
for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and codon 13 mutations in fresh, frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue. In particular the test performance has been established in samples of colorectal cancer and non -small cell lung carcinoma which harbor  
these mutations, although several other tissues are also known to harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix, etc.).  Analysis of EGFR mutation or gene ampl ification status may provide  
additional information regarding this patient's probability of response to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies, if clinically indicated. See references.  
 METHOD/LIMITATIONS:  
Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologis t and relevant tumor is  
selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified  
and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13; primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel  
electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

  INTEGRATED ONCOLOGY  
  EGFR Mutation Analysis  
 
 
 
 Body Site: Left lower lobe of lung  
 
Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma  
 RESULTS: Positive for the E746_A750del5 mutation in Exon 19.  
 INTERPRETATION: Deletion mutations in exon 19, mostly involving the  
LREA motif, are reported to correlate with responsiveness to EGFR  
tyrosine kinase inhibitor in patients with non- small- cell lung  
carcinoma.  
  COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more tumor ce llularity is optimal  
for this mutation analysis. The sample submitted showed 80% tumor  
cellularity upon pathologist review.  
 E746_A750del5 corresponds to 2236_2250del15.  A frequently occurring sequence change 2361G>A (Q787Q) was  
identified. This polymorphism is known not to have clinical  
significance.  
 Mutations in the tyrosine domain of the epidermal growth factor  
receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with differential  
responsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)  
therapies. The objective response rate among patients with a  
sensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%.  
 This assay analyzes exons 18 -21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain;  
based on the current literature, most mutations in non- small- cell 
lung carcinoma (NSCLC ) are expected to occur in these exons.  
Mutations present in less than 10- 20% of extracted DNA may not be  
detected by this method. Mutation status in a sample may change  
during tumor progression or the course of therapy; therefore, this  
result cannot be us ed to infer the presence or absence of a mutation  
in another sample or sub- sample obtained from this tumor. 
 This test is validated for non- small cell lung carcinoma. The  
clinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types  
is unknown.  METH OD/LIMITATION:  
Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is  
selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the samples, quantified  
and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to exons 18- 21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by   bi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary gel  
electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or 
negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

"," Site: Left lower lobe of lung
Laterality: Not provided
Histology: Adenocarcinoma
Stage: Not provided
Grade: Not provided
Behavior: Malignant (as inferred from the context of molecular testing for cancer)

Justification for the choice: The report includes an addendum for KRAS mutation analysis, which is commonly associated with adenocarcinoma in lung cancer. Additionally, there is a separate addendum for EGFR mutation analysis, and the sample is positive for a deletion mutation in exon 19, which is reported to correlate with responsiveness to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy in patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma. Therefore, it can be inferred that the site information refers to the left lower lobe of the lung, and the histology is adenocarcinoma.

Clinical Details: 
Left pneumonectomy for bronchogenic carcinoma. 
Two specimens received: 
I: LEFT LUNG 
Macroscopy: 
The upper lobe measures 160 x 110 x 35 mm in an infused state and displays an apical scar. The 
lingular appears collapsed. Centriacinar emphysema is apparent on sectioning the upper lobe. Distal 
airways contain mucus. The lower lobe measures 160 x 120 x 60 mm an in infused state. There is a 
large tumour involving the lateral basal segment of the inferior lobe, measuring 55 x 38 x 25 mm in 
maximum dimension. The tumour abuts the pleura and the pleura is slightly irregular over its surface. 
Lymph nodes at the hilum of the lower lobe are obviously involved by metastatic tumour. No 
endobronchial tumour is identified. Tumour extends to within 45 mm of bronchial resection margin. 
On sectioning, the tumour is solid and cream in colour and displays a central area of necrosis. It has a 
well circumscribed margin. The uninvolved lung parenchyma displays mild centriacinar emphysema.

Molecular AnatomiC Pathology testing: 
A. KRAS Exon 1 mutation IS IDENTIFIED (Gly12Cys). 
B. EGFR Exon 19 mutation NOT Identified. 
C. EGFR Exon 21 mutation NOT identified. 
Note: 
KRAS codon 12113 mutations are found In approximately 10-30% lung adenocarcinomas and associated with history of 
smoking (1). EGFR exon 19 and 21 mutations are present in about 10% of non-Asians and up to 40% In the Asian 
population. common in non-smokers and associated with the tumor response to treatment with EGFR inhibitors (2). 
These mutations are mutually exclusive and their presence may have prognostic and/or therapeutic implications (3,4). 
~/e Preparation and Gene Sequencina Analvsis 
For cytology samples, extractJon of DNA was performed from the fluid or sample provided. For surgical specimens, tumor microdissection was 
perform$d DNA was /,soleted using standard laboratory procedure. Optical density readings were obtained. For tile detection of mutatron, DNA 
was amplified with primers fla.1k,ing exon 1 in the KRAS gene and exons 19 snd 21 of the EGFR gene. Then, forward and reverse sequencing was 
performed USing the BigDye Terminator Kit on ABI3130 (Applied Biosystems). The known hotspots were analyzed for the presence of mutations 
With Mutation Surveyor V3.01 (SoftGenetics). 
Addendum 
PROBE: Vysis LSI EGFR SDectrumOrangel CEP 7 SpectrumGreen ™ Probe 
Fluorescence in-situ hybridization studies performed On the adenocarcinoma centromere of 
chromosome 7 of 1.2 indicating no EGFR amplification in the targeted region. The rate of hyperploidy for the centromere of 
chromosome 7 was 26% of the analyzed celis. The signal to nucleus ratio (SNR) for the EGFR gene was 2.5. 
Interpretation guidelines for EGFR Gene Copy Number by FISH: 
Ratio of EGFR to the centromere of chromosome 7: 
Less than 2.0: No EGFR amplification 
Greater than 2.0: EGFR amplification 
Hyperploidy: Greater than two centromere copies/cell. 
SNR: The average number of EGFR signals per analyzed ceil within the targeted region. 
Clinical stUdies show high EGFR gene copy number by FISH analysis to be associaled with favorable clinical benefit (clinical

DIAGNOSIS 
A. Lung, left upper lobe, excisional biopsy: 
Well to moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. 
"," 1. ""Site"": Lung. Justification: The report clearly states the specimen is from the left upper lobe of the lung.
2. ""Laterality"": Left. Justification: The report mentions ""left upper lobe"" confirming the laterality.
3. ""Histology"": Adenocarcinoma. Justification: The frozen section diagnosis and final diagnosis both confirm the histology as adenocarcinoma.
4. ""Stage"": T1 N0, based on the TNM stage mentioned in the microscopic description (T1: tumor size 1.5 em, NO: no regional lymph node metastasis).
5. ""Grade"": Well to moderately differentiated (Grade I-II). Justification: The report mentions ""Well to moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma"" in the final diagnosis.
6. ""Behavior"": Malignant. Justification: This is inherent in the diagnosis of cancer; malignancy implies the ability of the tumor to invade surrounding tissues and potentially spread to other parts of the body.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"" ""'~~~ MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
A. Nine slides are examined. The bronchial margin appears on cassette 1 and 
does not show any evidence of involvement by tumor. Portions of vascular 
'; margin appear on cassette 2 without evidence of tumor involvement. Three 
hilar lymph nodes are present 6n slide 3. All of them show extensive 
replacement by non-oat cell carcinoma. Portions of lung mass are seen on 
slides 4 through 7. The tumor demonstrates extensive necrosis on slide 4. and 
the remaining pattern is that of a moderately to poorly differentiated 
carcinoma with numerous areas showing clear cells along with typical malignant 
glands. There is extensive intrapulmonary lymphatic and vascular invasion. 
Pleural lymphatics on slide 4 are filled with plugs of tumor and both veins 
and lymphatics of the interlobular septum show tumor involvement on the same 
slide. Ex ensive involvement of the vis eral leura is also oted on slide

I have personally reviewed all specimens and or slides ,including the
listed special stains ,and used them with my medical judgement to
determine the final diagnosis.
CLINICAL HISTORY:
The patient is a year-old man with a history of right lung cancer who
undergoes lobectomy with lymph node staging and immediate frozen section
diagnosis.
GROSS:
Nine specimens are received ,each labeled with the patient 's name and
hospital identification number.
A. Specimen A is designated ""lymph node, station 7."" The specimen consists of a 2.1 x 1.2 x 0.5 cm red-tan tissue fragment. The
specimen is submitted in cassette A for frozen section diagnosis.
B. Specimen B is designated ""lymph node, station 7."" The
specimen consists of a 2.0 x 1.8 x 0.8 cm aggregate of friable, tan-red
and irregularly-shaped soft tissue fragments. All fragments are
submitted in two cassettes.
C. Specimen C is designated ""lymph node, 10 R."" The specimen
consists of a 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm segment of adipose tissue. The
specimen is submitted in cassette C for frozen section diagnosis.
D. Specimen D is designated ""lymph node, 12 R #2."" The
specimen consists of a red/black tissue fragment measuring 0.8 x 0.5 x
0.4 cm and 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.1 cm. Both fragments are submitted in cassette
D for frozen section diagnosis.
E. Specimen E is designated ""lymph node station 10 R."" The
specimen consists of a 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm tan-red soft tissue fragment.
The specimen is submitted in cassette E.
F. Specimen F is designated ""lymph node, 10 R #3."" The
specimen consists of a 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.3 cm tan-gray aggregate of soft
tissue. All fragments are submitted in cassette F for frozen section
diagnosis. G. Specimen G is designated ""lung, right upper lobe bronchial
margin."" The specimen consists of a 263 gm right lower lobectomy
measuring 14.3 x 10.2 x 6.0 cm. The pleural surface is remarkable for a
underlying mass adjacent to the bronchus. The bronchial margin is
removed and submitted enface for frozen section diagnosis. The
remainder of the pleural surface is inked blue. The specimen is
sectioned revealing an exophytic, tan-white, solid-appearing lesion
measuring 5.0 x 4.9 x 3.9 cm. The lesion is adjacent to the hilum and
0.1 cm from the bronchial margin. This lesion appears to abut the
serosal surface, where no serosal extension is noted. Sectioning the
remainder of the lung parenchyma has a consolidated, tan-red appearance
with areas of mucus plugging. No additional mass or lesions are
present. Representative tissue was procured for potential future
studies. The specimen is sampled in 14 cassettes.
Summary of Cassettes:
G1- bronchial margin, en face (frozen section).
G2 - three potential lymph nodes.
G3 - single lymph node bisected.
G4 - vascular margin.
G5-G7 - tumor closest to dominant airway.
G8-G11 - additional tumor with adjacent soft tissue.
G12-G14 - uninvolved lung parenchyma. H. Specimen H is designated ""lymph node station 4 R."" The
specimen consists of three tan-red, spongy-appearing tissue fragments
ranging in size from 2.0 to 0.8 cm in greatest dimension. All fragments
are submitted intact in two cassettes.
1. Specimen I is designated ""lung wedge biopsy, right middle
lower lobe wedge."" The specimen consists of a thin, tan-red wedge
excision measuring 4.0 x 0.8 x 0.3 cm. The polar surface is submitted
intact. The staple line is identified and removed and the new
parenchymal margin is inked blue. The specimen is sectioned revealing a
spongy, red, unremarkable cut surface. The specimen is entirely
submitted in two cassettes.
Summary of Cassettes:
11-12 - right middle lower lobe wedge, entirely submitted.

Microscopic Description:
Sections of specimen #2 show a large cell malignant neoplasm that in
areas shows prominent gland formation. These glandular area blend
into more solid nests of neoplastic cells. These are supported by a
dense fibrous stroma and alternate with areas of necrosis. The
neoplasm extends into the pleural but not onto the pleural surface.
Sections of the neoplasm within the right upper lobe specimen #3
show a large cell malignant neoplasm with a distinctly different
growth pattern. In this neoplasm the cells form sheets that have
irregular borders. The cells have a moderate amount of eosinophilic
cytoplasm and enlarged pleomorphic nuclei.
Sections of the lymph node specimens show no areas of metastatic
carcinoma.
lmmunohistochemical stains are performed on the neoplasm in the
right lower lobe specimen and right upper lobe specimen. The right lower lobe specimen shows the neoplasm to be positive for CK7 andnegative for CK20 .Some of the cells are strongly positive for
TTF1. These are in the more glandular areas .The more solid areasare negative for this marker .The more solid areas do express
positivity for CDX -2 where the glandular areas tend to be negative
for this marker .The cells are negative for p63 .This staining
pattern would support this being an adenocarcinoma of pulmonary
origin .It is unclear why some of the cells mark with the
colorectal marker CDX-2. This same panel performed on the right
upper lobe specimen show the neoplastic cells to be negative for
both CK7 and CK20. The cells are negative for CDX-2 and TTF1. Thecells are strongly positive for p63 .This staining pattern would
support this being a squamous carcinoma that is very poorly
differentiated .The immunohistochemical control slides stain
appropriately.

1.) Right lung: inflated, fixed right lung measuring 14 x 12 em at the base and up to 26 em high, central 
bronchus resection plane located 1 em upstream of the upper lobe bronchus. Dorsomedial and basal pleura over 
S10 shows an area of max. 7.5 x 4 em with roughening or residual adhesion, in the basal region over S7 is a 3 
em similar area, Intermediate bronchus in the region of the middle lobe bronchus bifurcation and proximal 
sections of the bronchi of the basal group narrowed by a moderately firm, predominantly pale brownish-white 
tumor with small patches of grayish-black pigmentation, max. 4.7 em in size, with unclear and arcuate 
demarcation, with the main mass in SIO and adjacent sections ofS6, S7 and S9, extending to within 0.2 em of

tumor. Focal crossing of lower pleural fissure and infiltration of middle lobe. In the tumor environment some 
satellite foci up to 0.2 em in size. Peripheral sections of basal bronchial branches dilated and filled with thick 
mucus. Parenchyma below the adhesion zone over SIO shows diffuse induration and a brown vitreous 
appearance. In the mediocaudal region of the upper lobe bronchus bifurcation next to the pulmonary artery a 2.5 
em node firmly adherent to the vascular wall with predominantly whitish section surfaces and extension right up

Microscopy 
Re 1.) Tumor made up to solid structures of large atypical epithelia, densely packed in parts, with copious, 
mostly stained cytoplasm with the inclusion of isolated very large, otl1erwise often round, occasionally 
deformed nuclei containing granular chromatin and always prominent nucleoli. Apoptoses, not uncommonly 
several mitoses per markedly enlarged visual field (field length 0.61 mm). Occasionally a vague epidermoid 
layer, often intercellular fissures and isolated visible bridges. No mucin inclusion. In places a dissociation of the 
tumor cell structures. Smaller areas of necrosis. Affected lung parenchyma pmtly destroyed, likewise a 
 relatively a large bronchus here, strand of cartilage remaining. A further large bronchus partially infiltrated and 
involved in the tumor, likewise in this area smaller bronchi and bronchioles whose lumen is partly dilated, the 
original respiratory epithelium replaced by tumor epithelium. In adjacent region tumor cell nests and fonnations 
of small tumor lie freely in alveoli, also tumor cell structures in dilated lymph vessels. Vascularized interlobular 
septa. between the tumor formations partly loose, partly fiber-rich, collagenous connective tissue with 
accumulation of iuflammatmy cells. Isolated small vessels here, walls thickened by elastosis and containing 
tumor cells. A larger vein surrounded, loose capillary-containing fiber tissue in the lumen. Between peripheral 
tumor margin and visceral pleura on the medial side a strip of free lung parenchyma with partly deficient 
atelectasis and thickened alveolar septa. Lower pleural fissure and partly fused visceral pleura demarcating or 
covering this fissure transcended by tumor, where large bronchi are invaded to within close proximity of the 
mucosa. Large tumor node next to the upper lobe bronchus bifurcation, enclosed anthracotic pigment, tumor 
cell nests here at the resection margin. In the mediastinal tissue a further tumor-compromised lymph node with 
anthracotic pigment deposits and otherwise fibrous growth of connective tissue. In subpleural region of Sl a flat 
remodeling zone of the lung parenchyma with development of collagenous and elastic connective tissue, with 
alveolar stroma still partly recognizable. Nearby tiny radial areas of interstitial fibrosis with small patches of 
accumulated anthracotic pigment. In the basal lower lobe am relatively large area of nonoxygenated, fibrosed 
lung parenchyma with inclusion of partly obliterated smaller, partly patent vessels and bronchioles. Overlying 
pleura markedly enlarged and fibrotic. Otherwise here and there in dilated peripheral ainvays mucus and 
leukocytes and also a small cluster of pigment-storing macrophages in the alveoli. At the bronchus resection 
margin, sections of mucosal epithelium are interrupted, othenvise regular. Here as in the walls of the large 
pulmonary vessels no evidence of tumor cells. Lymph node at the hilus with isolated secondary follicles, slight 
plaque of anthracotic pigment and foci oflarge macrophages. 
Re 2.) -b.) Partly preserved lymph nodes with few secondary follicles, varying degrees of anthracotic pigment 
deposits, accumulation of macrophages and isolated secondary follicles. In parts, lymph nodes are largely 
occupied by solid epithelial tumor. In places, tumor manifestation also in the paranodal tissue. At one point and 
in a larger lymph node only very small areas occupied by tumor cell nests. 
EVALUATION 
Primary diagnosis/diagnoses: 
Central bronchopulmonary, histologically largely undifferentiated, large-cell squamous cell carcinoma of the 
right lower lobe of the lung (C4) with overgrowth of the interlobar fissure and continuous growth into the 
adjacent section of the middle lobe and also several in some cases large lymph node metastases. Tumor 
classification according to this picture pT2 pN3 Ll VI Rl, stage IIIB. C34.3 M8070/3. 
Secondary diagnosis/diagnoses: 
Peripheral bronchiolectasia in the lower lobe, relatively large fibrous cicatricial remodeling zone in S I 0 
mediobasal and similar flat subpleural cicatricial zones in Sl apical. Local high-grade pleural fibrosis over SlO. 
Twnor-associated inflammation and small tumor necroses. Slight anthracotic pigment deposits in the lung 
parenchyma and relatively marked in some lymph nodes. 
Remark/addendum: 
The main mass of the carcinoma lies in SJO. Centrally it has grown as far as the bifurcations of the lower lobe 
main bronchus and the middle lobe bronchus, without these being destroyed or constricted. The tumor invasion 
of small blood vessels only concerns the focal region, the lymphangioinvasion is more marked and is also 
located in the vicinity of the tumor focus. The Rl classification is based on the fmding that carcinoma nests in 
the large involved lymph nodes next to the bifurcation of the upper lobe bronchus extend to the mediastinal 
resection plane. Further lymph node metastases are seen at the intermediate bronchus in the mediastinum and 
also in the lymph nodes located under 4.) -6.). The pN3 classification is also made with regard to the previous 
finding with carcinoma cell structures in the fine needle aspiration biopsy from LN4 left (according to clinical 
data). "," Site: Central bronchopulmonary carcinoma in the right lower lobe of the lung

Procedure:   
 
Diagnosis 
A.  Lung, left lower lobe, excision - 
Poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (see microscopic 
description). 
Margins negative for malignancy. 
Metastatic carcinoma in three of fourteen (3/14) hilar lymph nodes. 
 
B,C,D.  Lymph nodes, level 9, level 7, and level 5, excisions - 
Negative for tumor. 
 
Microscopic Description: 
Histologic type: Squamous cell carcinoma comprising the mass lesion in 
part A 
Histologic grade: Poorly differentiated 
Primary tumor (pT):  pT2a.  The carcinoma is 3.5 cm in greatest 
dimension.  To the extent assessable given fragmentation, there is not 
pleural invasion. 
Margins of resection: Negative 
Direct extension of tumor: Not definitively identified 
Vascular invasion: Not identified 
Regional lymph nodes (pN):  pN1.  There is metastatic carcinoma in 
three of fourteen (3/14) hilar lymph nodes identified in part A.  The 
separately submitted lymph nodes in parts B, C, & D are negative for 
tumor. 
Distant metastasis (pM):  Not applicable 
Other findings: Scattered chronic inflammation and emphysematous 
changes 
 Note:  The carcinoma immunostains for p63 and not for TTF- 1, nor does 
it immunostain for synaptophysin or chromogranin.  This supports 
classification of this non- small cell carcinoma as poorly 
differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. 
 
[A few of the antibodies used in our laboratory may be classified as 
analyte specific reagents.  These antibodies are monitored and 
controlled in our laboratory and their perforance for in vitro 
diagnosis is well described in the medical literature.  They have not

Gross Description 
A.  Received fresh in a container labeled ""left lower lobe"" is a 187 g, 
18 x 9.5 x 5 cm, lobectomy specimen.  The bronchial stump is 1.5 cm 
long and without focal lesion.  The vascular margin is also grossly 
unremarkable.  The pleural surface is smooth glistening tan- red.  There 
is a torn area on the pleural surface revealing a 3.5 x 3 x 2.5 cm 
tan-pink mass.  Although the prior tearing limits assessment, the mass 
does not appear to involve the pleura.  The lung away from the mass is 
spongy and tan- pink, without additional lesions.  There are gray- black 
lymph nodes in the hilar region up to 0.8 cm in greatest dimension. 
RS-12, following fixation, according to the accompanying block summary. 
 Please note tissue is taken for tissue procurement per the clinical 
request.

GROSS 
A. HRight upper lobe freeze bronchial margins ."" Received fresh for 
immediate evaluation and frozen section analysis is a partly 
collaps ed lobe of lung, which has a small a'llount of hemorrhage over 
the surface . Most of the pleural surfaces are smooth, glistening 
and light to medium purple-brown. It weighs 2ilO grams. The 
bronchial resection margin portion of the most hilar aspect of the 
specimen is a bronchus 1.1 x 0.9 em across. This resection margin 
is shaved from the specimen and submitted as a frozen section block. 
Two nodules are palpated in the upper aspect of the lobe and both 
show some degree of overlying puckering of the pleural surfaces . 
These are marked by me with blue dye. The more lateral lesion is 
cut across and reveals a subpleural , Io.'hite and gray speckled lesion 
2.0 x 1.7 cm on cut surface. A portion of this is removed for the 
tumor genome project in the usual manner. The second nodule, which 
is more apically situated , has its epicenter about 2 em away from 
the lesion mentioned above and has more of a yellowish cut surface , 
is well circumscribed and up to 1.8 x 1.7 cm and presents focally 
just beneath the pleural surface, also with some overlying puckeri ng 
of plerua. A portion of this tumor is also sampled for the tumor 
genome project . 
After preparat ion of the frozen section, the frozen section remnant 
is placed in a block and the remainder of the tissue is fixed prior 
to further processing .

FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS 
A. Bronchial resection margin negative for tumor. - MICROSCOPIC 
A. The frozen section control confirms the frozen section findings 
of a proximal bronchial resection margin that is negative for tumor. 
The t\'10 foci containing gross tumor, the more laterally situated and 
the more atypically situated have identical histology with areas 
showing adenocarcinoma growing in scar tissue \"",ith some areas 
showing more clear cell patterns to the cytoplasm and other areas 
having more eosinophilic and darker cytoplasm . Some of the latter 
tumor grows in a lepidic pattern including focally into the visceral 
pleura, with at least one small focus deposited and stuck to the 
outside of the visceral pleura ). Deeper sections have been 
made of these foci. The section taken between the two nodules, 
although not grossly involved, has microscopic involvement of 
additional invasive adenocarcinoma which therefore shows a 
connection between these two otherwise apparently separate nodules . 
Thus, I think this is a single tumor with a so-called dumbbell shape 
and both foci of tumors making the larger nodules have mixtures of 
clear-type cytoplasm and eosinophilic-type cytoplasm . Emphysema is 
also found within the lung. 
A focus of tumor shows growth into a thick-walled blood vessel, 
probably a vein. A single parabronchial lymph node is found and is 
negative for metastatic disease.

 CLINICAL HISTORY AND PRE - OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  
Lung mass.  
 
MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:  
The specimen is received in four parts, each labeled with the  
 patient's name.  
 
1. Part one is received fresh, labeled 'left upper lobe wedge  
resection, r/o carcinoma'. It consists of a wedge shaped portion of  
lung, measuring 9 x 4 x 4 cm. The specimen weighs 36 grams. There is  
a staple line identified on the specimen measuring 9 cm and 3 cm in length. The staple line is inked black and the pleural surface is  
inked blue. The pleural surface shows dimpling at one area. Serial  
sectioning of the specimen reveals a gray white firm irregular mass,  
measuring 3.5 x 3.4 x 1.8 cm. The mass is 1 cm away from the s taple  
line. The mass has a gray white cut surface. The remainder of the  
lung has tan pink spongy parenchyma. One piece cut from the mass is  
submitted for intraoperative microscopic examination. Representative  
sections are submitted.  
 2. Part two is received in formalin, labeled 'station #9 lymph  
node'. It consists of a single piece of tan maroon irregular soft  
tissue, measuring 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm. The specimen is bisected and  
entirely submitted.  
 3. Part three is received in formalin, labeled 'station #11 l ymph  
node'. It consists of a single piece of tan maroon irregular soft  
tissue consistent with lymph node, measuring 1.5 x 0.9 x 0.2 cm. The  
specimen is bisected and entirely submitted for microscopic  
examination.  
 4. Part four is labeled 'upper lobe completion lobectomy'. It  
consists of a lobe of lung measuring 15 x 8 x 4 cm. The specimen 
weighs 169 grams. There are two staple lines identified on the  
specimen, measuring 15 cm and 8 cm in length. The staple line is  
inked black. The bronchus measures 2.5 cm in diameter and the  
bronchial vessels measures 2.0 cm in diameter. The bronchial  
vascular margin is shaved. Serial sectioning of the specimen shows  
tan maroon spongy parenchyma. No definite mass lesion or fibrosis is  
identified. Representative sections are submitted for microscopic  
examination.

  MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY  
 KRAS MUT ATION ANALYSIS  
 
Specimen #
Body Site: Left upper lobe of lung  
Specimen Type: Slides  
Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma  
 RESULTS: Wild -type gene.  
 INTERPRETATION:  
No mutations were identified at codons 12 and 13 of the KRAS gene.  
 COMMENT:  
Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to be associated with poor  
prognosis, and resistance to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor  
therapies in patients with non- small- cell lung cancer (NSCLC). KRAS  
mutations occur in 15- 30% of NSCLC patients and are strongly 
associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking history.  
 This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;  
based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are  
expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of  
the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low  
percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated  
for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and codon 13 mutations in  
fresh, frozen, or formalin- fixed paraffin embedded tissue. In  
particular the test performance has been established in samples of  
colorectal cancer and non- small cell lung carcinoma which harbor  
these mutations, although several other tissues are also known to  
harbor KRAS mutations (e.g.  tumors of pancreas, bile duct, ovary,  
appendix, etc.).  
 Analysis of EGFR mutation or gene amplification status may provide  
additional information regarding this patient's probability of  
 response to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies, if  
clinical ly indicated. See references.  
 
 
METHOD/LIMITATIONS:  
Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is  
selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified  
and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to 
exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single  
nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;  
primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel  
electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or  
nega tive results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants  
or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

ADDENDUM #3:  
  EGFR Mutation Analysis  
 
 
 Body Site: Left upper lobe of lung  
 Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma  
 RESULTS: No mutation detected  
 
INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified; however 18- 20% of  
patients with non- small- cell lung cancer and without identifiable  
mutations are reported to be responsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase  
inhibitor therapies.  
  
COMMENT: This assay analyzes exons 18- 21 of the EGFR tyrosine  
kinase domain; based on the current literature, the vast majority of  
mutations are expected to occur in these exons. The analytical  
sensitivity of the assay is 10- 20%, thus mutations present in a low  
percentage of cells may not be detected.  
 Most data published to date pertain to gefitinib (Iressa(r)).  
Similar data have been seen in studies using erlotinib (Tarceva(r)).  
 
Homozygosity for the frequently occurring sequence change 2361 G>A  
was identified. The polymorphism is not likely to have clinical  
significance.  
 
This test is validated for non- small cell lung carcinoma. The 
clinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types  
is unknown.  
 METHOD/LIMITATION: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is  
selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the samples, quantified  
 and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to 
exons 18- 21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by  
bi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary electrophoresis  
and fluorescence detection. False positive or negative results may  
occur for reasons that include genetic variants or somatic  
heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

 FINDINGS: FISH was performed on paraffin embedded tissue sections  
using dual color break -apart probe ) to the  
gene at 2p23. this probe flanks the entire gene. If a rearrangement  
involving ALK is present, inversion or translocation, one of the two  
probe signals separates as one red (orange) and one green signal. In  
this specimen, separated signals were present in 0% of the nuclei  
scored. Based on laboratory validation data, these results are  
within the normal limits.

MACROSCOPIC 
Nine specimens received. 
I: The specimen is labelled ""R uppcr lobe"" and consists of an upper lobe measuring 190 x 85 x 45 
mm. Just superior and lateral to the main bronchus is a nImour which, on the external surface, 
measures approximately 38 rom in diameter. On sectioning the nImour measures 28 mm. Distal to this 
there is bronchiectasis and some endogenous lipid pneumonia. Adjacent 10 the mass there appears to 
be an adherent involved lymph node. Sectioning of the lung tissue away from Ihe tumour reveals no 
other lesions. A longue of tumour protrudes into the main bronchus but invasive tumour appears to be 
clcar by at least 5 mm. [Bronchus and peribronchial lymph nodes, A; tumour, B-C; adherent 
apparently involved lymph node, D; tongue of tumour and adjacent bronchus, E; lung tissue distal to 
the tumour, F; random section of lung, G]. 
2: The specimen is labelled ""right middle lobe lymph node"" and consists ofa fragment of grey-black 
tissue measuring 23 x 23 x 5 mm. [[Wrapped and blocked in tOIO, 2A]. 
3: The specimen is labelled ""right upper lobe lymph node"" and consists of two pieces of lymph node 
tissue, one of which measures 25 x 12 x 8 mm, and the other measures 7 mm in maximal dimension. 
[The largest piece bisected and all wrapped and BIT, 3AJ. 
4: The specimen is labelled ""No.7 lymph node"" and consists of three pieces oflymph node tissue 
measuring 35 x 25 x 6 nun in aggregate. [BIT,4A]. 
5: The specimen is labelled ""No.8 lymph node"" and consists of pieces of lymph node measuring 32 x 
20 x 5 nun. [Wrapped and blocked in toto, 5A]. 
6: The specimen is labelled ""No.9 lymph node"" and consists of a piece of lymph node measuring 13 x 
6 x 3 nun. (BIT,6A). 
7: The specimen is labelled ""azygous"" and consists ofa piece of blackened lymph node measuring 13 
x 8 x 7 mm. [BIT as lTS, 7A). 
8: The specimen is labelled ""right main bronchus"" and consists of a piece of lymph node measuring 18 
x 13 x 10 mm. There is no apparent adherent bronchus. On sectioning the node has a sclerotic 
appearance and has white and yellow flecks. [BIT as 3TS, 8A]. 
9: The specimen is labelled ""right bronchial stump"" and consists ofa segment of bronchus with a 
staples measuring 23 x 10 x 5 mrn. [Blocked as 2TS .away from the staple line, 9Al 
MICROSCOPY 
I: Sections show a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. There is prominent endobronchial 
component. In situ squamous cell carcinoma extends to the bronchial resection margin but the margin 
appears clear of invasive tumour. In one area, the overlying pleura appears thickened and scarred. 
There are fcatures suspicious for pleural invasion within this area and special stains will be perfonned 
to assess this. The tumour is not present on the pleural surface. No blood vessel, lymphatic or 
perineura l invasion is seen. The tumour appears to directly invade a pcribronchiallymph node. The 
adjacent lung shows no significant changes. 
2: Sections of the lymph nodes show reactive changes only. There is no evidence of malignancy. 
3: Sections of the lymph nodes show reactive changes only. There is no evidence of malignancy. 
4: Sections of the lymph nodes show reactive changes only. There is no evidence of malignancy. 
5: Sections of the lymph nodes show reactive changes only. There is no evidence of malignancy.  6: Sections of the lymph nodes show reactive changes only. There is no evidence of malignancy. 
7: Sections of the lymph nodes show reactive changes and a small silicotic nodule. There is no 
evidence of malignancy. 
8: Sections show squamous cell carcinoma, which is surrounde d by a dense fibrous capsule. Some 
lymphoid aggregates present in this region and it is presumed that this deposit of squamous cell 
carcinoma is present within a lymph node. An adjacent smaller lymph node is present and this shows 
reactive changes only. No bronchial wall is present for assessmenl. Tumour extends ex.tremely closely 
to the diathennicd resection margin. 
9: Sections of the bronchus show a small amount of residual squamous cell carcinoma in SifU. No 
invasive carcinoma is seen. 
SUMMARY 
Right upper lobe and hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes: 
I: Poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma; 28 mm in maximal dimension. 
2; No blood vessel, lymphatic or perineural invasion present.

1: The specimen is labelled ` left upper lobe' and consists of a lobectomy
specimen measuring In its partially Inflated state 210 x 150 x 50 mm. Two
separate bronchi are seen at the hilum ranging In size from 10 to 12. mm In
diameter (lying approximately 30 mm apart), Surrounding the two bronchi is a
bare. area measuring 55 mm in maximal diameter. A staple line Is seen radiating
from the hilar to the periphery, it measures 80 mm In length. Differential
inking Is. as follows ,the bare area Is inked black and the staple line is
removed and Inked blue. The pleural surface Is tan to grey with a diffuse area
of Induration over the lateral lower aspect of the lobe extending over the
lingular, which measures 60 mm in greatest dimension. There Is also scarring
over the apex measuring 15. mm In greatest dimension. The cut surface of the
lung shows a centrally based/pert-bronchial tumour measuring 35 mm In greatest
dimension. It extends peripherally to focally abut the pleural surface
(posterior lateral). Definite macroscopic invasion of the pleura is not seen.
The tumour has a white firm cut surface with focal areas of necrosis. It Iles
10 mm from the closest bronchial margin. A second firm tan nodule measuring 6
mm in greatest. dimension in the apical portion of the lobe. It Iles 2 mm from
the pleural surface (appears to abut the pleural surface) and over 70 mm to the
bronchial margin and 65 mm from the main tumour mass. There is normal
intervening lung. The residual lung shows moderate to. severe emphysema and an
area of pleurally based fibrosis adjacent to the induration over the
lingular/lateral surface. (1A, bronchial margin; 18, hilar lymph nodes; 1C-D,

is clear of the bronchial resection margin .Within the confines of the tumour
there is focal vascular and lymphatic invasion .No perineural permeation by
tumour Is seen .Peribronchial lymph nodes show reactive changes with sinus
histiocytosis ,carbon pigment deposition and scattered flecks of birefringent
material in keeping with silicate .No tumour is identified within these nodes.
Immediately adjacent to the tumour there is focal change within lung parenchyma
in keeping with obstructive pneumonitis characterised by focal organising
pneumonia, mild acute alveolitis, and a few collections of intra -alveolar foamy
macrophages .Marked emphysema is present. Associated with a mixed dust macule
there is a small non -necrotising granuloma. The separately described
macroscopic lesions represent foci of scarring and organising pneumonia. No
tumour is identified within these areas.

MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received in saline , in five parts, each labeled with
the patient 's name.
1.Part one is received fresh, labeled 'lung, right upper lobe wedge
'.It consists of one lung wedge resection specimen measuring 10 x
5.5 x 2 .3 cm. There is a focal area of indurated pleura overlying a
mass .The pleural surface is inked black .The stapled line is
removed and the underlying pleura and parenchyma is inked green.
The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a poorly circumscribed
heterogeneous tan mass measuring 2.5 x 2 .3 x 1.7 cm at a distance of
0.5 cm from the surgical margin and abutting the pleura. A
representative section is frozen for intraoperative evaluation.
Representative sections submitted , IA-U.
2. Part two is received in saline, labeled ' level 7 lymph node
right'. It consists of one piece of anthracotic soft tissue
measuring 1.5 x 1.2 x 0.5 cm. Entirely submitted, 2A.
3. Part three is received in saline, labeled 'level 10 lymph node,
right'. It consists of multiple pieces of anthracotic soft tissue
measuring 1.5 x 1 x 0.7 cm in aggregate, ranging in size from 0.4 cm
to 1 cm in greatest dimension. The largest lymph node is bisected.
Entirely submitted, 3A-3B.
4. Part four is received in saline, labeled' completion right upper
lobectomy'. It consists of one lobectomy specimen measuring 13.5 x
8 x 3.5 cm. The pleura is soft with a bluish-purple color and focal
areas of hemorrhage. There is a stapled line running along the
hilar aspect longitudinally measuring 12 cm in length. This line is
inked green. On the opposite aspect of the specimen there is another
staple line measuring 11 cm in length that is inked black. The
bronchial and vascular stapled margins are removed and shaved sections are submitted. Multiple lymph nodes are dissected from the
hilar region, the largest measuring 0.7 cm in greatest dimension.
The specimen is serially sectioned and no abnormalities are found.
Representative sections submitted 4A-4F.
5. Part five is received in saline , labeled 'level 4 lymph node
right'. It consists of two pieces of yellow fatty tissue measuring
0.8 x 0.6 x 0.2 cm and 0.9 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm. Each piece contains one
black nodule measuring 0.2 cm. Entirely submitted, 5A.

ADDENDUM 3:

MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY
KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS
RESULTS: Positive for a p.G12C (c.34G> T) mutation in codon 12 of the KRAS gene.
INTERPRETATION: Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to
correlate with poor prognosis and resistance to tyrosine kinase
inhibitor therapies in patients with non-small lung cancer.
COMMENT:
KRAS mutations occur in 15-30% of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
patients and are strongly associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking
history.
This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;
based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are
expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of
the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low
percentage of cells may not be detected.
This test is validated for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and
codon 13 mutations in fresh, frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin
embedded tissue. In particular the test performance has been
established in samples of colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung
carcinoma which harbor these mutations, although several other
tissues are also known to harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of
pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix, etc.).
METHOD/LIMITATION:
Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is
selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified
and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to
exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single
nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;
primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel
electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or
negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants
or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

ADDENDUM # 4:
EGFR Mutation Analysis
Referring Physician:
Body Site: Right upper lobe of lung
Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma, mucinous type
RESULTS: No mutation detected.
INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified in the sample provided
for analysis .Fewer than 5% of non-small cell lung carcinoma
patients without identifiable mutations are reported to be
responsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies.
COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more tumor cellularity is optimal
for this mutation analysis .The sample submitted showed 80% tumor cellularity upon pathologist review.
A frequently occurring sequence change 2361>GA (Q787Q) was
identified .This polymorphism is known not to have clinical
significance.
Mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with
differential responsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase
inhibitor (TKI) therapies .The objective response rate among
patients with a sensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%.
This assay analyzes exons 18 -21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain;
based on the current literature ,most mutations in non-small-cell
lung carcinoma (NSCLC) are expected to occur in these exons.
Mutations present in less than 10-20% of extracted DNA may not be
detected by this method .Mutation status in a sample may change
during tumor progression or the course of therapy; therefore, this
result cannot be used to infer the presence or absence of a mutation
in another sample or sub-sample obtained from this tumor.
This testis validated for non- small cell lung carcinoma. The
clinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types
is unknown.
METHOD:
Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is
selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified
and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to
exons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by
bi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary gel
electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or
negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants
or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

Gross Description:
A. Received in formalin is a specimen labeled ""left lung"". The specimen consists of a lung
measuring 15 x 10 x 7.5 cm, tightly adhered pericardium measuring 10 x 8.5 x 0.5 cm and diaphragm
measuring 4.5 x 2 x 0.2 cm. The specimen weighs 606 grams. The bronchial remnant measures 2.4
cm in length and 1.4 cm in diameter. The pericardium is inked green, the diaphragm margin is inked
black, the mediastinal soft tissue margin and perihilar pleural surface is inked blue. The pleura is
incomplete on the lateral aspect of the lung on both the upper and lower lobes (orange ink). The
diaphragmatic surface of the lung is also incomplete with an open defect showing a visibly necrotic
cavity within the lower lobe of the lung. No areas of puckering are present along the pleural surface.
The specimen is sectioned in a transverse plane to reveal a firm, gray-white mass with central necrosis
measuring 8 x 7 x 6 cm. The necrosis is more prominent in the most inferior aspect of the lung. The
greatest dimension of the mass is in the cranial caudal plane. The mass is present from the hilar region
and extends inferior through the lower lobe to the diaphragmatic aspect. The lung parenchyma adjacent
to the mass is soft and tan-orange. The upper and lower lobes are firmly adhered at the oblique fissure
in the area of the mass showing possible involvement in the upper lobe (section A14). The mass does
involve the bronchus and extending within 1.5 cm from the bronchial margin .The mass grossly abuts
the diaphragm margin (black inked), the medial pleural surface at the level surrounding the hilum (blue
inked) and the lateral pleural defect (inked orange). The mass comes within 0.3 cm of the mediastinal
tissue margin (blue inked) and within 0.5 cm of the pericardial margin ( green inked). The vessels at the
hilar level appear to be grossly involved. Mucous plugs are identified diffusely throughout the bronchi.
The mucous plugs are prominent within the posterior aspect of the upper and lower lobe bronchioles
ranging in size from 0.1 to 0.2 cm. The upper lobe lung parenchyma appears grossly unremarkable and
is smooth, red and spongy. No intraparenchymal lymph nodes are identified. Peribronchial lymph
nodes are identified and range in size from 0.3 to 1.3 cm. Perihilar lymph nodes are identified and
range in size from 0.9 to 1.6 cm. Representative sections are submitted as follows: A2 - vascular
shave margin; A3 -A5 - mass in relationship to diaphragm; A6 - mass in relationship to mediastinal soft
tissue margin; A7 and A8 - mass in relationship to pericardial margin; A9 - mass in relationship to
bronchus and pleura; A10 through A13 - mass in relationship to pleural margin; A14 - mass at lung
fissure ;A15 - mass in relationship to hilar vasculature; A16 - mass in relationship to lateral pleural
defect; All and Al 8 - additional sections of mass non-marginal; Al 9 and A20 - sections of upper lobe
posterior aspect with mucus plugs; A21 - section of upper lobe anterior aspect; A22 - section of upper
lobe middle aspect; A23 - section of apex; A24 - perihilar lymph nodes; A25- A26 - peribronchial lymph

Lung,Left,Squamous cell carcinoma,T2 N0,,,TCGA-77-7463.pdf,"LEFT UPPER LOBECTOMY 
Clinical Details: 
FNA: Squamous cell carcinoma. 
Macroscopy: 
The specimen weighs 180 g and comprises a lobe oflung with appearances in keeping with left upper 
lobe. Within the superior lingular segment there is a tumour nodule measuring 30 x 28 x 25 mm. It is 
situated at a distance of25 rrun from the bronchial resection margin. The tumour has caused puckering 
of the overlying pleura. No pleural surface Involvement is seen macroscopically. Inferior to this 
nodule, at a distance of20 mm, there is a hard circumscribed fibrous nodule showing central caseation, 
measuring 14 mrn in maximum diameter. Within the anterior segment there is a subpleural dark grey 
nodule measuring 6 mrn in maximum diameter. The lung parenchyma otherwise appears normal. [A, 
bronchial resection margin to lingular segment; B, bronchial resection margin to anterior and apico­
posterior segments; C, lymph nodes at resection margin; D, small subpleural nodule anterior segment; 
E, apex; F, anterior segment; G, nodule lingular segment; H-K,. RS of tumour including pleura in each 
section (note: an endobronchial origin is not identified macroscopically)). 
Microscopy: 
Sections show a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma which abuts but does not directly 
invade the plewa. However there is lymphatic permeation which does involve pleural lymphatics. No 
vascular invasion is identified . Peribronchial lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy. The 
subpleural nodule in the anterior segment is shown to represent a silicotic nodule. The larger nodule in 
the lingular segment has a similar histological appearance but shows extensive central necrosis. 
Special stains will be performed to exclude superimposed infection. 
Conclusion: 
Left upper lobectomy: 
Moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, 30 mm in diameter. 
Lymphatic invasion present, involving pleura. 
No vascular invasion is seen 
No lymph node metastasis present.
