Extending from the renal pelvis is a ureter (8 x 0.5 cm) renal artery measuring 7x\n0.5 cm, and rend vein measuring 0.5 x 1 cm. The renal vein is free of gross abnormality at the margin. The specimen\nis received with a surface disruption at the inferior pole and at the lateral aspect of the kidney measuring 6 cm in\ngreatest dimension through which friable necrotic debris extrudes. The adjacent fat is marked with black ink. In the\nmid lower pole and corresponding to the capsular disruption is a well circumscribed predominantly necrotic mass\nmeasuring 15 x 10 x 9 cm. The mass lies 1 cm from the renal vein margin and grossly extends through the renal Page 2 of 2\ncapsule and perirenal fat at the capsular disruption site. The remainder of the renal cortex is tan-brown with a well\ndefined corticomedullaryjunction. The pelvis and calyces are covered by smooth glistenin mucosa .The adipose\ntissue is thinly sectioned, and no lymph nodes are found .The case is reviewed by , Representative sections\nof the specimen are submitted as follows :Al) renal vein, artery and ureter margins en face ;A2-3) capsular\ndisruption two fragments per cassette ;A4-8) capsule wall, two fragments per cassette ;A9) non- neoplastic kidney;\nAl 0) perinephritic fat.\nAt the request oM the specimen is regrossed with additional sections of the perlhilar blood vessels\nsubmitted in cassettes Al 1-A15 under the direction ot^ ^s\nMICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:\nSections of vascular and ureteral margin tissues do not show a neoplasm .Sections of the grossly described\nlesion show a necrotic papillary carcinoma with patchy hemosiderin, and areas of variably foamy cytoplasm.

Right kidney mass: In formalin labeled \"right kidney mass\" is a 15 x 7.5 x 6.5 cm kidney with abundant attached\nperinephric fat weight 1,721 grams in aggregate. There is 3.5 cm ureter extending from the renal hilum. The kidney is\nbivalved to reveal an ill defined 8.5 cm in greatest dimension variegated tan-white to red nodular tumor within the\nsuperior pole. On cut section, the tumor grossly appears to possibly extend into the perinephric fat at the superior pole.\nThe lining of the renal pelvis is grey-white and slightly bosselated. Upon sectioning it appears that the tumor elevates\nthe urothelium and It is unclear at gross dissection whether the tumor penetrates through the urothelium into the renal\npelvis. The tumor also grossly extends into the renal artery, lying 5mm from the renal artery resection margin. The\nremaining renal parenchyma is pale tan-pink with an ill defined corticomedullary junction. There is a small portion of\nadrenal gland at the most superior aspect of the specimen with an orange red out surface. The gland grossly does not\nappear to be involved by tumor. The perinephric fat is inked black. Representative sections are submitted in eight\ncassettes as labeled: A vascular and ureter margins, B tumor to include perinephric fat, C-D tumor to include renal\npelvis, E tumor to include renal artery, F tumor to include uninvolved renal parenchyma, G normal renal parenchyma, H\nadrenal gland.\n2. Peri-caval node. In formalin labeled \"peri-caval node\" are two nodular tan-pink tissues which measure 3.5 x 3 x 2.3 cm\n3.and 2.5 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm. The larger tissue Is inked blue and the smaller tissue is inked black. Sectioning of the larger\ntissue reveals a slightly friable and partially cystic tan-pink cut surface containing coagulated blood. Sectioning of the\nsmaller tissue reveals a partially cystic red-brown cut surface containing coagulated blood. Representative sections are\nsubmited in 4 cassettes as follows: A-B entire smaller tissue ,C-D larger tissue.\nGallbladder :In formalin labeled \"gallbladder\" is a 9.5 x 5 x 2.8 cm intact gallbladder. The serosa is tan-pink and dull.\nThe cystic duct is 0.3 cm in diameter and patent .The gallbladder wall averages 0.2 cm in thickness. The mucosa is\nvelvety yellow-red with diffuse yellow stippling within the body. The lumen contains tan-yellow viscous bile and a 2.5 cm\ngreen -black granu,tar cholelith.

Trimmed of fat the kidney is 133 gm, 9.3 x 5.8 x 3.8 cm. Arising from the \nrenal pelvis is a 7.8 cm in length and 0.6 em in diameter segment of ureter, a 2.2 cm in length and 1 em in \ndiameter segment of renal artery, and a 1.2 cm in length and 0.8 cm in diameter segment of renal vein. No \nlymph nodes are identified in the renal pelvis and no adrenal gland tissue is identified within the perirenal \nfat. The kidney is purple-brown with a faint lobulated appearance. On the inferior pole there is a 3.5 em in \ndiameter spherical nodule with a yellow-tan coloration. In this area the capsule is inked black. The cut \nsurface identifies a 5.5 x 3.5 x 3.5 cm mottled yellow-tan tumor mass with focal areas of hemorrhagic \nnecrosis and white fibrous areas up to 1.2 cm in maximum diameter. In addition, there are cystic structures \nfrom 0.1 to 1 cm in diameter. Grossly, the tumor mass extends to the renal capsule but does not penetrate \nthe capsule. In addition, the tumor extends into the vein ofthe renal pelvis. The remaining renal \nparenchyma is red-brown. The surface of the cortex exhibits broad-based scars up to 1.6 cm in diameter. \nIn addition, there are renal retention cysts from 0.2 to 0.8 cm. The renal cortex averages 0.5 cm in \nthickness and the medulla averages 1.2 cm. No other masses or indurated areas are grossly identified. \nSummary of sections: 1 -surgical margins of the ureter, renal artery and renal vein, 2-4 -tumor mass and \nrenal capsule, 5-6 -tumor mass and renal pelvis, 7 -representative section of renal parenchyma with scar, \n8 -representative section of renal parenchyma with renal retention cysts, 9-11 tumor within segmental \nbranches of renal vein. \nMicroscopic Description \nMicroscopic examination has been performed on all slides.

(FINAL) Patient:\nCase #:\nFINAL SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT\nRenal mass\nGross Description:\nThe specimen is labeled left kidney and is received in formalin. It consists of a nephrectomy specimen\nwhich together with perinephric fat weighs 446 grams. It measures 17.5 cm from superior to inferior, 9 cm\nfrom medial to lateral, and 4.5 cm from anterior to posterior. Along the medial-superior edge of the\nperinephric fat there is a intact appearing 6.5 x 3.5 x 1 cm portion of adrenal gland. Along the anterior\nsurface of the kidney there Is a thin delicate membranous tissue consistent with Gerota 's fascia\napproximately measuring 10 x 5 cm. The central-lateral surface of the nephrectomy specimen is torn and\ndisrupted exposing the cortical surface of the kidney which Is bulging .Serial sections of the adrenal gland\nreveal no gross evidence of tumor involvement. At the hilum of the kidney the renal artery and renal vein\nare identified. The vessels are opened and there is no gross evidence of intraluminal tumor. Extending\nfrom the hilum of the kidney is a small caliber portion of ureter which is 6.5 cm in length and 0.3 cm In\ndiameter. The ureter is opened to the renal pelvis to reveal the urothelium Is tan-white and smooth and\nunremarkable. Sectioning through the central-lateral surface of the kidney reveals a well circumscribed\ngolden yellow and thinly capsulated appearing neoplasm which overall measures 3.3 x 3.2 x 2.8 cm. This\nneoplasm abuts the cortical surface of the kidney but grossly does not appear to extend through the renal\ncapsule Into the small amount of adherent perirenal adipose tissue .The neoplasm Is 3.5 cm from the\nhilum and hilar vascuiature. There is some cautery and cavitation of the renal parenchyma just along the\nsuperior edge of the tumor suggestive of surgical manipulation .There is some hemorrhage extending\ninto the hilar fat. The kidney away from the neoplasm has a normal reddish brown appearance and the\ncortical medullary junction appears distinct. The cortical thickness is 0.7 cm. Close sectioning of the\nremainder of the kidney reveals no additional masses. The perinephric adipose tissue is dissected but no\nlymph nodes are identified grossly. Also in the specimen container is an additional 7.5 cm aggregate of\nlobulated fatty tissue which is serially sectioned and palpably unremarkable. Representative sections of\nthe tumor are obtained for research purposes. Following fixation the sections are submitted as\nsummarized below: Section summary: Al) surgical margin, renal artery, renal vein and ureter, A2)\nadrenal gland, A3) additional sections of ureter and ureteral pelvic junction, A4) Gerota's fascia, A5-A7)\nsections of central-lateral tumor and cortical surface of kidney, A7-A8) sections of tumor and immediately\nadjacent renal tissue. Additional section of tumor adjacent to the renal sinus was submitted in Al 0, and\nan additional section of renal artery and renal vein are submitted in cassette Al 1.^\nMicroscopic Description:\nMicroscopic sections have been examined.
