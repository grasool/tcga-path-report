sectioned and individually submitted labeled A-8. Remaining tissue 
fragments are submitted labeled C. 
Container labeled -left upper lobe"" has a 
. -. e_ .. l' - previously partially ctioned portion of 
recognizable pulmonary parenchyma grossly consistent with left upper 
lobe of lung. The specimen as received weighs 126 grams and measures 
16.7 x 9.5 x 2.9 cm. The margin of resection is bifurcation of the 
tertiary bronchi with an adjacent 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.7 cm fleshy 
gray-black nodule. The pleura is slightly wrinkled gray-pink and 
moderately anthracotic streaked. On the posterior aspect of the mid 
region is a partially sectioned previously inked 3.5 x 3.2 cm area 
of umbilicated induration . The specimen is partially sectioned in 
of 3 
 this region to reveal an underlying 3.5 x 2.9 x up to 1.6 cm 
somewhat fleshy focally gritty gray-tan fibrotic lesion which 
extends to but does not grossly appear to extend through the pleura. 
This is seen at its nearest point 2.3 cm from the nearest bronchial 
margin. An apparent bronchial connection is identified . On 
sectioning , the remaining parenchyma reveals spongy congested 
parenchyma with minimal anthracotiC streaking . No additional gross 
lesions are identified . Also received in the same container are two 
tissue cassettes . The first is a red cassette labeled "" and 
the second is a gray cassette labeled ""good"". Representative 
sections of the tissue are submitted labeled as follows: A -shaved

Comments 
Sections of the tumor show a well differentiated mucinous 
adenocarcinoma . Focally, in one residual bronchus , an area of in 
situ adenocarcinoma is identified. In addition , some subpleural 
fibrosis is present suggesting that this is a primary adenocarcinoma 
as opposed to a metastatic adenocarcinoma. A panel of 
immunohistochemical stains is performed including CK7, CK20, CDX2, 
and TTF1 (with appropriate positive and negative controls). The 
neoplastic cells are strongly positive for CK7. The neoplastic 
cells demonstrate some scattered focal positive stain for CK20. The 
neoplastic cells demonstrate focal weakly positive staining TTF1. 
In addition, the neoplastic cells demonstrate a rare focal positive 
staining cell for CDX2. 
This demonstrates a well differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma. 
The subpleural fibrosis would suggest this represents a primary lung 
neoplasm, however, the immunohistochemical stains are equivocal and 
therefore the possibility of a metastatic lesion cannot be fully 
excluded on histologic grounds alone. Clinical correlation and 
follow up is recommended.

MICROSCOPIC 
A) Sections through the wedge resection from the left upper lobe confirm 
the presence of non-small cell carcinoma. The tumor is predominantly 
composed of solid nests of cells with large vesicular nuclei and abundant 
eosinophilic cytoplasm. Mitotic activity is fairly abundant and areas of 
tumor necrosis are seen. The tumor is predominantly growing in solid nests 
with minimal acinar formation. although occasional foci of both 
intracellular and extracellular mucin are suggested. This lesion abuts but 
does not appear to specifically infiltrate within the overlying visceral 
pleura Assessment in this regard includes an elastic stain on block A6. 
Noninvolved pulmonary parenchyma demonstrates nonspecific emphysematous 
changes but is otherwise unremarkable. A limited immunohistochemical 
evaluation of this lesion is performed with results as follows:  TTF -1: Positive 
_in A: Negative 
Negative 
P63: Limited/focal positivity is seen 
The combination of TTF-1 positivity with apparent focal mucin production by 
this neoplasm would confirm a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. 
B-G) The microscopic appearance substantiates the diagnosis.

Breast,,Invasive carcinoma of no special type (NST) without specific differentiation,T2 N0 Mx,II or III,Malignant,ER-ADRU.pdf,                       ," Report: 
The sample consists of a fragment of neoplastic tissue measuring 3.5 x 2.2 x 1.8 cm. The tumor is composed of nests and cords of relatively uniform cells with moderate amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm and round to oval nuclei containing fine chromatin and inconspicuous nucleoli. The mitotic activity is brisk, approximately 12 mitoses per 10 high power fields. There is focal necrosis present. The tumor shows infiltration into the surrounding fibroadipose tissue. No lymphovascular invasion is identified. Immunohistochemical stains show that the tumor cells are positive for estrogen and progesterone receptors, and negative for HER2/neu. The surgical margins are widely negative.

1. Site: Breast - The report mentions ""a fragment of neoplastic tissue"" but does not provide explicit information about the site; however, the context implies that it is a breast tumor due to the description and immunohistochemical stains for estrogen and progesterone receptors, which are typically performed for breast cancer.

2. Laterality: Not provided - The report does not mention whether the tumor is from the left or right breast.

3. Histology: Invasive carcinoma of no special type (NST), also known as invasive ductal carcinoma, without specific differentiation - This diagnosis is based on the description of nests and cords of relatively uniform cells infiltrating the surrounding tissue, along with the absence of features indicative of a specific subtype.

4. Stage: T2 - Based on the size of the tumor (3.5 cm) and the invasion into the surrounding fibroadipose tissue, it can be classified as T2 according to the TNM staging system for breast cancer. N0, Mx - No information is provided about lymph node involvement or distant metastasis in this report; thus, they are classified as N0 (no regional lymph node metastasis) and Mx (metastasis cannot be assessed).

5. Grade: Grade II or III - The report mentions brisk mitotic activity (12 mitoses per 10 high power fields), focal necrosis, and moderate nuclear atypia; however, it does not provide enough information to definitively classify the tumor as either grade II or III.

6. Behavior: Malignant - This is inherent in the diagnosis of invasive carcinoma, which indicates malignant behavior by definition.",,,
Colon,,Adenocarcinoma,T2N0Mx,II,Malignant,CDDP-ABJZ.pdf,," Report:

The examination of this case material and the preparation of this report were  
performed by the staff pathologist.  
 Note:  
Frozen section diagnoses are confirmed.   Mucicarmine, TTF -1, Napsin A, CK 5/6,  
and p63 were performed on block D4 in conjunction with appropriately reacting  
controls to assess for  glandular and squamous differentiation.   Mucicarmine does  
not show any intracytoplasmic positivity.   The immunohistochemical staining  
results show the tumor cells are diffusely and strongly positive for CK5/6 and  
p63, while negative for TTF -1 and Napsin A . These staining results in  
conjunction with the light microscopic features are consistent with a diagnosis  
of squamous cell carcinoma.

MACROSCOPIC
One specimen received.
The specimen is labelled `L wedge resection lingula' and consists of a wedge
resection of lung measuring in its partially Inflated state 115 x 90 x 35 mm.
A staple line is present at the proximal margin measuring 85 mm in length. The
pleural surface contains two separate ragged/indurated areas .The largest
measures 35 x 25 mm and Is roughened. The second smaller area measures 17 mm
in greatest dimension and has a punched out full thickness defect in the
pleura. The pleura surrounding these roughened areas shows diffuse thickening.
The cut surface shows a pleural-based. peripheral tumour. It has an ill-defined
outline with prominent adjacent collapse and consolidation. The tumour
measures approximately 35 x 31 x 19 mm. It appears to directly Involve the two
disrupted pleural surfaces described previously. The tumour lies. 15 mm from
the nearest surgical resection margin. The cut surface of the rest of the lung
parenchyma shows extensive obstructive changes. There are small firm nodules
within this ranging In size from 1 to 5 mm In. greatest dimension. They may
represent separate tumour foci. There Is also mild emphysema. [1A-1B, tumour
including resection margin ;1C-ID, RS tumour adjacent to smaller full thickness
pleural defect; 1E, RS tumour adjacent to intact pleura next to small defect;
1F, RS tumour adjacent to larger full thickness pleural defect; 1G, RS possible
separate tumour foci within consolidation; 1H, RS relatively normal lung.]
MICROSCOPIC
Sections show a moderately differentiated keratinising squamous cell carcinoma.
it shows areas of necrosis and is associated with a florid Inflammatory
response. Invasion of the visceral pleura is confirmed and carcinoma is
present on the inked surface of the disrupted pleura. The stapled. surgical
resection margin is well clear of malignancy. Tumour surrounds and compresses
a number of blood vessels, and there is focal vascular invasion. No lymphatic
or perineural invasion is identified. The surrounding lung is confirmed to
show organising obstructive pneumonitis. The nodules noted macroscopically
appear to represent foci of bronchiectasis, organising pneumonia and localised
subpleural honeycomb change. No tumour is identified within these areas.
There is interstitial fibrosis in these areas and there are a few foci of
fibroblastic proliferation reminiscent of the fibroblastic foci of UIP; however
the section of normal appearing lung shows only emphysema with no features to
suggest an established interstitial pneumonitis. No lymph nodes are included.
SUMMARY
Lingulectomy:
Moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, 35 mm in diameter.
Pleural Invasion present with disruption and tumour on pleural surface. Vascular invasion present.
No lymphatic or perineural invasion identified.
No lymph nodes included.

HISTORY
Lobectomy for carcinoma.
MACROSCOPIC
Six specimens are received.17113
1: The first specimen Is labelled ""R middle lobe, R lower lobe, R upper lobe""
and consists of right middle and lower lobes with a small stapled wedge of
upper lobe superiorly. The specimen measures 165 x 75 x 45 mm with the stapled
wedge of upper lobe measuring 70 x 30 x 30 mm. There is a firm mass with
overlying pleural adhesions at the apical aspect of the lower lobe, measuring
52 x 50 x 35 mm. On sectioning, the mass has a pale sclerotic appearance and
is centrally cavitated. The cavity measures 12 mm across. The tumour extends
to apparently Involve the lateral pleural surface and It extends close to the
pleura on the medial aspect. In this region it extends into a bronchus. There
is possible involvement of the upper lobe but the tumour appears well clear of
the stapled upper lobe resection margin. No other focal lesions are identified
on sectioning and there are no other endobronchial lesions. [Bronchial and
vascular resection margin, 1A; peribronchial lymph nodes, 1B; tumour with
overlying pleura, 1C-1E; tumour and upper lobe resection margin, IF; tumour and
medial surface of lung, 1G; further section, 11-1; tumour and proximal bronchus,
1I; random section of lung, 13.]
2: The second specimen Is labelled ""upper lobe lymph node ""and consists of two
pieces of lymph node ,17 x 15 x 7 mm and 15 x 11 x 8 mm .[Each piece bisected
and blocked in toto, 2A]
3: The third specimen is labelled ""No. 11 lymph node"" and consists of three
pieces of tissue measuring 18 x 15 x 8 mm in aggregate. [Largest: piece
bisected and all tissue wrapped and blocked in toto, 3A]
4: The Fourth specimen is labelled ""No. 7 lymph node"" and consists o fpieces of
fatty tissue measuring 45 x 30 x 15 mm in aggregate .[BIT, 4A-46]
5: The fifth specimen Is labelled ""No. 8 lymph node"" and consists of a piece of
lymph node measuring 18 x 10 x 6 mm. [Bisected and BIT]
6: The sixth specimen is labelled No. 9 lymph node ""and consists of lymph node
with surrounding fat measuring 35 x 16 x 8 mm. [Bisected and BIT]
MICROSCOPIC
1: Sections show a poorly differentiated squarnous cell carcinoma with central
cavitation. The cavitation appears to be due, at least in part, to vascular
invasion by tumour which is present at multiple sites throughout the sections.
Tumour Invades into overlying parietal pleura but appears clear of the soft(7//A16,cs, S7O/3

tissue resection margin. No lymphatic invasion is seen, and peribronchial
lymph nodes show no evidence of metastatic carcinoma. The upper lobe resection
margin is well clear of malignancy. Proximally the tumour has a protruding
endobronchiat component but no in situ squamous carcinoma is found, and the
bronchial resection margin is clear of malignancy. Focal perineural invasion
is found towards the hilum. Lung parenchyma adjacent to the tumour shows
organising pneumonia, while more distant lung parenchyma is unremarkable.
2:Sections show reactive lymphoid hyperplasia and several silicotic nodules,
but there is no evidence of metastatic carcinoma.
3:Sections show small foci of metastatic squamous cell, carcinoma in one of
the lymph nodes.
4-6: Sections show reactive lymphoid hyperplasia and scattered silicotic
nodules, but there is no evidence of metastatic carcinoma.
SUMMARY
Right middle and lower lobectomy, partial resection of right upper lobe and
lymph node sampling:
Poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of apical segment of right lower
lobe, 52 mm in diameter.
Invasion of parietal pleura present, but soft tissue resection margin clear of
malignancy.

The patient is a 64-year-old woman with a history of left breast mass. A core needle biopsy was performed. The specimen consists of two fragments of tan-pink tissue. The larger fragment measures 0.9 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm and the smaller fragment measures 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm. Microscopic description: The tumor is composed of cells arranged in cords and nests, with focal comedo necrosis. The tumor cells have high nucleus to cytoplasm ratio, vesicular chromatin, and conspicuous nucleoli. Mitotic figures are easily identified. Immunohistochemical stains show the tumor cells to be positive for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2 neu. The background shows extensive lymphocytic infiltration. No ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or invasive carcinoma is identified in the surrounding breast tissue.

1. ""Site"": left breast. Justification: The report mentions a left breast mass and the biopsy was performed on the left breast.
2. ""Laterality"": left. Justification: The tumor is located in the left breast, as stated in the report.
3. ""Histology"": Invasive ductal carcinoma. Justification: The report mentions the tumor cells are arranged in cords and nests with focal comedo necrosis, consistent with invasive ductal carcinoma.

MACROSCOPIC 
Five specimens received: 
I: The frrst specimen is labelled ""left upper lobe"" and consists of a lobe of lung measurin g 155 x 95 x 
58 mm in the fresh state. Below the hilum there is a finn tumour which measures 68 x 65 mm in 
maximal dimension and has a finn sclerotic cut surface. Towards the superior aspect of this there is a 
finn node which is adherent to the medial aspect of the tumour. Further enlarged nodes are present 
surrounding the inferior aspect of the bronchial resection margin and pulmonary artery. The tumour 
abuts the pleural surface on this medial aspect but appears clear of the lateral aspect by approximately 
10 mm. On sectioning there are areas of necrosis and the tumour has a sclerotic cut face. Elsewhere 
there is apical scarring. Distal to the tumour there is evidence of obstructive pneumonitis and in the 
basal aspect of the lung there is a finn grey nodule. The lymph node superior to me tumour measures 
15 mm in diameter while the lymph node inferior to the tumour measures 23 mm in diameter.

2: The second specimen is labelled ""pulmonary artery margin"" and consists ofa segment of vessel 
measuring 7 x 6 x 4 mm. LBIT] 
3: The third specimen is labelled ""L lower lobe node"" and consists of fragments of blackened lymph 
node measuring 16 x 13 x 4 mm in aggregate. [Largest piece bisected and al1 wrapped and blocked in 
toto.] 
4: The fourth specimen is labelJed ''No.5'' and consists of several pieces of lymph node invested in fat 
and measuring 20 x 15 x 14 mm. [Bisected and blocked in toto, 4A] 
5: The fifth specimen is labelled ""lingula L lung"" and consists of[Wo pieces of blackened lymph node, 
and 17 mm in maximal dimension. [Blocked in toto, SA] 
MICROSCOPIC 
I: Sections show a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Patchy necrosis is present. 
Vascular invasion is presenl but the pulmonary artery is clear of malignancy. No pleural, lymphatic or 
perineura l invasion is identified. The bronchial resection margin is clear of malignancy and shows no 
evidence of squamous metaplasia or dysplasia. Obstructive pneumonitis is confinned adjacent to the 
tumour. A way from the tumour there are at least three further distinct lesions. The first is the nodule 
noted in the lower zone which comprises granulomatous inflammation including numerous giant cells 
of Langhans type with surround ing lymphocytic infiltration and fibrosis. A few tiny foci of necrosis 
are present within this nodule. There are [wo further foci of granulomatous inflammation with 
extensive central necrotic debris surrounded by foamy macrophag es and fibrosis. These appear to be 
centred on bronchi. No organisms are identified in any of these lesions with Grocott or ZN stains. 
However the appearances are highly suspicious for infection, and I note that atypical Mycobacteria 
have been found previously in sputum. The peribronchial lymph nodes are confmned to contain 
metastatic squamous cell carcinoma, and they also have foci of fibrosis and dystrophic calcification, 
but they show no evidence of granulomatous inflamma tion. 
2: Sections of the pulmonary artery show no evidence of malignancy . 
3: Sections of the lymph node show multiple silicotic nodules together with extensive sheets of 
pigmented macrophages but there is no evidence of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma. 
4: Sections show lymph nodes with a follicular hyperplasia, sinus histiocytosis and aggregates of 
pigmented macrophages. There is no evidence of malignancy.  5: Sections show fragments oflymph node and surrounding fat. There is no evidence of metastatic 
squamous cell carcinoma. 
SUMMARY

FINAL PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS: 
Lung, right upper lobe, biopsies: 
Adenocarcinoma -see comment. 
COMMENTS: 
Histologic sections show an invasive carcinoma consisting 
primarily of sheets of cells with scattered, discrete 
glandular structures. The neoplastic cells have prominent 
nucleoli, and do not have the cytologic appearance of small 
cell carcinoma, grade II neuroendocrine carcinoma (atypical 
carcinoid) or large cell neuroendocrine carCinoma. 
Immunohistochemical stains are performed. The neoplasm 
stains positively for cytokeratin CK7 as well as forTTF-1. 
The neoplasm is negative for CK20, high molecular weight 
keratin SK and p63. The findings support the diagnosis of .-
_gdenocarcinoma of lung primary. There is weak staining for 
synaptophysin. It 1s felt 1n that this is an example of 
non-neuroendocrine carcinoma {adenocarcinoma) that shows 
positive staining for synaptophysin, and that it should not 
result in classification of a neuroendocrine tumor. 
Current NCCN practice guidelines recommend determination of 
EGFR and KRAS mutation status in adenocarcinoma of lung to 
help select patients for Tyrosine-Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) 
therapy. EGFR-activating mutations have been shown to be 
significantly associated with response to TKis and KRAS 
mutations are associated with TKI resistance. They are 
mutually exclusive in NSCLC. Additionally, recent data show 
that ALK (Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase) gene rearrangements in 
adenocarcinoma of lung are associated with resistance to 
TKis and have favorable response rates to Crizotinib, the 
ALK inhibitor agent currently in clinical trials. Mutation 
analysis for KRAS and EGFR-TK domain and ALK gene 
rearrangement by FISH is available as the Lung Cancer 
Mutation Panel. Testing may be performed on 
paraffin-embedded tissue from the primary or metastatic 
tumor or pleural fluid cell block. These tests are 
available on request as a panel or as individual assavs. 
This case has been reviewed by 
who agree with the diagnosis.

GROSS DESCRIPTION 
A. Received fresh in a container labeled ""right upper 
lobe"" is a 296 gm, 17.8 x 11.8 x 4 em, lung lobe compatible 
with right upper lobe. In the hilar region there is an 0.8 em long 
and 1.5 em in diameter bronchial stump which is grossly 
unremarkable. The vessels at the margin are also grossly 
unremarkable. There are some tan-gray lymph nodes up to 1.2 em in 
greatest dimension in the hilar region. The pleural surface is 
pink-purple with some anthracotic pigment deposition. There .is some 
retraction of the pleural surface. The specimen is sectioned, and 
there is a 2.6 x 2 x 1.8 em rubbery tan-white mass underlying the 
area with pleural retraction1 with the mass suggestive of invading 
the pleura. Approximately 2 em from this mass is a separate 4 x 3.5 
x 3.1 ern rubbery tan-white mass. This mass approaches at least near 
to the pleural surface. The larger lesion has yellow-orange 
discoloration surrounding it, suggestive of surrounding pneumonia. 
The remainder of the parenchyma is spongy and red-purple without 
addi tiona! lesions. RS-13, follmving fixation.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION 
The follm'ling template surrunarizes the findings in this 
case: 
Histologic type: Both of the mass lesions consist of poorly 
differentiated non-small cell carcinoma. There are areas that it is 
favored have squamous differentiation, as well as less frequent 
foci suggestive of glandular differentiation (adenocarcinoma). 
Although not entirely identical, the two lesions look similar. 
Histologic grade: Poorly differentiated 
Primary tumor (pT): These two lesions are grossly 2.6 em and 4 em 
in greatest dimension. The 2.6 em in diameter lesion has visceral 
 pleural invasion, with the larger lesion extending very 
peripherally but without definite visceral pleural invasion. 
Although it is difficult to definitely distinguish between 
synchronous primaries and the two masses being part of the same 
process, given the similarities in appearance, based on the new 
guidelines, two nodules of similar histology in the same lobe 
MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION 
would be classified as pT3, Clinical correlation is recommended. 
Margins of resection: The bronchial and vascular resection margins 
are negative. 
Direct extension of tumor: Visceral pleural extension for the 2.6 
em in diameter lesion, no direct extension identified for the larger 
lesion. 
Vascular invasion: Not definitively identified. 
Regional lymph nodes (pN): pNl. There is metastatic carcinoma in 
one of three hilar lymph nodes in part A. The separately submitted 
lymph nodes in parts B, c, D, and E are negative for malignancy. 
Distant metastasis {pM} : pMX 
Other findings: There are inflammatory changes surrounding the 
tumors, with focally prominent pneumonia surrounding the larger 
lesion. 
Note: This case has been reviewed in Intradepartmental consultation 
with all reviewers interpreting the two mass lesions as similar in 
appearance.

KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS
Referring Physician:
Body Site: Lung
Specimen Type :Slides
Clinical Data :Adenocarcinoma
RESULTS :Positive for a p.G12C (c.34G >T) mutation in codon 12
of the KRAS gene.
INTERPRETATION:
Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to correlate with poor
prognosis and resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies in
patients with non-small -cell lung cancer.
COMMENT:
KRAS mutations occur in 15-30% of non-small -cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients and are strongly associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking
history.
This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;
based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are
expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of
the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low
percentage of cells may not be detected.
This test is validated for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and
codon 13 mutations in fresh, frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin
embedded tissue. In particular the test performance has been
established in samples of colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung
carcinoma which harbor these mutations, although several other
tissues are also known to harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of
pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix, etc.).
METHOD/LIMITATIONS:
Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is
selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample ,quantified
and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to
exon 2 of the KRAS gene .PCR products are subjected to single
nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;
primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel
electrophoresis and fluorescence detection .False positive or
negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants
or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

EGFR Mutation Analysis
Referring Physician: .
Body Site: Lung
Clinical Data :Adenocarcinoma
RESULTS: No mutation detected.
INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified in the sample provided
for analysis .Fewer than 5% of non -small cell lung carcinoma
patients without identifiable mutations are reported to be
responsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies. COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more tumor cellularity is optimal
for this mutation analysis .The sample submitted showed 80% tumor
cellularity upon pathologist review.
A frequently occurring sequence change 2361 G>A (Q787Q) was
identified. This polymorphism is known not to have clinical
significance.
Mutations in the tyrosine domain of the epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with differential
responsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)
therapies. The objective response rate among patients with a
sensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%.
This assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain;
based on the current literature, most mutations in non -small-cell
lung carcinoma (NSCLC) are expected to occur in these exons.
Mutations present in less than 10-20% of extracted DNA may not be
detected by this method. Mutation status in a sample may change
during tumor progression or the course of therapy; therefore, this
result cannot be used to infer the presence or absence of a mutation
in another sample or sub -sample obtained from this tumor.
This test is validated for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The
clinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types
is unknown.
METHOD/LIMITATION:
Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is
selected for analysis .DNA is isolated from the samples, quantified
and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to
exons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by
bi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary gel
electrophoresis and fluorescence detection .False positive or
negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants
or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

Histology: The histological findings include metastatic adenocarcinoma in a lymph node, a primary lung tumor with acinar growth pattern and necrosis, and benign findings in the bone and other lymph nodes.

Stage: Based on the size of the primary lung tumor and the presence of metastasis to a lymph node, the stage is pT1 N2 Mx, indicating that the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes but not to distant organs.

Grade: The grade of the primary lung tumor is moderately differentiated (II).

Behavior: The behavior of the tumor is malignant, as it is a cancer that can invade surrounding tissues and metastasize to other parts of the body.",,,

The specimen consists of a len lung which, in the: inflated state, measures 200 mm in height x 165 x 60 
mm. Fatty and tibrous adhesions are auached to the apex of the: upper lobe where there is a scarred 
area approximately 35 mm in diameter. The pleura is slightly roughened over the mediastinal aspect of 
the upper lobe, approximately 50 mm in ma:-:illluOl dimension, under which a tumour is palpabJe.. Fatly 
tissu-! to a depth of40 mOl is present inferior 10 the bronchial res{""ction margin and this contains 
numerous lymph nodes which are small and black. Numerous large lymph nodes, which measure up to 
35 mOl in maximum dimension. are present superior to the bronchial resection margin. On cut surfaces 
the tumou.r is seen to be 55 mm in maximal dimension. poorly circumscribed, soft and grey and black, 
but with a necrotic centre. It extcnds right up to the pleun.! on the hilar sur£.""\ce of the: lung and also to 
the pleura in the oblique fissure. Tbe tumour appears to be arising from a segmental bronchus. 
probably that of the apicoposterior bronchus of the upper lobe. It is well clear of the bronchial 
re~ction margin. Uninvolved tissue between the tumour and the apex: of the upper lobe is generally 
indurated and that in the ba$lll IIspcct of the lobe is collapsed. Large black lymph nodes arc present 
around major segmcma! bronchi in the lower lobe. No tumour is evident in the lowcr lobe and the 
parenchyma is gencrally normal-appearing lipan from an area approximately 10 mm in maximum 
dimension towards the base which appears fO be an area of haemorrhage. [Lymph nodes inferior to the 
left main bronchus are sampled in IA-ID: those superior to the left main bronchus are sampled in I E­

"," Site: Lung
Justification: The entries in the list specifically mention left lung and mediastinal lymph nodes, indicating the site as the lung.

Laterality: Left
Justification: All the findings point to the left side of the lung, making it the laterality.

Histology: Malignant neoplasm, not otherwise specified (NOS)
Justification: Although specific types like large cell carcinoma and clear cell carcinoma are mentioned, there is no definitive single type given, so NOS is appropriate.

Stage: T2 N1 Mx
Justification: Based on the information provided about tumor size, lymph node involvement, and absence of distant metastasis, this is the correct TNM stage.

Grade: High grade (3)
Justification: The nuclear grade is given as 3, which corresponds to high grade in many systems.

Behavior: Malignant
Justification: This is clear from the context, as the terms carcinoma and malignancy are used throughout the data provided.",,,

ain diagnosis/diagnoses:  
Extensive and locoregionally advanced, central to peripheral, very likely primarily peripheral bronchopulmonary, histologically mixed adenocarcinoma of the right lower lobe of the lung with pleural invasion and metastatic d issemination to both pleural layers and lymph nodes. 
Tumor classification on the basis of this material pT4 pN1 pM1 (P/E) V1 RX, stage IV. C34.3 M 8255/3 G3.  
Comment/supplementary remark:   
Within the main tumor and the lymph node metastases, which are found within the lung in the 
parabronchial region, at the hilus and in sample 5, the large-cell solid tumor component, which has a partly clear -cell character, is predominant. Especially in the area of the main 
tumor margin and the surrounding area the carcinoma shows glandular tubulopapillary and bronchioloalveolar differentiation. No maturation pattern of squamous epithelium is evident on conventional histology (immunohistochemical analysis will follow to provide as definitive confirmation as possible of the bronchopulmonary origin of the tumor and thus exclusion of a late metastatic spread of the reported breast carcinoma). The RX category is explained by the fact that the tumor infiltrating the pleura and disseminated there extends as far as the pleural surface and, with the detection of carcinoma cells in the pleural effusions, the possibility cannot be excluded that some of them remained there. The central bronchus resection line and the resection margins of the large pulmonary vessels and the resection pr eparation of parietal 
pleura itself, as registered under 4., are tumor- free 
  Result of immunohistochemical analysis: a major part of the tumor cells with double expression of low and high molecular weight keratins (M903 and 902). In the glandular differen tiation component, tumor cell nuclei are positive TTF1.  
 The immune profile confirms the diagnosis of an adenocarcinoma of the lung of mixed differentiation.

AILI-J al Investiga11atiire1""Date"," Based on the provided information, here are the answers for the six categories:

Site: The site is the lung, as indicated in the operative information section.

Laterality: The laterality is not explicitly mentioned in the given text, but since there are separate labels for right and left lymph nodes, it can be inferred that the specimens come from both lungs.

Histology: The histology of the mass is not provided in the description, so it cannot be determined with certainty. However, based on the procedures performed (bronchoscopy and thoracoscopy), it could be a lung cancer or another type of lung mass.

Stage: The stage is not provided in the text, as it would require additional information such as the size of the mass and whether it has spread to nearby lymph nodes or other organs.

Grade: The grade is also not provided in the given text. Grade refers to how abnormal the cancer cells look under a microscope and how quickly the cancer is likely to grow and spread.

Behavior: The behavior of the mass cannot be determined without more information, such as whether it is benign or malignant.

Justification for the choices: The site, laterality, stage, grade, and behavior are not explicitly provided in the text, and the histology can only be inferred based on the procedures performed. Therefore, more information is needed to make definitive conclusions about these categories.",,,

GROSS DESCRIPTION 
             A.  Part A is submitted fresh for tissue procurement, 
             labeled ""lingula"".  It consists of an elongated portion of 
    lung tissue, measuring 18 x 4 x 2 cm. maximally.  It has been 
    amputated along an entire edge, which has steel clips and paper tape 
    present.  There is an area of pleural puckering opposite the tape, 
    which has drawn the pleura into a stellate- like area, with a 
    palpable mass deep to that.  The pleura is focally torn along 
    another portion of the specimen.  Black ink is applied over the area 
    of the scar and then the specimen is serially sectioned.  This 
    reveals the presence of a nodular tumor mass immediately beneath the 
    pleura, in the region of the above- mentioned scar.  That tumor mass 
    measures maximally 2 x 1.5 x 1.3 cm.  Sections through the remaining 
    pulmonary parenchyma reveal a consolidated bloody red tissue, 
    without other focal nodules present.  There is some adherent fat 
    present on the pleural surface.  Representative tumor and normal 
    ions are submitted for tissue procurement, per request of 
      Sections after fixation. 
      Part B is submitted fresh, labeled ""Level 10 lymph 
             node"".  It consists of multiple black and red tissue 
    portions.  Three are present, each measuring 6 to 8 mm. in greatest

FINAL DIAGNOSIS
A. (Lung, right upper lobe; wedge resection): Squamous cell carcinoma, grade
2, extending to the visceral pleura and measuring 1.9 cm in greatest
dimension.
No convincing lymphatic permeation seen.
Margins of resection free of tumor.
Stage pT2NOMx
Remaining lung without pathologic changes.
B. (Level 7 lymph node; biopsy): Fragments of lymph nodes negative for
metastatic tumor.
C. (Level 4 lymph node; biopsy): Fragments of lymph nodes negative for
metastatic tumor.
D. (Lung, right upper lobe; wedge resection): Segment of benign lung tissue
with subpleural and interstitial fibrosis and chronic inflammation.Aa INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION
A. FROZEN:WEDGE RESECTION RIGHT UPPER LOBE, DISTANT FROM STAPLE LINE: Suture
line is negative for tumor. Grossly, tumor 0.6cm-0.7 cm from stapled margin.
(A91, A92)
GROSS DESCRIPTION
A. The specimen is labeled frozen, wedge resection right upper lobe.
Received fresh is a 22.0 gram, 8.0 x 3.5 x 1.9 cm wedge of lung with a 9.5 cm
staple margin. The pleura is inked blue and the staple margin is submitted
for frozen section with the remnant placed in cassettes A91 and A92. After
the staple margin is removed, the underlying lung parenchyma is inked orange.
There is a 1.9 x 1.7 x 1.5 cm firm white and black nodule causing pleural
puckering and located approximately 0.6 to 0.7 cm from the staple margin.
Sections are submitted as follows: A91 and A92- staplemargin ;A1- tumor
closest to staple margin, A2 and A3 - tumor closest to pleura; A4 remainder
of tumor; A5 - normal lung away from tumor.
B. The specimen is labeled level 7 lymph node. Received in formalin are
multiple fragments of soft tan tissue measuring in aggregate 1.2 x 0.8 x 0.4
cm. The fragments are wrapped and submitted entirely in cassette B1.
C. The specimen is labeled level 4 lymph node. Received in formalin are
multiple small fragments of soft red and black tissue measuring in aggregate
1.3 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm. The specimen is entirely wrapped and submitted in
cassette C1.
D. The specimen is labeled wedge resection, right upper. Received fresh is a
22 gram, 13 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm segment of lung with a 13 cm and 14 cm staple
margin, which are variably located from 1.1 to 2.1 cm apart. The lung
parenchyma is soft, red and unremarkable. No tumor masses are seen. The
pleura is inked blue and the 13 cm margin is submitted in cassettes D1 and D2,
the 14 cm margin is submitted in cassettes D3 and 04 and two representative
sections of the lung are submitted in cassettes D5 and D6.

E. EML41ALK rearrangement NOT identified (see In Situ Procedure). 
Note: 
KRAS codon 12/13 mutations are found in approximately 10-30% lung adenoyarclnomas and associated with history of 
smoking, The presence of KRAS mutation leads to resistance to EGFR ~ therapies (1). EGFR exon 19 and 21 
mutations are present in about 10% of  and up to 40% in th..-,opulation, common in and 
associated 
with the clinical response to treatment with EGFR inhibitors (2). These mutations are mutually exciusive and 
their presence may have prognostic andlor therapeutic implications (3,4). Clinical studies show high EGFR gene copy 
number by FISH analysis (amplification) to be associated with favorable clinical benefit (clinical response, stable disease, 
time to progression, and survival) In patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase 
inhibitors. 
Approximately 3% of lung adenocarcinomas within the Asian population have an interstitial deletion and inversion in 
chromosome 2p resulting in the EML4IALK fusion gene (ALK+) which is sensitive to AlK inhibitors (5,6). The prevalence 
of this abnormality in the Western population is stili unknown, Detection of this abnormality is critical for identifying 
patients eligible for therapies that target ALK enzymatic activity. EML41ALK rearrangements are mutually exclusive with 
KRAS and EGFR mutations. 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 
SUMMARY STATEMENT 
The posterior segmentectomy demonstrates a 2.5 cm poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma associated with 
angiolymphatic and parietal pleural invasion. Metastatic adenocarcinoma is present in posterior and apical segment 
level 11, level 10 and level 5 lymph nodes. Surgical resection margins are free of tumor. Pathologic stage is T3N2Mx.

MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:  
The specimen is received in three parts, each labeled with the patient's name.  
 1. Part one is received in saline, labeled 'lung, sup erior segment,  
right lower lobe'. It consists of a lobe of the lung measuring 9 x 
 5.5 x 3.5 cm. Two stapled lines are noted measuring 9 cm and 2.5 
cm. The pleura is grey- pink, glistening and mottled lightly with  
fine black streaks. The bronchial margin measures 2 cm and the vascular margin measures 1 cm. Cut surface of the specimen reveals  
a light tan firm nodule measuring 1.5 x 1.4 x 1.2 cm, located 1.5 cm from the overlying pleura and 2 cm from the bronchial resection margin. The remainder of the parenchy ma is pink -red, crepitant  
and blotchy. Representative sections are submitted.  
 2. Part two is received in formalin, labeled '5th rib right'. It consists of a segment of rib measuring 10.5 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm. Scant blood and fibroconnective tissue is attached on the outer surface of bone. The cut surface appears trabeculated and unremarkable.

ain diagnosis/diagnoses:  
Peripheral bronchopulmonary, histologically mixed adenocarcinoma of the middle with pleural invasion and a second small focus or satellite nodule of a tubular adenocarcinoma  with a small bronchiooalveolar growth component and likewise pleural infiltration (sample 2.)). TNM classification on the basis of this material pT2 pN0 pM1 (PUL) V1 RX, stage IV. C34.2 M8255/3.  
Comment/supplementary remark:   
The tumor classification as adenocarcinoma of the lung showing a predominantl y 
tubulopapillary structural pattern still requires confirmation by appropriate 
immunohistochemical analysis. The classification of the second small tumor focus as a (hematogenous) metastasis that – despite a certain difference in histoarchitecture and cel l 
morphology in places – is based on the structure of the focus, which is lacking the fibrous remodeling or cicatricial zone here that is characteristic of a primary peripheral bronchopulmonary carcinoma. Vascular invasion can be seen in the intratumoral, thick -walled 
pulmonary vessels of the larger tumor, where there is tumor spread with endobronchial occlusion in a subsegmental branch of the bronchus. The R1 classification is explained by the observation that the tumor glands invading the pleura extend as far as the outer surface of the pleura in places and the tumor cells thus remain in the pleural space.    Result of immunohistochemical analysis (both tumor foci)  
CK7 positive throughout, CK20 negative. TTF1.positive (in the smaller focus more than in the larger one), only isolated tumor cells with delicate cell membrane staining for surfactant protein B.  This not only confirms that it is an adenocarcinoma of the lung and, but also supports the view that the smaller focus represents the metastasis of the larger focus  
seen in 1.) and classified as primary tumor.

REPORT ON FINDINGS 
Macroscopy 
1.) Middle lobe: inflated, fixed lobe of lung measuring 12 x 11 x 3.3 em, central bronchus resection plane 
located 0.4 em proximal to the bifurcation into the segmental bronchi and closed by a 6 em long staple suture 
line running horizontally in a ventrodorsal direction. Similarly a 5 em long staple suture line runs cranially to 
the hilus. At the hilus two partly lesioned blackish nodes, 1.3 and 0.4 em in size. Pleura of partly turbid and 
cloudy appearance, irregular patches of blackish pigment with partially bloody coating or hemorrhagic patches 
over S4. Pleura over S4 shows slight central protmsion in an area of about 1 em, central retraction and cranially 
a flat protrusion in an area of about 3 em. Under this is a relatively firm, predominantly whitish, centrally 
grayish vitreous tumor, max. 3.2 em in size, with partly blackish pigmentation, an arcuate demarcation, 
extending close to the visceral pleura with endobronchial growth in and obstruction of a subsegmental branch of 
B4; distance of endobronchial tumor growth from the bronchus resection plane about 0.9 em. Tumor extending 
close to the staple suture line first described and separated from this by whitish hardened tissue. Other airways 
and rest of parenchyma inconspicuous, only vessels prominent and relatively dilated. Also in S5 a peripheral, 
subpleural compact area, max. 2 em in size, section surfaces pale brownish, max. thickness 0.2 em. 
2.) Interlobar LN (station 11) right: 1 em lesioned node or node part. 
3.) Hilar LN (station 10) right: two lesioned nodes or node parts with some surrounding tissue, 0.6 and 0.2 em. 
4.) Subcarinal LN (station 7): 1.5 em lesioned node or node part some surrounding tissue. 
Examined: 
1.) 1 section of tumor with immediately adjacent visceral pleura, I section of tumor with whitish area to first­
named staple suture line (staple suture line marked green), I section of tumor with endobronchial tumor growth,

Page 4 of 4 "," Based on the surgical pathology report, here is the assessment:

Site: Lung (This is mentioned in the clinical diagnosis)

Laterality: Not provided (The report does not mention whether it is right or left lung cancer)

Histology: Not completely specified, but there is a mention of a ""poorly circumscribed stellate firm gray-white tumor"" which could suggest a carcinoma. However, a definitive histological diagnosis requires further investigation.

Stage: Also not provided in the report. Staging would require additional information such as the size of the primary tumor, involvement of lymph nodes, and presence of metastasis.

Grade: Not provided. This would typically require microscopic examination of tissue samples to assess the degree of differentiation of the cancer cells.

Behavior: Malignant (This is implied by the clinical diagnosis of lung cancer).",,,

Comments
Two peribronchial lymph nodes were identified within specimen #4,
demonstrates a small focus of adenocarcinoma. Therefore, this is
staged as a pN1.
The level 10 lymph nodes left lung, level 7 lymph nodes left lung,
and level 5 lymph nodes left lung were all received fragmented and
therefore an accurate node count cannot be performed.
An elastic stain was performed which demonstrates the adenocarcinoma
to extend up to but not into or through the visceral pleura (with
appropriate positive control).
At the request of the undersigned pathologist, these slides have
been additionally reviewed by Dr. ^ who concurs with the
diagnosis.

ENO OF REPORT 
"," Site: Right upper lobe
 Laterality: Right
 Histology: Squamous cell (epidermoid) carcinoma, keratinizing type
 Stage: pT2aN0MX
 Grade: Moderately differentiated (G2)
 Behavior: Malignant, as indicated by the presence of a primary tumor with invasion into surrounding tissues.

The justification for these choices is based on the provided surgical pathology report, which details the gross and microscopic examination of the specimens received. The report describes a tumor in the right upper lobe, which was identified as squamous cell carcinoma, keratinizing type, and moderately differentiated (G2). The stage was determined to be pT2aN0MX based on the size of the tumor (>3 em but <= 5 em), the absence of regional lymph node metastasis, and the inability to assess distant metastasis. The behavior of the tumor is malignant, as it shows evidence of invasion into surrounding tissues.",,,

PATHOLOGY
PART #1: RIGHT LOWER LOBE WEDGE
Resident Pathologist:
The specimen is received fresh labeled and
designated right lower lobe wedge. It consists of an identifiable
wedge of lung weighing 200 gms ,and measures 12 x 9 x 4 cm. There is
a palpable nodule present. The margin is stapled close, and there are
grossly identifiable vessels and airways present at the margin.
The tumor measures 2.5 cm and is located approximately the central
portion of the specimen. It approaches within 1 cm of the stapled
margin. The tumor is gray/white and firm, well demarcated from the
surrounding low parenchyma. It approaches to within 1 cm of the inked
pleural surface. The uninvolved lung parenchyma shows mucous plugging
focally. The remaining parenchyma is beefy red and otherwise
unremarkable. Representative sections are submitted.

Left upper lobe mass. No preoperative tissue diagnosis . 
MACROSCOPIC 
One specimen submitted. 
The specimen is labelled 'left upper lobe wedge resection' and consists of a wedge oflung tissue, 130 x 
70 x 30 mm. The specimen bears a line of staples 110 mm in length. Protruding from one aspect of 
the pleural surface is a palpable mass. The pleura is free and mobile over the mass. 35 mm away from 
this lesion is a firm pleural plaque, 30 mm in diameter. Elsewhere the pleura shows some irregular 
grey and white discolouration. Serial slicing reveals a well defined yellowish white tumour mass, 25 
mm in greatest diameter, approximately 2 mm deep to the pleura. The cut surface shows small areas of 
yellowish necrosis. The tumour is at least 25 mm clear of the stapled surgical margin. No other lesions 
are identified. The uninvolved lung shows severe emphysema. The mass lesion has been sampled for 
Microbiology and for  [IA-IB tumour with overlying pleura; lC-ID pleural _iir decalcification; IE-IF uninvolved lung parenchyma.] 
MICROSCOPY 
Sections reveal a peripherally located moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma demonstrating 
predominantly acinar and focal solid architecture. The tumour is positive for CK7 and TTFI and 
negative for CK20. Zones of geographic necrosis are evident within the confines of the tumour. The 
tumour does not involve the pleura and is macroscopically clear of the intraparenchyma l stapled 
margin. No lymphatic or vascular invasion is identified and no perineural permeation by tumour is 
seen. Immediately adjacent alveolated lung parenchyma shows organising pneumonia and acute 
bronchopneumonia. Remaining lung shows emphysema. Focal areas of pleural and subpleural 
fibroelastotic scarring with calcification are noted. No granulomas are seen. 
SUMMARY 
Left upper lobe wedge resection: 
Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. 
Tumour size 25mm. 
Pleura not involved. 
Clear of margin. 
No lymphatic , vascular or perineural invasion. 
Pathological stage: n. 
Immediately adjacent alveolated lung parenchyma shows organising pneumonia and acute

CLINICAL HISTORY AND PRE - OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
M smoker (100 pack -years )with hx of prostate cancer ( ) and
COPD, now with a 1.5 cm RML mixed solid and ground -glass nodule and
multiple additional bilateral lung nodules.
MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received fresh, in six parts, each labeled with the
patient's name.
1. Part one is labeled 'right middle lobe nodule'. It consists of a
wedge shaped portion of lung measuring 11 x 5 x 2 cm. There is a
staple line identified on the specimen, measuring 10 cm in length.
There is a cut identified on the specimen measuring 1.5 cm in
length. On further sectioning there is a gray white ill defined area
measuring 1.1 x 1 cm is identified. This area is 0.3 cm from the
staple line and 0.4 cm from the pleural surface. The staple line is
inked blue. Further sectioning of the lung reveals spongy tan maroon
parenchyma. One portion from the ill defined area is submitted for
frozen section analysis. Representative sections are submitted.
2. Part two is labeled 'station #9 lymph node'. It consists of a
single lymph node measuring 2.4 x 1.5 x 1 cm. The cut surface is
grey-black. Entirely submitted in one cassette.
3. Part three is labeled 'station #10 lymph node'. It consists of
multiple irregular fragments of grey-black lymph nodes measuring 1.5
x 0.8 x 0.5 cm in aggregate. Entirely submitted in one cassette.
4. Part four is labeled 'completion of right middle lobectomy'. It
consists of a lobe of lung measuring 10.5 x 5.5 x 2 cm and weighing
38 grams. Two staple lines, measuring 8 cm and 6 cm in length are
noted. The bronchial and vascular margins are identified. The
serosal surface is grey-purple and shows a subpleural grey-black
nodule measuring 0.9 x 0.8 cm. Sectioning reveals an unremarkable red beefy lung parenchyma. The subpleural nodule likely represents
the lymph node. No discrete mass lesions are noted. Representative
sections are submitted.
5. Part five is labeled 'station #4 lymph node'. It consists of
three irregular segments of grey-black lymph nodes ranging from 0.2
to 0.5 cm in greatest dimension .Entirely submitted in one
cassette.
6. Part six is labeled 'station #7 lymph node'. It consists of a
single grey-black lymph node measuring 0.8 x 0 .5 x 0.3 cm. Entirely
submitted in one cassette.

MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY
KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS
Referring Physician
Body Site :Right middle lobe of lung
Specimen Type: Slides
Clinical Data :Adenocarcinoma
RESULTS: Wild-type gene.
INTERPRETATION:
No mutations were identified at codons 12 and 13 of the KRAS gene.
COMMENT:
Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to be associated with poor prognosis ,and resistance to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor
therapies in patients with non -small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). KRAS
mutations occur in 15-30% of NSCLC patients and are strongly
associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking history.
This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;
based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are
expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of
the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low
percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated
for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and codon 13 mutations in
fresh, frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue. In
particular the test performance has been established in samples of
colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung carcinoma which harbor
these mutations, although several other tissues are also known to
harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of pancreas, bile duct, ovary,
appendix, etc.).
Analysis of EGFR mutation or gene amplification status may provide
additional information regarding this patient's probability of
response to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies, if
clinically indicated. See references.
METHOD/LIMITATION:
Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is
selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified
and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to
exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single
nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;
primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel
electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or
negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants
or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

EGFR Mutation Analysis
Referring Physician:
Body Site :Right middle lobe of lung
Clinical Data :Adenocarcinoma
RESULTS: No mutation detected.
INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified in the sample provided
for analysis .Fewer than 5% of non-small cell lung carcinoma
patients without identifiable mutations are reported to be
responsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies. COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more tumor cellularity is optimal
for this mutation analysis. The sample submitted showed 70% tumor
cellularity upon pathologist review.
A frequently occurring sequence change 2361>GA (Q787Q) was
identified .This polymorphism is known not to have clinical
significance.
Mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with
differential responsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase
inhibitor (TKI) therapies. The objective response rate among
patients with a sensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%.
This assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain;
based on the current literature ,most mutations in non -small-cell
lung carcinoma (NSCLC) are expected to occur in these exons.
Mutations present in less than 10-20 %of extracted DNA may not be
detected by this method .Mutation status in a sample may change
during tumor progression or the course of therapy; therefore, this
result cannot be used to infer the presence or absence of a mutation
in another sample or sub-sample obtained from this tumor.
This test is validated for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The
clinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types
is unknown.
METHOD:
Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is
selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified
and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to
exons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by
bi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary gel
electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or
negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants
or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

INTEGRATED ONCOLOGY
Fluorescence In-Situ Hybridization (FISH)
Referring Physician
Body Site: Right middle lobe of lung
Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma
INTERPRETATION:
Negative for a rearrangement involving the ALK gene.
Probe #Nuclei Examined % Positive Nuclei %
Control values
2p23(ALK) 50 0.0 <15 A total of 50 cells were scored.
FINDINGS:
FISH was performed on paraffin embedded tissue sections using the
Vysis ALK Break Apart Probe for the ALK gene at 2p23 (
FDA approved). When a rearrangement involving ALK is
present, either inversion or translocation, one of the two fusion
signals separates as one red and one green signal. In this
specimen, separated signals were present in 0% of the nuclei scored.
This result is within the normal limits.
COMMENTS: Three to four copies of ALK were observed in 26.0% of
cells. This gain of intact ALK fusion hybridization signals
represents an aneuploid population with extra copies of chromosome
2/2p ALK region .Additional copies of ALK are not uncommon in
NSCLCs, although the significance of extra copies of the ALK gene in
lung carcinoma is unclear at this time (Salido M. et al. J Thorac
Oncol. 2011;6:21-27).

REPORT ON FINDINGS 
Macros copy 
1.) Right lower lobe: after attempted inflation of lower lobe at the deformed base measuring 10.5 x 7.5 em and 
up to 12 em high, central bronchus resection plane located at the level of the bifurcation of B6. At the hilus are 
two grayish-black nodes, 2 and 1.3 em in size. Parenchyma shows incomplete atelectasis or compression by a 
tumor that is soft to moderately firm, focally softened and these areas yellowish, otherwise predominantly pale 
brownish, in sections with small grayish-black patches, with the main mass in segment 8 and adjacent sections 
of S6 and S9, max. 8.5 em in size, with a predominantly clear and somewhat arcuate demarcation, extending 
right up to the pleura at the junction S6/8. Opening or truncation of intermediate branches of B8 in the tumor. 
Narrowing of some subsegmental branches ofB6 and B9. Pleura shows diffuse dark discoloration and extensive 
ragged grayish-yellow coating. 
2.) Parietal pleura: flat preparation 8.5 x 3.2 em and up to 0.7 em thick with turbid and patchy brownish 
discoloration, in some areas with ragged grayish-yellow coating of surface. 
3.) Lobar LN (station 12) upper lobe right: 1.8 em lesioned node or node part. 
4.) Lobar LN (station 12) middle lobe right: 2 em lesioned node or node part. 
5.) Hilar LN (station 10) right: two 0.6 em lesioned nodes or node paris. 
6.) Pulmonary ligament LN (station 9) right: three lesioned grayish-black nodes or node parts between 0.3 and 
0.4 em, with some sunounding tissue in parts. 
7.) Paraesophageal LN (station 8) right: 1.2 em lesioned grayish-black node. 
8.) Low paratracheal LN (station 4) right: four lesioned grayish-black nodes or node parts between 0.5 and 1.2 
em. 
9.) Prevascular and retrotracheal LN (station 3) right: 2.2 em lesioned node or node part. 
Examined: 
1.) 2 sections of tumor with rest of parenchyma, 3 sections with pleura, S8 ventrobasal, SIO dorsal, central 
bronchus resection plane, resection margins of vessels, hilar nodes (larger ones halved), 
2.) 6 sections, 
3.)-9.) All material (in 3., 4. + 9. preparation halved in each case), 
15 blocks, partly Elastica-van Gieson, PAS, diastase-PAS, iron staining.

 EVALUATION 
Primary diagnosis/diagnoses: 
Large, intermediate to peripheral bronchopulmonary, histologically poorly differentiated, large-cell and 
polymorphocellular nonkeratinizing squamous cell carcinoma of the right lower lobe of the lung mainly located 
in 88. 
TNM classification according to this picture pT2 pNO pMX RO, stage IB. 034.3 M8070/3. 
Secondary diagnosis/diagnoses: 
Focally marked active chronic inflammation predominantly in the tumor and focal chronic organizing retention 
pneumonia at the tumor margin (sample !.)). Fibrinous chronic granulating and fibrosing visceral (sample 1.)) 
and parietal pleuritis (sample 2.)). Uncharacteristic chronic, predominantly interstitial inflammation and fibrosis 
associated with focal fibrous and small honeycomb-like parenchyma remodeling along the ventrobasalmargin 
of 88. Subpleural accentuated intraalveolar macrophage accumulation in 810 (sample !.)). Lymph nodes with 
uncharacteristic reactive lesions and anthracotic pigment deposits (samples 1.) and 3.)-9.)). 
Remark/addendum: 
An unequivocal infiltration of the visceral pleura cannot be found. The resection margin of the bronchus and 
vessels and all lymph nodes ideutified and excised are tumor-free. 
No asbestos bodies are found in the prepared section planes. But very much further-reaching investigations, 
especially dust analyses, are needed to determine the asbestos exposure of the lung. "," 1. ""Site"": Right lower lobe. Justified as the report clearly mentions the tumor's location in the right lower lobe.
2. ""Laterality"": Not provided. The report does not mention any left or right-sided dominance of the condition.
3. ""Histology"": Large-cell and polymorphocellular nonkeratinizing squamous cell carcinoma. Justified as the report describes the tumor as histologically poorly differentiated, large-cell and polymorphocellular nonkeratinizing squamous cell carcinoma.
4. ""Stage"": pT2 pNO pMX RO, stage IB. Justified as the report provides the TNM classification of the tumor as pT2 pNO pMX RO, stage IB.
5. ""Grade"": Not provided. The report does not mention the grade of differentiation for this tumor.
6. ""Behavior"": Malignant. Justified as the tumor is classified as a squamous cell carcinoma, which is by definition a malignant tumor.",,,

Three specimens are received: 
I: LLUNG 
Macroscopy: 
Specimen consists ofa left pneumonectomy specimen measuring 300 x 290 x 58 mm in the 
inflated state. There is an area of adhesion between the upper and lower lobes across the 
oblique fissure. The pleura otherwise appears normal. Located in the upper lobe 25 mm from 
the resection margin is a large well circumscribed firm grey mass measuring 62 nun in 
maximal dimension. It appears to extend across the oblique fissure into the lower lobe. It 
comes close to the external pleural margin but it appears to be clear of it. The tumour shows 
central necrosis and cavitation . Near its most medial aspect of the specimen, several lymph 
nodes show some pale discolouration suggestive of direct invasion by tumour. Adjacent lung 
tissue shows evidence of mild centri-acinar emphysema. The lung tissue distal to the turnouT 
in the lower lobe shows yellow discolouration suggcstive of lipoid pneumonia. [Bronchial

Microscopy : 
Sections show a poorly differentiated carcinoma in which there are some squamous features. 
The tumour has central necrosis. It invades across the oblique fissure to involve both lobes. 
Blood vessel invasion is present and there is tumour within an intrapulmonary peribronchial 
lymph node. The rumour is clear of the bronchial margin. Centriacinar emphysema is nOled. 
Lung distal to the tumour shows patchy organising pneumonia and endogenous lipid 
pneumonia with collections of intra-alveolar foamy macrophages.
