The cervix is amputated and per surgeon was\nmacerated during surgery. The separate portion of cervix measures 3.5 x 2.6 x\n1.9 cm and demonstrates a tan smooth ectocervix with a 1.3 cm os. The\nendocervical canal is covered with a tan-yellowmucosa which focally appears\nfriable. The endometrial cavity is 6.5 (cornu to cornu) x 7.3 cm (to point of\ncervical amputation) is filled with a 7.8 x 5.5 x 2.1 cm friable fungating\nmass. The tumor primarily involves the anterior wall but extends over the\nfundus partially onto the posterior wall to within 1.1 cm of the amputation\nsite of the cervix. The tumor is focally necrotic and invades 1.1 cm into a\n1.6 cm myometrium. A representative section of the tumor is frozen as AF1\n(remnant Al). The remaining endometrium is tan and approximately 1 mm in\nthickness. The myometrium which is on average 2 cm thick is tan and partially\ntrabeculated with one intramural white whorled nodule, up to 0.7 cm,\nconsistent with leiomyoma. The serosal surface is tan and smooth with no\ngross abnormalities identified.\nThe right fallopian tube, 8.5 cm long is distally dilated to 1.7 cm in\ndiameter. Proximally, the diameter is 0.4 cm. The surface of the right\nfallopian tube demonstrates focal yellow discoloration and opening the tube\nreveals a cystically dilated tube with yellow studding of the luminal\nsurface. The cystic dilated portion is filled with brown-red liquid. The\nright ovary, 3.5 x 1.5 x 1 cm, is grossly unremarkable.

The tumor extends from the endometrial cavity to the lower uterine segment and towards the exocervix. Gross invasion into the myometrium is identified.\nThe cut surface of the tumor appears pale-tan, focally hemorrhagic and partially necrotic. The\ndistance from the tumor to the closest margins are as follows: 1.4 cm from the anterior exocervix,\n0.9 cm from the posterior exocervix and <0.1 cm from the closest serosal surface (posterior\naspect). The cervical canal is patent and shows small amounts of mucoid material. The cervix\nreveals a few Nabothian cysts, the largest measuring 0.2 cm in diameter. All of the Nabothian\ncysts are filled with tan gelatinous material. The right ovary measures 2.0 x 1.1 x 0.9 cm. The\nsurface of the right ovary appears tan and slightly nodular. Cross sections show corpus albicans.\nWithin the right parovarian tissue, one poorly defined nodule is identified measuring 0.4 x 0.3 x\n0.3 cm. The cut surface of the nodule appears homogeneously white, solid and firm. The right\nfallopian tube measures 5.0 cm in length x 0.7 cm in diameter. The surface of the right fallopian\ntube appears pink-tan and smooth, showing one para tubular cyst measuring 0.2 cm in maximum\ndimension (filled with white milky fluid). Cross sections appear pale-tan and grossly\nunremarkable. The left ovary measures 1.9 x 1.1 x 0.8 cm. The surface of the left ovary appears\ntan and slightly nodular. Cross sections show corpus albicans. The left fallopian tube measures\n5.5 cm in length x 0.6 cm in diameter. The surface of the left fallopian tube appears pink-tan and\nsmooth. Cross sections appear pale-tan and grossly unremarkable. Multiple sections from both\novaries/ fallopian tubes, as well as two pieces of the endometrial tumor have been taken for\ntissue banking. Representative sections are submitted as follows:\n2A section of left ovary/fallopian tube, previously submitted by research PA\n2B section of right ovary/fallopian tube, previously submitted by research PA\n2C endometrial tumor (posterior aspect), previously submitted by research PA\n2D right fimbria, longitudinally bisected\n2E sections of right fallopian tube, adjacent to tissue banking\n2F-2G remainder of right fallopian tube, EIT\n2H nodule within right parovarian tissue, bisected and EIT\n21 sections of right ovary, adjacent to tissue banking\n2J-2L remainder of right ovary, EIT\n2M left fimbria , longitudinally bisected\n2N sections of left fallopian tube, adjacent to tissue banking\n20-2P remainder of left fallopian tube, EIT\n2Q sections of left ovary, adjacent to tissue banking\n2R-2T remainder of left ovary, EIT\n2U-2Y a full thickness/transverse section of endo/myometrium, including endometrial tumor,\nanterior aspect (blocks 2V-2W and 2X-2Y each contains a bisected section)\n2Z-2AB a full length/partial thickness section of endo/myometrium, including endometrial tumor,\nfrom endometrial cavity to exocervix, anterior aspect\n2AC tumor with closest serosal surface, anterior aspect (adjacent to the fundus)\n2AD-2AF a partial thickness/transverse section of endo/myometrium, including endometrialtumor, posterior aspect\n2AG-2AJ a full length/partial thickness section of endo/myometrium, including endometrial tumor,\nfrom endometrial cavity to exocervix, posterior aspect\n2AK tumor with closest serosal surface, posterior aspect (adjacent to the fundus)",

The tumor at the uterine cavity represents the largest tumor bulk and it\ninvades into the outer half of the anterior myometrium but does not directly extend to\nthe uterine serosa; there is concurrent multifocal microscopic serosal tumor deposits\npresent on the anterior serosal surface (not in contiguity with the intrauterine\ntumor). There is focal tumor involvement of the ovarian surface with associated\nparenchymal tumor nodules in both ovaries. The lumen of the right distal fallopian\ntube and fimbria is extensively involved and extended by multinodular tumor deposit.\nWhile it is possible that the high-grade serous may have originated from the right\ndistal fallopian tube or alternatively that the tumors in the uterus and the right\nfallopian tube represent synchronous primaries, the distribution of the disease is\nmost in keeping with a uterine primary that subsequently metastasized to the different\nextra-uterine sites.This is also supported by the immunostaining findings that both the uterine tumor and the right tubal tumor show only weak focal nuclear WT1\nimmunoreactivity, in contrast to the usually strong and diffuse WT1 immunoreactivity\nobserved in the great majority of primary ovarian/tubal serous carcinomas.\nClinical History as Provided by Submitting Physician:\nHigh-grade endometrial Ca on biopsy\nGross Description:\nReceived are four containers, each labelled with the patient's name, XXXXXXXXXXX and\ndemographics.\nContainer A is labelled RIGHT PELVIC LYMPH NODES and consists of multiple pieces of\nfibrofatty tissue aggregating to 7 x 2.5 x 0.5 cm. Two lymph nodes are identified\nwithin the fibrofatty tissue measuring 2 x 1.3 x 0.5 cm and 2 x 0.7 x 0.2 cm,\nrespectively and are submitted in toto in cassettes Al and A2. The remainder of the\nfibrofatty tissue is submitted in cassettes A3 and A4.\nContainer B is labelled LEFT PELVIC LYMPH NODE and consists of multiple pieces of\nfibrofatty tissue aggregating to 4.5 x 3 x 1 cm. Two lymph nodes are identified\nwithin, one measuring 2 x 1 x 0.4 cm and the other measuring 1.9 x 0.8 x 0.4 cm. They\nare sectioned and submitted in B1 and B2, respectively. The remainder of the\nfibrofatty tissue is submitted in B3 and B4.\nContainer C is labelled UTERUS, CERVIX BILATERAL TUBES, AND OVARIES and consists of a\ntotal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy specimen. The uterus measures\n4.4 x 3.6 x 2.5 cm, left fallopian tube measures 5.6 x 0.5 cm, left ovary measures 2 x\n1x 1.3 cm, right fallopian tube measuring 6 x 0.5 cm at its attachment site to the\nuterus, dilating up to 1.5 cm at its fimbriated end, right ovary measuring 2 x 1 x 0.5\ncm.\nThe serosal surface is tan-brown, smooth, shiny, and free of any adhesions. The\nectocervix measures 1.8 x 2.4 cm and it is covered by a glistening white mucosa. The\nexternal os is slit-like and measures 0.7 cm. The endocervical canal measures 2.1 cm\nand involved by a friable tumor in the proximal region. The same friable white\nexophytic tumor is present, diffusely involving the endometrial cavity. On cute\nsections, the tumor invades into the out half of the anterior myometrium (to within\n0.3 cm of the serosal surface) but does not extend to the serosa.\nLeft fallopian tube is unremarkable. The left ovary is multinodular and cystic and\nthere are several golden areas which grossly resemble the appearance of corpora lutea.\nThe right fallopian tube has multiple nodules towards its fimbriated end, the largest\nof which measures 1 cm in diameter. Cut sections through the nodules show a white,\nsoft mass with a central area of hemorrhage. These nodules appear to be mostly\ncontained within the lumen of the fallopian tube. There are also several cystic\nspaces near the fimbriated end, the largest measuring 0.7 cm in diameter, filled with\na mucinous-like material. The right ovary is multinodular and golden in appearance,\nand otherwise unremarkable. Representative sections are submitted as follows:\nCl-C2 -representative sections of left ovary\nC3-C4 -representative sections of left fallopian tube\nC5-C6 -right ovary submitted in toto\nC7-C10 -Right fallopian tube mass, submitted in toto\nC11,C12-Remainder of right fallopian tube\nC13 -posterior cervix\nC14 -anterior cervix\nC15-posterior cul-de-sac\nC16-C26-posterior endomyometrium (transverse sections from inferior to superior),\nsubmitted in toto\nC27-C39-anterior endomyometrium (transverse sections from inferior to superior),\nsubmitted in toto Container D is labelled OMENTUM and consists of a single piece of fibrofatty tissue\nmeasuring 10 x 5 x 0.8 cm. Grossly, the tissue is tan-yellow with strands of fibrous\ntissue within it. At one edge, there is a slightly firmer piece of adipose tissue\nmeasuring 2 x 1 x 0.7 cm.

The stage is not explicitly provided, but based on the description of lymph node involvement, it may be at least stage II. The grade is given as FIGO Grade 2, which indicates an intermediate level of differentiation for the tumor cells. Finally, the behavior is malignant because endometrioid adenocarcinoma is a type of cancer."

The uterus is about 7.5 x 6.0 x 6.0 cm. The cervical\nportion of the uterus is 2.5 x 2.5 x 2.2 cm. The endometrial cavity is about 4.0 cm wide and about 4.0 cm\nin length. The endometrial lining is 0.1 cm. The muscular uterine wall ranges from 1.2 to 2.0 cm in\nmaximum thickness. There are parametrial tissues attached to the uterus. Those on the right are about\n2.5 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm and hose on the left are about 2.5 x 12 x 0.8 cm. The right ovary is. 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm.\nA 1.3 x 0.7 x 02 cm portion of right ovary appears to have been previously removed for research\npurposes. The right fallopian tube is 4.5 cm in length and 0.3-0.5 cm in diameter. The lumen is 0.1 cm.\nThe left ovary is 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm. The left fallopian tube is 4.5 cm in length and 0.4-0.6 cm in diameter.\nThe lumen is 0.1 cm.\nThere is a soft, tan, friable, hemorrhagic, pedunculated 5.5 x 5.0 x 3.5 cm endometrial tumor that largely\nreplaces the uterine fundus, corpus, and lower uterine segment. The tumor invades greater than 95% of\nthe myometrial wall in the lower uterine segment (grossly 2.0 cm into a 2.0 cm myometrial wall), The\ntumor abuts the serosa of the anterior and posterior lower uterine segment but does not grossly extend\nthrough the serosa. The tumor does not grossly extend into the ectocervix or parametrial soft tissues. A\n1.0 x 0.7 x 0.3 cm nodule is present in the posterior endocervical wall, possibly representing tumor versus\npost-fixation artifact. The endocervical canal is otherwise uninvolved by tumor. No metastatic tumor is\nidentified in the adnexa.\nink key: anterior uterine serosa - yellow; posterior uterine serosa - black.\nSURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT\nPage 2 o15 ***** **** Arl+4andum - Please See End of Report \"\"-\"******\nGross photographs are obtained.\nRepresentative sections are submitted.\nSlide key:\nAl.

The cervix is received in\nseveral fragments as well as several additional separate nodules consistent\nwith leiomyomata. The uterine corpus is 9.5 x 9.5 x 8.2 cm overall. The\nendometrial cavity is remarkable for a tan, fungating, friable tumor mass\nwhich is approximately 3.5 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm. Due to the fragmented appearance\nof the uterus, anterior and posterior endometrial walls cannot be cut\nascertained. Sectioning through the tumormassreveals a tan-gray-white\nsurface. The tumormassis approximately 1.1 cm thick at its thickest\nmyometrial of up to 2.6 cm. The myometrium is tan, trabeculated, and is\nremarkable for numerous leiomyomata, the largest of which is 6.5 cm in\ngreatest dimension. The cut surfaces of the leiomyomata are white, whorled,\nno hemorrhage or necrosis is grossly noted. Additionally received in the same\ncontainer are two fragments of tissue compatible with disrupted cervix, the\ncervix is 3.5 x 2.5 cm overall, the endocervical canal is unremarkable. Also\nreceived are several well-circumscribed leiomyomata, the largest of which is 4\ncm in greatest dimension. The cut surfaces are white, whorled, and no\nhemorrhage or necrosis is noted. The presumed left ovary is 2.7 x 1.5 x 0.9\ncm. The external surface is tan-yellow and corrugated. The associated\nfallopian tube segment is 4.5 cm long x 0.4 an in diameter. One end is\nblunted, the opposing end contains tan-pink fimbria. Sectioning of the ovary\ndiscloses a tan-yellow, 1.1 cm cyst. The remaining ovarian parenchyma is\nunremarkable. The presumed right ovary is tan-yellow, 1.5 x 1.3 x 1 cm and\ndisplays a cerebriform external surface. The associated fallopian tube\nsegment is 3.5 cm long x 0.4 cm in diameter. One end is blunted, the opposing\nend contains tan-pink, delicate fimbria.

The myometrium underlying this area ranges up to 3.0 cm, The polypoid\nlesion focally dips down into the myometrium for 0.5 cm involving approximately 20% of the\nmyometrium. The myometrium has numerous, intramural, submucosal and subserosal nodules, A\nseparate 1,2 cm polyp is identified on the posterior endometrium. The endometrium averages\n0.1 to 0.2 cm in the normal appearing regions. The leiomyomata range up to 4.5 cm with the\nlargest leiomyoma being subserosal. No areas of hemorrhage, calcification or necrosis are\nidentified. The right fallopian tube is fimbriated and is 6.0 x 0,8 cm. The right ovary is\n1.8 x 1.7 x 0.8 cm. The ovary has superficial adhesions, The ovary is bisected to have an\nunremarkable yellow-tan to white, fibrous stroma. The left fallopian tube is fimbriated and\nis 6.5 x 0.9 cm.

The uterus measures about 7.4 cm from the\nfundus to the ectocervix, 3.8 cm from cornu to cornu, and up to 4.1\ncm from the anterior surface to the posterior surface. The uterine\nserosa is tan-red, and generally smooth except for procedure-related\nartifact. Attached to the uterus, there is a small amount of pink-\ntan firm parametrial soft tissue. The parametrial soft tissues,\nbilaterally, appears grossly free of tumor. The cervix is about 2.8\ncm long and has a maximum diameter of 1.9 cm in the ectocervical\nregion. The mucosa lining the ectocervix is tan and smooth. The\nexternal cervical os is patent and about 0.9 cm in diameter. The\nuterus was previously incised on both sides at the time of the\nintraoperative consult. The cervical transformation zone is\ndistinct. The endocervical canal is about 2.1 cm long and lined forPage 2 of 6 Page 3 of 6\n(coythe most part by slightly rugose tan mucosa. In the posterior\nendocervix, there are two tiny endocervical polyps, measuring about\n0.2 and 0.3 cm in maximum dimension, each is composed of semi-soft\ntan-white tissue. Cut sections of the cervix reveal multiple mucus-\nfilled cysts ranging from about 0.1 to 0.3 cm in diameter. The\ncervix appears grossly free of tumor. The endometrial cavity is\nabout 5.0 cm long and up to 3.0 cm in diameter. The endometrial\ncavity is largely occupied by an exophytic polypoid pale tan tumor\nmass that has a friable and focally papillated surface. The tumor\nmass measures about 4.2 x 3.0 cm in surface area and has a maximum\nthickness of about 1.6 cm, including exophytic and endophytic\ncomponents. extensively involves the uterine fundus, anterior\nuterine corpus, posterior uterine corpus, and extends into the\nposterior lower uterine segment. Upon sectioning the uterus,\ninvasive carcinoma is seen involving the fundus, posterior uterine\ncorpus and anterior uterine corpus. In the posterior fundus\nand posterior corpus, greater than 50% of the wall thickness is\ninvolved by tumor. Tumor in the anterior uterus and in the posterior\nlower uterine segment is more superficially invasive (involves less\nthan 50% of the wall thickness). Within the uterus, mostly in the\nlower anterior corpus and lower uterine segment, there is a small\namount of uninvolved tan endometrium that has a maximum thickness of\nless than 0.1 cm. Within the uterus, there are five sharply\ncircumscribed intramural leiomyomas that measure about 0.3, 0.5,\n0.6, 1.2 and 1.5 cm in maximum dimensions. The smallest and second\nsmallest leiomyomas are in the fundus. The third smallest\nleiomyoma is located in the anterior lower uterine segment. The\nlargest and second largest leiomyomas are located in the posterior\nuterine corpus. The largest and second largest leiomyomas have firm\nwhite cut surfaces without grossly evident areas of hemorrhage\nor necrosis. The second largest leiomyoma is partially calcified.\nThe smallest and second smallest leiomyomas have firm tan-white\nwhorled cut surfaces without grossly evident areas of hemorrhage or\nnecrosis. The uninvolved myometrium is semi-firm, tan-pink, up\nto 1.8 cm in thickness and shows trabeculations and focal minute\ncystic spaces suggestive of adenomyosis.\nRepresentative sections.\nL.

Within the anterior and posterior myometrium is a 5.2 x 5.1 x 5.0 cm circumscribed\ntan-white whorled nodule, grossly consistent with a leiomyoma. This leiomyoma is compressing up against and displacing the\nmajority of the endometrium. The endometrial cavity measures 3.5 x 2.5 cm and the endocervical cavity measures 3.2 x 0.9 cm.\nThe uterus is serially sectioned to reveal an average endometrial thickness of 0.1 cm and an average myometrial thickness of 1.4\ncm.

The external surface of\nthe uterus is dull and covered by multiple fine adhesions. There is an area (1.5 x\n1.0 cm) in the lower pole of the left ovary which is ragged and probably represents a\nresection margin (inked black). There is no visible gross lesion on the external\nsurface of the specimen . The cervix measures 2.2 x 2.0 cm and is covered by red-tan\nslightly hemorrhagic smooth mucosa. The external os is slit-like and measures 0.4 x\n0.2 cm. The endocervical canal is 2.7 cm in length and has pink-tan herringbone\nmucosa . The endometrial cavity measures 5.5 cm in length x 3.7 cm from cornu to\ncornu. There is anextensive exophytic papillary growth involving almost the entire\nendometrium sparing only the lower uterine segment, 0.3 cm on the anterior surface and\n1.1 cm from the posterior surface. The uninvolved endometrium has pink-tan appearance\nand measures 0.2 to 0.4 cm in thickness. The tumor mass is white-tan, fragile and\npapillary. The tumor measures 6.2 cm (combined on anterior and posterior surface) x\n5.2 cm x 1.4 cm (maximum thickness). The central portion of the tumor is necrotic.\nGrossly, the tumor invades myometrium with the maximum extent of the anterior uterine\nwall, 1. 4 cm of muscle invasion with 2.8 cm wall thickness. There is a partially\ncalcified leiomyoma (4.5 cm in diameter) located within the myometrium of the\nposterior wall with a focal area of hemorrhage. Both fallopian tubes have previously\nremoved central portions, consistent with a history of bilateral tubal ligation.\nThere is a paratubal cyst (0.4 cm in diameter) with smooth internal lining and filled\nwith yellow fluid, which is located in the distal portion of the right fallopian tube.\nOtherwise, the fallopian tubes are unremarkable. The left ovary is composed of\nsclerotic white-yellow tissue with multiple corpora albicantia. The right ovary has\nsmooth and glistening pink-tan surface with white-yellow sclerotic parenchyma and\nmultiple corpora albicantia.

Metastases are noted\nin the right ovary, periappendiceal fat (at the tip), and within the mesenteric\nfat of the small bowel. The metastases seen in the small bowel mesentery and\novary show somewhat divergent (higher grade) histology than the primary\nendometrioid adenocarcinoma. The pattern of infiltration as well as the\ncytology raised the possibility of a synchronous neuroendocrine carcinoma. As a\nresult, immunohistochemical stains for cytokeratin 7, cytokeratin 20,\nchromogranin, and synaptophysin were performed on both the endometrium and\novarian tumor (B3 and B 13). The staining profiles are identical and consistent\nwith a metastatic endometrioid adenocarcinoma. Neuroendocrine differentiation\nis not seen by immunohistochemistry.

Comment:\nHistologic sections of the above specimens show extensive involvement by serous adenocarcinoma of primary uterine\ncorpus origin. A uterine corpus primary is supported by involvement of the uterine corpus with transmural myometrial\ninvasion to the serosa with extensive lymphovascular space invasion. The involvement of the ovaries is multinodular\nwith preserved intervening areas of ovarian tissue ,also supporting metastases to the ovaries. Additionally,\nrepresentative sections from the endometrial tumor and the left ovarian tumor were evaluated by\nimmunohistochemistry.

The cervix has an\neccentric 0.4 cm os. The uterus is received with the attached bilateral fallopian tubes\nand ovaries and weighed with the tubes and ovaries removed. The cervix cannot be oriented\nanterior to posterior, and the ectocervical rim will be inked blue with the deeper tissues\ninked black. The uterine serosa has focal hemorrhagic adhesions and subserosal nodularity.\nThe uterus is bivalved to have a diffusely ragged, friable endometrium. The friable.\nragged endometrium appears to fill the entire cavity and is cauterized near the roughened\nremoved area of the previously amputated cervix. The ragged tumor-like area is 4.5 x 4 0\ncm.Sectioning the myometrium shows a 1.8 cm possibly posterior, calcified leiomyoma\nwithin the myometrium. The myometrium ranges up to 2.2 cm in this region, and there\nappears to he possible invasive tumor extending 1 6 cm. The tumor is sampled for tissue\nbanking at The tumor grossly appears to involve more than 50% of the\nmyometrium posteriorly. and the myometrium is disrupted and hemorrhagic on the anterior\nsurface. The anterior myometrium averages 0.8 cm in thickness. The tumor appears to\nextend with 0.2 cm between the tumor and inked serosa. The tumor diffusely extends more\nthan 50% of the myometrium both anterior and posterior The right fallopian tube is\ndisrupted and is 1.7 x 0.4 cm. The fimbria cannot be clearly identified. The right\novary is 2.5 x 2.0 x 1.2 cm. The ovary is sectioned to have a dense fibrous stroma with\nmultiple corpora albicantia. The left fallopian tube is a 1.5 cm ill-defined hemorrhagic\nsegment of fallopian tube which is adhesed to a 2.5 x 1.2 x 1.2 cm ovary. The ovary is\nsectioned to have a dense fibrous stroma with multiple corpora albicantia. Representative\nsections are sampled as labeled:\nC1-C3 -representative sections of cervix to include full cross section to\namputation site\nC4 -one full thickness cross section of posterior lower uterine segment,\nendometrium to serosa and a section of posterior fundic serosa with\nsubserosa nodules\nC5-C7 -additional posterior full thickness cross section of endometrial tumor\nto inked serosa\nC8-C11 -anterior full thickness cross sections of endometrium, myometrium and\ninked serosa with tumor\nC12-C13 -right ovary and possible tube sampled\nC14-C15 -left ovary and possible tube sampled\nC16,17 -additional sections of possible fallopian tubes\nD.Received in formalin labeled \"posterior cul-de-sac\" are two hemorrhagic fibroconnective\ntissue biopsies.

Occasional follicles composed predominantly or entirely of small\nlymphocytes some of which have a monocytoid appearance. Scattered, rare\nplasma cells are noted. Areas of fatty infiltration are also identified.\nIncreased numbers of histiocytes are seen in the dilated sinuses. An\nimmunohistochemical panel was performed to further characterize the\nlymphocytes with respect to architecture. B and T cells (CD20 and CD3\npositive, respectively) show appropriate zonation. The T cells are also\npositive for CD5 and CD43. No co-expression of CD20 and CD43 or CD5 is\nappreciated. The small germinal centers are positive for CD20, CD 10 and\nbcl-6, but negative for bcl-2. Some of the small follicles are positive for\nCD20 and bcl-2, but negative for CD 10 and bcl-6, these follicles most likely\nrepresent either mantle/marginal zone hyperplasia or primary follicles. CD21\nand CD23 stains highlight the follicular dendritic meshwork in the\nfollicles. Cyclin D 1 is positive in the endothelial cells, but negative in\nthe lymphocytes.\nThe combined morphologic and immunophenotypic features in this lymph node\nare most consistent with a reactive process. Clinical correlation and\nfollow-up is recommended.\nintradepartmental consultation:\nHematopathology, have been consulted on this case and concur with the\nfindings and interpretation.\nAddendum Diagnosis\nLYMPH NODE, LEFT OBTURATOR, EXCISION i,\nREACTIVE LYMPH NODE WITH SINUS HISTIOCYTOSISWV End of Addendum Report or Additional Results\nStaff Pathologist\nPATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS\nA.

The tumor involved the entire endometrial cavity and invaded with a pushing front, making measurement of the exact depth of invasion difficult. However, it is estimated to be approximately 35% of the myometrium thickness, which translates to approximately 14 mm of invasion into a myometrium of approximately 40 mm in thickness. The regional lymph nodes were examined and found to be uninvolved by the tumor. No distant metastasis was identified."

UTERUS, CERVIX, TUBES AND OVARIES\nLabeled with the patient's name, labeled \"uterus, cervix, tubes and ovaries\", and received fresh in the\nOperating Room for intraoperative frozen section, and subsequently fixed in formalin, is a 200 gram, total\nhysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy specimen. The uterus is about 9.5 x 6.5 x 6.5 cm in\ngreatest overall dimensions. The cervical portion of the uterus is about 2.5 cm in length and up to 2.7 cm\nin diameter. The external cervical os is 0.3 cm in diameter. The endocervical canal is about 2.5 cm long\nand up to 0.2 cm in width. The endometrial cavity is about 6 cm in length x 4.5 cm in diameter. The\nmuscular uterine wall is about 2.5 cm in maximum thickness. The endometrial mucosa ranges from\nabout 0.2 to 1.0 cm in thickness. The right ovary is 2.5 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm. The fimbriated right fallopian tube\nis 6.5 cm long and up to 0.5 cm in diameter. The left ovary is 2.3 x 1.7 x 1.5 cm. The fimbriated left\nfallopian tube is about 4.5 cm long and up to 0.6 cm in diameter.\nThe endometrial cavity is largely occupied by a soft tan friable exophytic focally papillated tumor that is\nabout 5.0 x 4.0 cm in area. The tumor replaces the endometrium of the anterior and posterior uterine\ncorpus and uterine fundus. Cut sections reveal induration of the underlying myometrium which appears\nto be infiltrated by firm tan-white tumor. The grossly evident invasive tumor involves about 75% of the\nuterine wall thickness. There is no serosal surface involvement or parametrial extension of tumor on\ngross inspection of the specimen. The cervix appears grossly free of tumor. No metastatic tumor is seen\nin the ovaries or fallopian tubes.\nSURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT\nPage 3 of 5 There is a small amount of uninvolved endometrium in the lower uterine segment. No normal appearing\nendometrium is seen in the uterine corpus or fundus. Within the uterus, there are also several tiny to\nsmall circumscribed intramural leiomyomas ranging from about 0.2 to 0.3 cm in diameter. Each of the\nleiomyomas is composed of firm solid tan tissue without grossly evident areas of hemorrhage or necrosis.\nThe cervix is remarkable only for a few mucus-filled cysts ranging from about 0.1 to 0.7 cm in diameter.\nBoth ovaries are atrophic. The left ovary shows relatively abundant yellow-tan cortical stroma which is\nfocally vaguely nodular. The left fallopian tube is grossly unremarkable. The right fallopian tube shows\nmild segmental luminal dilatation with a maximum luminal diameter of about 0.6 cm.\nInk key: Uterine serosal surface - black; parametrial margins - blue.\nRepresentative sections are submitted.\nSlide key:\nAl.

Adenocarcinoma replaces much of the mucosal surface of the upper endometrial\ncavity, without myometrial invasion.\nHISTOLOGIC TYPE: Moderately differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma (see comment)\nHISTOLOGIC GRADE (FIGO): FIGO grade 2 (architecture grade 2 ,nuclear grade 2).\nEXTENT OF INVASION: The greatest depth of invasion is at the anterior endocervix, where adenocarcinoma invades\n1.1cm and approaches to a distance of less than 0.5mm from the paracervical soft tissue margin (96% wall invasion).\nSEROSAL INVOLVEMENT: Not identified\nLOWER UTERINE SEGMENT INVOLVEMENT: Present in the posterior wall, with depth of invasion 0.5cm where wall\nthickness is 1.8cm (27%).\nCERVICAL INVOLVEMENT: Present ,with extensive stromal invasion (see above).\nADNEXAL INVOLVEMENT (SEE BELOW): Not identified.\nCERVICAL/VAGINAL MARGIN AND DISTANCE :Negative ;invasive carcinoma approaches to a distance of 0.2cm from the\nanterior ectocervical mucosal margin.\nLYMPHOVASCULAR SPACE INVASION: Present.\nHORMONE RECEPTORS: Tumor is estrogen receptor negative (0) and progesterone receptor negative (0).\nREGIONAL LYMPH NODES (SEE OTHER SPECIMENS ):No lymph nodes identified\nTOTAL NUMBER INVOLVED: 0\nTOTAL NUMBER EXAMINED: 0\nAJCC PATHOLOGIC STAGE ( classified as a primary uterine carcinoma ):pT2b pNx pMx\nFIGO STAGE GROUPING: IIB These stages are based on information available at the time of this report ,and are subject to change pending additional\ninformation and clinical review\nOvary, right, oophorectomy:\n-No significant pathologic abnormality, negative for malignancy.\nOvary, left, oophorectomy:\n-No significant pathologic abnormality, negative for malignancy.\nFallopian tube ,right,salpingectomy:\n-No significant pathologic abnormality, negative for malignancy.\nFallopian tube ,left, salpingectomy:\n-No significant pathologic abnormality ,negative for malignancy.\nComment:\nThe specimen shows moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with characteristic squamous morular growth pattern,\nsuggestive of an endometrioid type histology .The tumor is negative for estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor.\nThe tumor is positive for p16, but given the endometrioid histology the significance of this is unclear. The bulk of\ninvasive tumor is present in the high endocervical canal .According to clinical notes, the patient had a diagnostic\nendometrial biopsy in with endometrioid adenocarcinoma (FIGO 2). External beam radiation therapy followed.\nEndometrial biopsy in : returned endometrioid adenocarcinoma (FIGO 3 ).It is possible that while much of the\nupper corpus tumor responded to therapy ,residual adenocarcinoma in the LUS/endocervical canal region has selectively\nrecurred .Alternatively ,the endocervical tumor location and lack of upper corpus myometrial invasion raises\nthe possibility of an endocervical primary tumor. Clinical correlation is advised.\nClinical History:\nThe patient is with endometrial carcinoma.\nGross Description:\nReceived is one appropriately labeled container, additionally labeled \"cervix, uterus, both ovary and tube.\"\nAdnexa: The right fallopian tube and ovary are received attached to the uterine fundus .The left fallopian tube and ovary\nare separate in the container.\nWeight :140 grams\nShape :vaguely pear -shaped ; The uterus is received with a full thickness defect in the anterior lower uterine\nsegment/endocervical canal.

The\nuterus and cervix together weigh 87 grams and on reconstruction\nmeasure approximately 6.9 x 8 .4 x 4.7 cm. The cervix has a wrinkled\ngray-tan ectocervical mucosa. The os is patent . The uterine canal\nsounds to a depth of approximately 5.8 cm. The endocervical canal\nis lined by trabeculated tan gray to brown mucosa. The uterine\nserosa is smooth and tan-brown. The architecture is distorted by\nthe presence of a left fundic subserosal nodule 1.6 cm as well as a\nleft lateral subserosal to intramural nodule 1.8 cm. The lateral\nnodule has a bulging whorled tan gray fibrotic cut surface while the\nfundic nodule has a focally calcified cut surface. The uninvolved\nmyometrium measures up to 1.9 cm and is tan -pink and fibrotic. The\nendometrial canal is lined at the fundus extending to both the\nanterior and posterior aspects by a 3.5 x 3.3 x up to 0.9 cm friable\ngranular gray tan to pink papilliferous plaque like lesion. On\nsectioning this has a friable gray pink cut surface and grossly\nextends into the myometrium in the right lateral fundic region to a\nmaximum thickness of 2.4 cm. This is focally noted at its nearest\npoint 0.3 cm from the right lateral serosa . The small amount of\nparametrial soft tissue on each side shows no nodularity or gross\nlesions .The left fallopian tube measures 4.1 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm. The\nright fallopian tube measures 4.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm. Each has a smooth\ntan brown serosa with a tan wall and pinpoint lumen.

The specimen\nconsists of a total hysterectomy specimen to include a uterus with attached cervix and attached bilateral\nadnexa. Separate in the container are fragments of tan-gray friable soft tissue, approximately 6.5 x 6.5 x 3.4\ncm in aggregate dimension. The separate tissue within the container was discussed with\nwho states that it originated from within the uterus. No tissue was seen outside of the uterus at the time ofoperation.\nThe left fallopian tube with fimbriae is 3.5 cm in length and 1.0 cm in diameter. The ovary is tan-pink, 1.5 cm in\ngreatest dimension. Bivalving reveals a normal ovarian architecture. The right fallopian tube with fimbriae is 3\ncm in length and 0.7 cm in diameter. The ovary is tan-pink, 1.2 cm in greatest dimension.

The\nparacervical/parametrial margin is inked black. Upon bivalving, the endocervical canal is 1.0 cm, and the\nendometrial cavity is approximately 4.5 cm from cornu to cornu. Within the endometrium is a large tan-gray\nfungating mass involving 80% of the anterior endometrium and approximately 10% of the posterior\nendometrium. The mass is approximately 8.5 x 4.5 x 2.5 cm, extends to the lower uterine cavity, but does not\nappear to involve the lower uterine cavity or cervix. It is approximately 3.2 cm from the squamocolumnar\njunction and 2.2 cm to the anterior parametrial margin. Sectioning the anterior endometrium/myometrium, the\nmass extends into the myometrium approximately 0.6 cm, involving approximately 25% of the myometrium and\nis approximately 0.8 cm from the serosa.
