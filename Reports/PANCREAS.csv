Histology: Adenocarcinoma
Justification: Although the specific type of adenocarcinoma is not mentioned, it is a common histologic diagnosis for pancreatic tumors.

Stage: pT3NI (7th edition)
Justification: According to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC), this stage indicates that the primary tumor has invaded the peripancreatic soft tissues and there are metastases to regional lymph nodes.

B. Pancreas and spleen, partial pancreatectomy and splenectomy:
Undifferentiated carcinoma with a sarcomatoid component is
identified forming a solid 7.2 x 6.0 x 5.4 cm mass located in the
pancreatic tail. The tumor extends beyond the pancreas involving
the peripancreatic soft tissue. Angiolymphatic invasion is absent.
Perineural invasion is absent. Tumor necrosis is present. All
surgical resection margins are negative for tumor (minimum tumor
free margin, 2.6 cm, pancreatic body margin). The patient has had
no prior treatment. The adjacent non-neoplastic pancreatic
parenchyma shows focal atrophy. The spleen is unremarkable. A
single (1 of 22) regional lymph node is positive for metastatic
carcinoma.q
Immunoperoxidase studies were performed on paraffin sections of the
pancreatic tail mass using antibodies directed against the following
antigens: Keratin AEI/AE3, 5100 ,CD45, SMA, desmin ,CD30, ALKI. The
neoplastic cells are focally positive for keratin AE 1 /AE3, OSCAR
keratin ,and smooth muscle actin while being negative for S 100,

Comment
The intraductal papillary mutinous neoplasm with high grade dyspiasia is seen to involve the main
pancreatic duct with extension into the side branches- In the area of the Ampulla where the pancreatic
duct enters the duodenum, the neoplastic epithelium is seen to extend into the duodenum- in this
area, also there ismicroscopic invasion of the pancreatic duct wall. However, there is.. not invasion
into the wall of the duodenum..

Gross Des cription
A. Specimen A. is received fresh labeled ""gallbladder.' The specimen consists a club shaped
measuring 7.0 x 4.0 x 2.5 cm. The external surface is gray-tan with a small amount of adherent
fibroadipose tissue. The biLe duct is identified and is probe-patent measuring 0.5 cm in length. On
opening, no calculi is grossly appreciated.. The specimen contains a moderate amount of green
bile. The wall measures 0.2 cm at its greatest thickness. The mucosal surface is green-yellow and
velvet like- No tissue is submitted to the tissue procurement laboratoryr. Representative sections are submitted as Al.
8. Specimen B is received fresh for OR consult labeled ""Whipple specimen, frozen section."" The
specimen consists of the head of the pancreas, a portion of the duodenum, and a portion of the
stomach- The entire specimen measures 21.0 x 7.0 x 3.5 cm. The duodenum measures 14.0 cm in
length. The serosa of the duodenum is gray-tan and somewhat roughened. On opening the
duodenum ,a moderate amount of bile stained material is expelled. No polyps or nodularitiies grossly
appreciated on the mucosal surface- The ampulla of Vater is not prominent- The pancreas measures
5.x 3.5 x 2.5 cm. On palpating the pancreas, a mass is grossly appreciated. The pancreatic duct is
not probe-patent and grossly appears to be involved by tumor. Where the pancreatic duct empties
into the duodenum, the duct grossly presents with a fish-mouth appearance- On sectioning the
pancreas, the mass measures 3.0 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm_ The mass comes to within 1.0 cm of the pancreatic
margin of resection. The mass grossly appears to involve the duodenum and the common bile duct,
but grossly does not appear to extend to the attached stomach. No normal pancreatic parenchyma is
grossly appreciated- The attached stomach measures 7.0 cm along the greater curvature and 4.0 cm
along the: lesser curvature.. The serosa is tan-pink and smooth. Tl rnucosa is tan and exhibits
normal mucosal folds. Sectioning of the attached adipose tissue isolates 3 possible lymph nodes at
the head of the pancreas- No additional lymph nodes are isolated. All attached adipose tissue is
submitted for processing.. A representative section of the tumor is submitted to tissue procurement
laboratory.. Three representative frozen sections are taken and submitted as FSBI.3. Permanent
representative sections are submitted as:

Gross Description
A. The specimen is received fresh for frozen section anal s labeled 'bile duct ,pancreas,
duodenum ""The specimen consists of a rasected portion of the pancreatic head (4.5 x 4.x 3 cm) and
attached duodenum (1.2 cm length and 6 cm in greatest cfrcunsference).. The serosal surface of the
duodenum is brown-tan and smooth .Upon opening ,the Lumen contains a moderate amount of
viscous bile. The mucosal surface of the duodenum exhibits normal folds with no gross evidence
pofyps or nodularity.
The pancreatic margin resection is, marked with tick ink, the portal vein groove is m arked with blue
ink and the retroperitomeal surface is marked with green ink_ There is no stapled line grossly pre sent
that would indicate the superior mesentery artery ...A palpable pancreatic mass is identified. The
pancreatic, duct not probe patent and is totally occluded by the presence of the tumor .Serial
sectioning into the pancreas reveals a firm, yelk w -gray ,ill-defined mass
(4 x 3.5 x 2.5 cm) ,which abuts the retroperitoneal surfaceiuncinate process. Grossly the mass does appear to involve the common bile duct which is probe patent and somewhat dilatedwith an inserted
catheter .Grossly the mass does appear to involve the duodenal wall extending to the mucosal
surface and grossly involving the ampulla of Mater .There is a minimal amount of grossly uninvolved
pancreatic tissue .A section of the minimal amount of attached adipose tissue isolates 2 moderately

A. The specimen is received fresh labeled ""periduodenal nodule""_ The specimen consists of a
single, ovoid, rubbery lymph node measuring up to 12 cm in greatest dimension. There is a moderate
amount of adipose tissue attached to the lymph -node- No tissue was submitted to the Tissue
Procurement Laboratory.. The lymph node is bisected and is submitted entirely in 1 cassette A.
B. The specimen is labeled ""gallbladder""- The specimen consists of a gallbladder which
measures 9.5 x 3.5 x 3..5 cm. The serosa of the gallbladder is pink tan to dusky purple, smooth and
glistening. No transmural perforations are grossly identified- The gallbladder content consists of a
large amount of dark-green viscous bile. No gallstones are grossly identified- The mucosa of the
gallbladder is velvety, dark green. The gallbladder wall is averaging 0.2. cm in thickness. No lymph
nodes are grossly identified attached to the gallbladder neck. No tissue was submitted to the Tissue

lumen.. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted in 2. cassettes, 131 and 132-
C. The specimen is labeled ""retroperitoneal node "".The specimen consists of an irregular,
unoriented fragment of fibroadipose tissue measuring 3 x 2 x 1 cm. The specimen is serially
sectioned to .reveal a single potential lymph node :which measures up to 1.0. cm in greatest dimension.
No tissue was submitted to the Tissue Procurement Laboratory .The specimen is submitted entirely in
4 cassettes ,C1-C4, with potential lymph node in cassette C2.
D. The specimen is labeled ""Whipple, stitch is retroperitoneal margin"". The specimen consists of
a head of pancreas'` x 5 x 3.5 cm), with adjacent portion of duodenum (25 cm in length and up to 3.5
cm in circumference at. the distal resection margins) and distal portion of stomach (7.5 cm in length
and up to 12.0 cm in circumference at the proximal gastric margin). The serosa of the stomach is pink
tan, mildly congested ,smooth, glistening, while the outer surface of the duodenum is shaggy with a
small amount of fibroadipose tissue attached .There is moderate amount of lesser and greater
omental adipose tissue attached to the gastric wall. The pancreatic resection margin reveals a pink
tan, lobulated and grossly unremarkable pancreatic parenchyma. The peripheral aspects of the pancreatic head are composed of a small amount of yellow tan lobulated adipose tissue which is
ranging from 0.1 to 0 .5 cm in thickness .Prior to sectioning the specimen is inked as follows:
Green: Anterior aspect of the pancreatic head
Black: Superior aspect of the pancreatic resection margin
Orange: Inferior aspect luncinate process
Red: Medial aspect
Blue: Retroperitoneal aspect.
On opening the stomach reveals a pink tan, smooth, glistening mucosa which shows preservation of
rugae. Six distal cm of the duodenal mucosa has dusky red color.. The remaining mucosa of the
duodenum is pink tan, smooth, glistening, and has the usual intestinal folds. The ampulla of Water is
slightly prominent and grossly unremarkable- The common bile duct and main pancreatic duct are
grossly unremarkable. On sectioning the pancreatic head reveals a roughly ovoid, well defined,
rubbery tumor mass which measures up to 3.5 x 2.5 x 2 cm. The tumor partially involves uncinate
process and is 0.1 cm from the closest inferior and medial aspects of pancreatic head-, The tumor is
2.8 cm from the pancreatic resection margin, 1.2 cm from the retroperitoneal margin, and 0.5 cm from
anterior aspect of the pancreatic head. The cut surface of the tumor is pink tan, homogenous, without
evidence of necrosis or hemorrhage- The remainder of the pancreatic parenchyma is pink tan,
lobulated, and grossly unremarkable -On sectioning the adipose tissue of the peripheral aspects of
the pancreatic head, several potential lymph nodes are grossly identified whim measure up to 0.2 cm
in greatest dimension- Representative sections of the specimen are submitted for frozen section

COMMENT:
Mitotic figures in this neoplasm appear unusual, including elongated, pyknotic and
popcorn4ike forms, rendering precise mitotic evaluation challenging. Although this neoplasm
is clinically localized at the time of surgical resection, based on the above findings, closer
follow-up I evaluation for metastatic disease will be prudent.

diagnosis.
Gross Description
A.. Specimen A is received fresh for consult, labeled ""distal pancreas and spleen., frozen
The specimen consists of a. reseed distal pa ncreas (6.5 x 4.5 x 3..5 cm), and adjacent
spleen (9.0 x 6.5 x 3.5 cm), and adjacent adipose tissue and omentum (17.0 x 10.0 x 21 cm). The
most distal margin of the spleen stapled .The staples are removed and the closest adjacent
underlying tissue, which reveals the pancreatic duct is submitted for frozen section as F AI.. The
pancreatic duct is probe patent and grossly appears to be free of tumor .No normal pancreatic tissue
is grossly appreciated- A section of the pancreas consists of a firm, gray-tan mass j_..x...x... cm),
which grossly appears to extend to the margin of resection. Crossly, the mass does not extend to the
adjacent spleen. The capsule of the spleen is intact, and the cut. surface is grossly unremarkable.
Sectioning of the adjacent adipose tissue is olatesno definitive lymph nodes. A representative frozen
section is taken and submitted as FSA1. Permanent sections are taken and submitted

Gross Description
A. The specimen is received fresh for OR. consult labeled ""spleen and pancreas (check margin),
frozen section "".The spe cimen consists of a resected portion of the pancreas with adjacent spleen
(14.5 x 9..D .x T.0 cm). The pancreas measures 6.5 x 4.0 x 2..5 cm:). A palpable mass is grossly
appreciated. The overlying tissue is marked with blue ink. Serial sections reveal a partially calcified
brown-tan ill-defined mass (3.0 .x 2.0 x 2.0). The mass is located 4.0 cm from the pancreatic surgical
margin of resection abutting the overlying soft tissue. A portion of the tumor is taken and submitted for
frozen section as FSA:3. The pancreatic margin is removed tangentially and entirety submitted for
frozen sections FSAI and FSA2. The pancreatic duct is propatent and grossly free of tumor. The
remaining pancreatic parenchyma is grossly unremarkable. The attached spleen measures 11 -5 x 6.5
x 5.5 cm. The capsule is red brown and intact. Cut surface exhibits a grossly unremarkable spleen
parenchyma. Adjacent to the tissue is a moderate amount of fat (25.0 x 9_0 x 2.0 cm). A
representative section of the tumor is submitted to the T issue Procurement Laboratory. Permanent

cm), portion: of stomach (3.0 cm on the lesser curvature and 6.5 cm on the greater curvature),
duodenum (11.0 cm in length and 5.0 cm in circumference), and gallbladder (8..5 x 4.0 x 3.5 cm)_
The pancreatic margin of resection is removed and submitted tangentially .The portal vein groove is
marked with -yellow ink, removed and entirely submitted perpendicularly- The superior mesenteric
artery margin resection is marked with black ink, totally removed and entirely submitted
perpendicularly. The retroperitoneal surface marked with blue ink and is entirety submitted
perpendicularly. A palpable pancreatic mass is appreciated. The pancreatic duct is prole patent for
approximately 5 mm and is totally obstructed due to the presence of a firm, gray yellow, ill-defined
pancreatic mass. (4.0 x 3.0 x 2.0 emy The mass is approximately 5 mm from the pancreatic margin of
resection and grossly abuts the portal vein groove and the superior mesenteric artery margin of
resection -Grossly the mass appears to involve the wail of the common bite duct but does not appear
to involve the Ampulla of Vater or duodenum. The remainder of the pancreatic parenchyma is grossly
unremarkable. The duodenum and gastric mucosa exhibits normal mucosal folds with no gross:
evidence of modularity or polypoid lesions -A catheter is inserted in the common bile duct. The
gallbladder is filled with a small :amount of green viscous bite. There is 1 green-yellow calculi present
measuring 1.5 .x.1..0 x 1.0 cm. The rnucosal surface is green yellow and velvet: like. The wall of the
gallbladder ranges: from 0.1 cm to 0.3 cm in thickness On gross: examination, the gallbladder is free
of tumor. A section of the adjacent adipose tissue isolates 2 gray-tan, irregular lymph nodes
measuring 1.5 cm greatest dimension -The lymph nodes are isolated at the pancreas. A

grossly unremarkable spleen (14..0 x 8 - Ox 6. 0 cm). Eoth specimens are adhe rent to a moderate
amount of fat. The pancreatic margin of resection is stapled ..The staples are removed and the
underlying tissue is. removed t angentially and entirely submitted on frozen section as FSB'i. The
pancreatic duct is markedly dilated but is probe- patent for approxima tely 2 cm where it is tiled with a
soft brown tan protruding tissue (possible tumor). The end of the pancreas which attaches to the
spleen is markedly indurated and exhibits a gray white smooth ill-defined mass (3.0 x 2:5 x 2.0 cm)
abutting the soft tissue margin of resection and is approx imately 4 cm from the pancreatic margin of
resection -.The mass at this point totally occludes the pancreatic duct .The mass occupies
approximately 75% of the pancreas. The random pancreatic parenchyma is lobulated gray tan grossly
unremarkable.
The capsule of the spleen is brown tan and intact"" The cut surface exhibits a soft red brown tissue
with grossly unremarkable parenchyma- Sectioning of the adipose tissue isolates no definitive lymph

A. The specimen is received fresh for frozen section analysis, labeled ""fiver nodule-* The
specimen consists of a 1.0 x 0.5 x 0.1 cm, soft, tan-pink irregular fragment of liver, which is entirely
submitted for frozen section as FSAI.
B. The specimen is received fresh for frozen section analysis labeled ""'Whipple ; specimen is
gallbladder, head of pancreas ,distal stomach, and duodenum -""The specimen consists of a resected portion of head of the pancreas (4.0 x 3.0 x 2.5 cm), the duodenum (12 cm in length and 2 cm in its
greatest diameter), distal stomach (3 cm along the lesser curvature and 6.5 cm along the greater
curvature) ,and attached gallbladder (7.0 x 3. 0 x 2.5 cm) ..The landmarks of the specimen are inked
as follows ;superior mesenteric artery stapled margin of resection yellow, portal vein groove blue,. and
retroperitoneal surface black-
The pancreatic duct is probed-patent up to about 2 cm, at which point it appears to be obstructed by
an ill-defined, indurated pancreatic mass 2.0 x 2.0 x 0.3 cm), grossly coming to within 2 cm of the
pancreatic margin of resection, and 0.5 cm of the radial soft tissue margin. Grossly the mass does not
appear to involve the common bile duct, ampulla of Water, or duodenum- The remainder of the

Comment
Sections through the Ampulla show apancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma secondarily involving the
Ampulla and common bile duct- A precursor lesion for the carcinoma is not identified in the Ampulla,
duodenum or bile duct- The carcinoma, however, is centered on the main pancreatic duct. The
adjancet pancreatic parenchyma hsows PanIN 3. These findings support the interpretation of this as a
pancreatic ductal primary, rather than an Ampullary or common bile duct primary-
Ancil lary T esting
lrnmunohistochemiical stains with appropriate controls were performed on block B9.. These results
show strong and diffuse expression for MUC-I, and no expression for MUG-2 and CDX2. These
results are consistent with a pancreatobiliary phenotype.

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: The liver biopsy (Part A) shows preserved lobular parenchyma. The portal tracts are
expanded by a mild inflammatory infiltrate including neutrophils, mild ductular reaction and edema, with mild periportal
fibrosis confirmed on trichrome and reticulin stains. These features are those of bile duct obstruction. No malignancy is
identified. Iron, PAS, DPAS and Victoria blue stains show no additional pathologic features.
The pancreatic gastroduodenectomy specimen (Part B) shows a moderately differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma
arising in the pancreas and extending into the duodenum. There is also extension of tumor into the peripancreatic
adipose tissue. The tumor comes to within 1 mm of the posterior (black inked) surgical margin (Section B9). There is
perineural invasion as well as tumor invasion within lymphatics, confirmed with D2-40 immunohistochemical stain.
There is also multifocal PanIN. In places, there are papillary structures with significant focal atypia, corresponding to
PanIN3 (section B10); these areas are not present at the resection margin. This supports a pancreatic ductal origin for
this tumor.
1 Page 3 of 4 The green cystic lesion noted grossly corresponds to a reactivefinflammatory, partially cystic process adjacent to the
common bile duct. Many spindled macrophages are present in this area, positive for CD68.. No carcinoma is identified
in this area with cytokeratin stain. No metastatic carcinoma is seen in ten lymph nodes.
The gastroduodenal lymph node (Part C) shows a large reactive lymph node with lipogranulomas. No carcinoma is
identified.
The section of jejunum (Part D) shows unremarkable small bowel with a pedunculated lesion on the serosal surface.
This lesion is composed of bland spindle cells arranged in intersecting bundles and fascicles with prominent vascularity.
The cells stain positively for CD117 ( c-kit), and negatively for SMA and desmin .This is consistent with a
gastrointestinal stromal tumor .The gallbladder is partially autolyzed, but otherwise unremarkable.

specimen is totally submitted in blocks Dl and D2,
Container E is additionally labeled ""hepatic artery lymph
nodes."" The container holds an aggregate of tan fibroadipose
soft tissue fragments loosely measuring 3 x 2 x 0.7 cm. Several
firm lymph node fragments are palpated within the specimen. The
specimen is totally submitted in blocks El and E2,
Container F is additionally labeled ""gallbladder."" The container
holds a cholecystectomy specimen measuring 8 x 3.5 x 2.5 cm. The
serosal surface is pink/tan and smooth with a rough liver bed
resection surface. The mucosa is hemorrhagic, velvety and finely
trabeculated. The wall is uniform 0.2 to 0.4 cm in thickness.
There are no stones. There are scant hemorrhagic luminal
contents. No mucosal or mural lesions are noted.
Block summary:
F1 - resection margin with cystic duct and artery and
representative section from fundus
F2 - representative sections from mid body and neck
Container G is additionally labeled ""pancreaticoduodenectomy
with short stitch at uncinate, long stitch at SMA."" The
container holds a standard Whipple specimen with the following
measurements: distal stomach 7.5 x 5 cm; portion of greater
omentum attached to stomach 11 x 4.5 x 1.5 cm; duodenum 24 cm in
length x 2.5 cm in average diameter (after fixation); pancreatic
head and neck 6 x 4.5 x 4.5 cm. A long stitch marks the
pancreatic margin at the SMA and a short stitch marks the
uncinate process margin. Inking: common bile duct=yellow,
resection margin at pancreatic neck=blue, uncinate
process=black, peripancreatic soft tissue=green.
The serosal surface of the stomach and duodenum is tan and
smooth. The pancreatic head is very firm. Opening the duodenum
reveals erythematous coarse and thickened mucosa at the ampulla. The remainder of the stomach and duodenal mucosa is beige/tan,
unremarkable, and appropriately folded. The pancreas is
sectioned revealing a 4.2 x 4.0 x 4.0 cm white/tan/yellow solid
firm mass occupying most of the pancreatic parenchyma in the
specimen. The mass has areas of necrotic cystic change along the
dorsal pancreatic surface. The tumor constricts the common bile
duct to lumen diameter of 1-2 mm. It comes up'into the ampulla
and undermines the duodenal mucosa. The tumor infiltrates into
the duodenal wall proximal to the ampulla as well, extending up
to and possibly into the submucosa. The tumor does not involve
the pylorus. There is relatively poor demarcation between the
mass and the pancreatic neck. To assess distance to pancreatic
neck margin the resection surface of the neck is inked blue and
sections are taken perpendicular to this surface (true surgical
margin at the neck is superseded by the en face G2 section). The
mass extends to the inked uncinate margin at short stitch and
the margin at the SMA at long stitch. It also abuts
peripancreatic soft tissue. Distance to mucosal margins: stomach
margin 16 cm, duodenal margin 13 cm, common bile duct margin 1.5
cm
A number of firm lymph nodes are identified in the
peripancreatic soft tissue ranging in size from 0.2 to 0.6 cm,
submitted per block summary. Tumor was collected by Tissue
Procurement.

- See comment
Comment:
The findings in specimen C may represent an old calcified
granuloma or possibly an area of fat necrosis.
The frozen section slides for specimen D are reviewed and the
frozen section diagnosis confirmed. The atypical cells are seen
only on the permanent sections for specimen D and, later,
invasive carcinoma is seen in the common bile duct margin in
specimen H.
Microscopic examination of specimen I demonstrates liver with
cirrhosis. The dense bands of fibrosis are outlined by trichrome
and reticulin stains. Prominent peri-cellular fibrosis is also
present. Mildly increased hepatocyte iron is seen on iron stain
in hepatocytes and portal tracts. No significant PAS positive
material suggestive of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency seen on
PASD stain, although abundant PAS-positive material is present
in Kupffer cells, consistent with hepatocyte damage. There is
prominent centrilobular cholestasis with feathery degeneration
suggestive of large duct obstruction. There is also focal
ballooning degeneration and macrovesicular steatosis
involving approximately 10% of the hepatic parenchyma with
prominent Mallory' s hyaline. There is bile ductular
proliferation with portal inflammation consisting predominantly
of lymphocytes with focal interface hepatitis. Lobular
inflammation consisting of neutrophils and lymphocytes is also
present.

Comment :
Grossly, a 4.8 cm tumor is identified that is evenly distributed
between the duodenum and head of pancreas. While there are no
available immunohistochemical stains to reliably distinguish a
primary duodenal adenocarcinoma from a pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma, the tumor morphology (glandular structures
with abundant clear to pink apical cytoplasmic mucin) and the
absence of a precursor lesion within the duodenal mucosa both
favor a pancreatic primary.

Gross Description :Whipple
specimen consisting of stomach, measuring 11.2 x 10 x
3.5 cm with a proximal staple line which measures 10.5 cm, duodenum
measuring 28 cm in length x
3.5-4 cm in diameter to distal staple margin and pancreatic head measuring
7.5 x 7 x 5.5 cm. There is a clear tan mucinous material protruding from
the main pancreatic duct at the neck margin, but the main pancreatic duct
remains probe patent. The common bile duct is 0.7 cm in diameter and is
probe patent through the ampulla. The pancreas is serially sectioned to
reveal a main pancreatic duct which is dilated to 3 cm in diameter, with
clear tan-red mucinous mass, measuring 5.5 x 3.5 x 3 cm inside the duct.
The mass is largely mucinous and cystic with some solid papillary areas and
appears to be encapsulated within the duct throughout the pancreas. It is
approximately 0.5 cm from the closest radial margin (anterior medial
margin). There is an adjacent
area of firm tan-white slightly lobular pancreas, possibly consistent with
chronic pancreatitis. The stomach is covered by smooth tan-red serosa and
opened along the greater curvature to reveal unremarkable mucosa. The
duodenum is covered by focal green-yellow discoloration of the proximal
serosa and is opened to reveal 1 mL of blood clot adherent to the ampulla
with possible mucinous material. The ampulla is 12.5 cm from the proximal
stomach margin and 17 cm from the distal duodenal margin. The greater
curvature fat measures 11 x 3.2 x 2 cm and is serially sectioned and palpated to reveal the presence of no obvious lymph nodes. The lesser
curvature fat measures 5.5 x 5 x 2.5 cm and is serially sectioned and
palpated to reveal the presence of six possible lymph nodes. Gross
sectioning and palpation of the peripancreatic fat reveals the presence of
20 possible lymph nodes, the largest of which measures 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm.

Gross Description :C: Pancreatic mass: Received is one Whipple specimen composed of a
stomach (10.3 x 10 x 0.8 (wall thickness) cm), duodenum (25 cm in length x
4 cm in average diameter), gallbladder (11.5 x 4.5 x 2.2 cm), and pancreas
(5.5 x 4.8 x 2.2 cm). The specimen is submitted with five designated
margins. The long single blue suture is tumor invading the superior
mesenteric vein; the looped blue suture identifies the superior mesenteric
artery margin; the looped black suture identifies the deep radial margin;
the long single black stitch identifies the portal vein margin, and the
pair of double black sutures identifies the pancreatic neck margin.
The stomach has a proximal staple line that measures 8 cm in length. It is
inked black and a representative section is submitted. The lesser
curvature measures 7.5 cm in length, and the greater curvature measures
14.5 cm in length. The serosa is tan and mildly rough but unremarkable.
The attached omental fat measures 8.5 cm in greatest length. The specimen
is opened along the lesser curvature to reveal regular rugae covered by
light tan mucus. The mucosa is tan with a slightly nodular appearance
(average 0.4 cm in diameter). Representative sections of stomach are
submitted.
The pancreas has a rough, yellow, partially cauterized exterior. The neck
margin is inked blue, and the remaining radial margins are inked black.
The five sutures are identified. Perpendicular sections of these margins
are submitted. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a white,
ill-defined, indurated mass in the head of the pancreas that extends toI nearly the entire length of the organ. It measures 5 x 3.5 x 2.2 cm. In
the inferior limit, the lesion is surrounded by yellow, partially fibrotic
pancreatic parenchyma. The ampulla is patent to the common bile duct. The
pancreatic main duct is obstructed by the pancreatic mass. However, it is
patent at the pancreatic neck margin. Representative sections are
submitted.
The duodenum has congested red serosa near the pancreas. It is otherwise
unremarkable. The surgical margin is stapled. It is inked black, removed
and submitted. The specimen is opened adjacent to the mesenteric border to
reveal a 1.5-cm open defect with central ulceration that is located between
the pylorus and the ampulla. The ulcer extends into the pancreas. It
measures 1.1 cm in depth from the surface of the mucosa. It erodes nearly
into the proximal limit of the prominent blue metal stent in the ampulla
that measures 1.3 cm in diameter and 1.3 cm in length. The mucosa
surrounding the ulcerative lesion and the proximal area of the stent is
firm with a slight dusky appearance. There is an adjacent mass next to the
ulcer that measures 1.5 x 0.8 cm to a height of 0.9 cm. It bridges between
the ulcer and the stented bile duct. The mucosa distal to the bile duct is
tan and edematous except for the most distal 11 cm of dusky mucosa.
The gallbladder has red-purple serosa with punctate areas of green. The
attached area is rough with a scant amount of cauterized, yellow-lobular
tissue. It is filled with viscous, red-brown fluid. The cystic duct
measures 1.5 cm in length x 0.5 cm in diameter. There is a small duct that
measures 0.3 cm in length x 0.2 cm in diameter 1.3 cm distal to the neck.
This is either one of two candidate hepatic ducts or the cystic artery. Near the insertion of the common bile duct to the pancreas, there is a
circular defect that measures 0.4 cm in diameter. It is not certain if
this is a surgical defect or if this is another candidate hepatic duct
opening. Representative sections are submitted.
Sixteen possible pancreatic lymph nodes are dissected and range in from 0.5
x 0.3 x 0.3 cm to 2.7 x 1 x 1 cm. They are submitted in toto. Six
possible greater curvature nodes are dissected and range from 0.2 x 0.2 x
0.2 cm to 0.8 x 0.6 x 0.6 cm. They are submitted in toto. No duodenal
lymph nodes were found.

Gross Description :D:Whipple (paired silk prior pancreatic margin, long single silk portal
vein, long single blue SMA margin, looped blue suture deep radial margin):TZ- Z)
Received is a Whipple specimen that comprises a pancreas, duodenum, and
gallbladder. The specimen is oriented by the surgeon with a paired silk
suture designated as prior pancreatic margin, a long single silk suture
designated as portal vein, a long single blue suture designated as superior
mesenteric artery margin, and a looped blue suture designated as deep
radial margin.
The pancreas measures 5.5 x 5.5 x 4 cm. The neck margin is inked blue and
the radial margin is inked black. The pancreas is sectioned to reveal an
ill-defined, indurated, white-yellow mass that measures
3 x 3 x 2.7 cm that abuts and possibly invades the common bile duct, is
less than 0.1 cm to the superior mesenteric artery margin, and less than
0.1 cm to the deep radial margin, less than 0.4 cm to the portal vein
margin, and greater than 2 cm from the pancreatic neck margin. The common
bile duct and pancreatic duct are both probe patent. The remaining
pancreatic parenchyma is tan-yellow with normal lobular architecture.
The duodenum measures 19.5 cm in length x 3.3 cm in diameter and has
smooth, red-purple serosa. Both ends are stapled shut. The staples are
inked and opened to reveal a tan-brown mucosal surface with normal
appearing longitudinal folds. The distal 6.5 cm of duodenum is dark brown
and focally hemorrhagic with a slightly dusky appearance. There is an
ill-defined, erythematous lesion at the opening of the pancreatic duct in the duodenum that measures approximately 2 x 1 cm in circumference. The
remaining duodenal mucosa is unremarkable. No other masses or lesions are
identified.
The gallbladder measures 10.2 x 4.2 x 1.6 cm and has a smooth-to-roughened,
red-tan serosal surface. The gallbladder is opened and is filled with
viscous, red-black bile fluid. A cystic duct remnant is identified and
measures 1.5 cm in length x 0.4 cm in diameter. The serosal surface is
bile-stained and grossly unremarkable. In addition, there is a
crystallized calculus, 1.5 cm in greatest dimension, identified. No masses
or lesions are identified.
The pancreatic duct and common bile duct enter the duodenum at different
locations approximately
1.5 cm apart from each other.
Sectioning through the fat closely reveals five possible lymph nodes. The
largest measures
1.5 cm in greatest dimension
Representative sections are submitted.

indurated mass 3 cm proximal to the ampulla. The proximal duodenal margin is removed entirely en
face and used for frozen section diagnosis and is resubmitted in toto. The pancreas measures 5.8 x 4 x 4
cm. The neck margin is inked blue, and the radial margin is inked black. On sectioning, a 4 x 3.8 x 3-cm,
ill-defined, indurated, white-yellow mass with clear tan, mucinous filled cystic spaces is identified in the
head of the pancreas ,0.6 cm to the neck
margin, approximately 0.2 cm to the ampulla, and focally abuts the Qq L'VY7 lel_-jL1&AJ_)q&13black -inked radial margin ,and grossly extends to the proximal duodenal
margin.
The ill-defined mass surrounds the main pancreatic and common bile ducts;
however, both ducts are probe patent through the ampulla. The common bile
duct contains a blue stent. The ducts appear to enter the duodenum via
adjacent but separate ductal ampullae. Common bile duct at the margin is
dilated at 1 cm in diameter. The main pancreatic duct at the neck margin
is dilated up to 0.6 cm in diameter.
Sectioning through the mass into the duodenum proximal to the ampulla
reveals the mass to extend grossly into the muscularis of the duodenum and
a clear, mucinous, fluid-filled space, 1.4 cm in greatest dimension,
subjacent to the flattened duodenal mucosal area.
Sectioning and palpation of the peripancreatic fat reveals 14 possible
lymph nodes ranging in size from 0.3 cm in greatest dimension up to 1.2 cm
in greatest dimension. Additionally noted is a 4.2 x 3.2 x 0.6-cm, lymph
node versus splenule. All possible lymphoid tissue is submitted.
Representative sections of the largest lymph node versus splenule areld/^

Gross Description :Whipple, FS: Received is a pancreaticoduodenectomy specimen that
consists of duodenum, pancreas, and peripancreatic fat. The duodenum
measures 20.5 cm in length x 4 cm in average diameter. Both ends are
received stapled shut. The serosa is smooth, red, and grossly unremarkable.
The staples are removed and the duodenum is opened to reveal uniformly
dusky brown mucosa in the distal one-third of the specimen. Of note, the
common bile duct and the main pancreatic ducts have two separate ampullae
separated by approximately 0.2 cm. There is a 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.2-cm,
granular, red-tan lesion adjacent to the ampullae. The proximal duodenal
mucosa is significant for several punctate hemorrhages. There is a blue
stent protruding through the common bile duct ampulla.
The pancreas measures 10 x 6 x 4 cm. The specimen is oriented as follows:
looped blue at portal vein groove, long blue stitch at superior mesenteric
artery margin, and long single black stitch at deep radial margin. The
entire radial margin of the pancreas is inked black. The neck is shaved en
face and used for frozen section diagnosis and is resubmitted in toto. The
new ""untrue"" pancreatic neck margin is inked orange for orientation. The
specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a 3.8 x 3 x 3-cm, ill-defined,
indurated, yellow-white mass that focally abuts the black-inked radial
margin and grossly extends into the peripancreatic fat. The mass is 0.6 cm
from the pancreatic neck margin and 0.5 cm from the ampulla. In the mid
portion of the specimen, the mass surrounds and compresses the main
pancreatic duct to a diameter of 0.1. The main pancreatic duct is probe patent through the ampulla. Similarly, the mass centrally compresses the
common bile duct that is probe patent, through the blue stent, to the
ampulla. Distally, both the main pancreatic and the common bile ducts are
dilated. A portion of the tumor is sent to tumor bank and
The peripancreatic fat is carefully dissected to reveal 12 possible lymph
nodes. Representative sections are submitted including all possible lymph
nodes.

Gross Description :Pancreas: Received is a Whipple specimen measuring 17 x 8 x 5 cm,
consisting of duodenum (15 cm in length x 4.5 cm depth) and pancreas (8 x
5.4 x 2 cm). The proximal and distal margins of the duodenum are received
closed. The duodenum is opened to reveal a duodenal mucosa with normal
folding pattern, with the more distal portion of the duodenal mucosa
appearing darker and congested. Additionally, there is a wire mesh stent
protruding from the ampulla for a distance of 1.2 cm.
The pancreas is received with multiple surgical stitchs, a long single
black stitch designates the deep radial margin, a long single blue stitch
designates the portal vein margin, a looped blue stitch designates the
superior mesenteric artery margin, and a looped black stitch designates the
proximal duodenal margin. The proximal duodenal margin near the area of
the looped black stitch is removed and submitted for frozen section. This
tissue is resubmitted entirely. The pancreatic neck margin measures 1.6 x
1.5 cm and is inked orange. The vascular groove is inked blue and the
remaining radial pancreatic margin is inked black. The pancreas is
serially sectioned to reveal a pale tan to white mass that measures 2.7 x
2.2 x 1.6 cm. The mass is 1.4 cm from the SMA margin, 1.2 cm from the
portal vein margin, 3 cm from the deep radial margin, and 1 mm from the
nearest radial margin. The common bile duct is identified and has a
diameter of 0.2 cm. Additionally, the common bile duct is probe patent
through the ampulla. A longitudinal cut is made along the common bile duct
to reveal the aforementioned wire mesh stent. The stent measures 6.3 cm in length and has a diameter of 1.2 cm. A probe is inserted into the main
pancreatic duct at pancreatic neck margin. The main pancreatic duct is not
probe patent and a longitudinal cut made along the duct determines the
lumen is being obstructed by the mass. Of note, representative sections
and frozens were taken of the common bile duct margin, pancreatic margin,
and duodenal margin and are resubmitted entirely. The remainder of the
pancreatic parenchyma is firm, pale tan to yellow with no additional
distinct masses or lesions noted.

Gross Description :Whipple (long black stitch = pancreatic duct margin, blue stitch =
portal vein margin, looped blue = SMA, looped black = deep radial margin):
The specimen consists of a portion of duodenum measuring 22 cm in length x
4 cm in outer diameter with adhered pancreatic tissue measuring 12 x 8 x 5
cm. The pancreatic tissue has a portal vein vascular groove measuring 10
cm in length which is designated by the long single blue stitch. The
proximal duodenal staple line measures 6 cm in length, with adhered
pancreatic tissue within 0.5 cm of the surgical staple line and adhered
pancreatic tissue extending down the length of the pancreatic duodenal
junction. The distal staple line measures 5 cm in length. The pancreatic
duct margin is marked with a long black stitch and is shaved en face for
frozen section (El). Additionally there is a looped blue surgical stitch
designating the SMA margin and a looped black stitch designating the deep
radial margin. The main pancreatic duct measures 0.5 cm in diameter, and
is hemorrhagic in appearance. After the sample is taken for frozen
section, the residual pancreatic neck margin is inked orange, the vascular
groove is inked blue, and the remaining radial margin is inked black. The
common bile duct diameter measures 0.7 cm and a metal surgical stent is in
place extending down through the ampulla into the duodenum. The cystic
duct is identified and is probe patent to the common bile duct. The distal
duodenal margin is inked black as well as the proximal duodenal margin
which are shaved, and the duodenum is opened longitudinally to reveal a
dusky tan-brown mucosal surface with normal appearing folds. There is aID
cl^
0 small segment of pylorus at the proximal margin measuring 1 cm in length.
Additionally there is a small polyp measuring 0.8 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm,
approximately 1 cm away from the distal margin. Additionally approximately
2 cm from the ampulla there is a small 0.3 x 0.3 cm polyp.
The pancreas is serially sectioned to reveal a 6 x 6 x 3 cm lesion with a
tan-white-to-yellow cut surface with several areas of possible necrosis.
The lesion extends up to but not through both the vascular groove margin
and the deep radial margin and comes to within 0.3 cm of the new pancreatic
neck margin. Additionally the lesion appears to be grossly encompassing
the main pancreatic duct as well as the common bile duct. There is a small
amount of residual lobular tan-yellow pancreatic tissue nearest to the
proximal duodenal margin. No other abnormalities or satellite lesions are
identified.
There is a small amount of peripancreatic adipose tissue, which is palpated
for lymph nodes and all possible lymph nodes are submitted

The stage is determined based on the AJCC 7th Edition criteria, where pT(x) indicates that the primary tumor size cannot be assessed, pN1 denotes regional lymph node involvement, and pM is not applicable as there is no mention of distant metastasis in the report. The grade is reported as poorly differentiated based on the histologic features mentioned in the report.",,,

Gross Description :Received is 1 specimen with pancreatic and duodenal tissue
with several sutures present. The duodenum measures 19 cm in length x 3.2
cm in diameter. The serosal surface is smooth, glistening, tan-pink with
cautery artifact. The duodenum is opened longitudinally to reveal
tan-brown mucosa with an ampulla that is 5 cm from the proximal margin, and
is surrounded by a 1.7 x 1 cm red-tan ulcerative lesion.
The pancreas measures 7.5 x 6 x 4.5 cm, and the neck margin is removed en
face and submitted for frozen section diagnosis. The pancreas is sectioned to reveal that the major
pancreatic duct
is obstructed approximately 1.5 cm from the neck margin. There is an
ill-defined, indurated, white-yellow lesion that is 2 x 2.5 x 2.3 cm. The
mass possibly invades the common bile duct, which is friable and
hemorrhagic, and dilated to 1.2 cm in diameter. The common bile duct is
patent through the ampulla. The mass is 1 cm to the neck margin, 0.8 cm to
the long blue (portal vein), 2.8 cm to the long black (SMA), 0.6 to looped
black (deep radial), 0.1 cm to nearest radial margin, and 6 cm to the

Diagnosis
Distal pancreas and spleen, excision -
Poorly differentiated pancreatic adenocarcinoma, extending into
peripancreatic soft tissues (see microscopic description).
Carcinoma extends at least near to outer resection margin, but not
definitively identified at outer margin. Proximal margin negative for
high-grade dysplasia and carcinoma (see microscopic description).
Spleen without specific diagnostic abnormalities.
Metastatic adenocarcinoma in one of twelve (1/12) lymph nodes.
Microscopic Description:
The following template summarizes the findings in this case:
Histologic type: Adenocarcinoma. The specimen also has dilated ducts
lined by mucinous epithelium, including in the grossly separate cyst
submitted in blocks A3 & A4, compatible with (branch duct-type)
intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN). See note below.
Histologic grade: Poorly differentiated
Primary tumor: pT3.Carcinoma extends intoperipancreatic soft

Yu
Margins of resection: Carcinoma extends at least near to the inked
outer margin, but is not definitively identified at this margin. There
is IPMN at the proximal margin, but it appears low grade at the margin,
without high grade dysplasia or carcinoma identified at the proximal
margin.
Regional lymph nodes: pNl .There is metastatic adenocarcinoma in one
of twelve (1/12) lymph nodes, with the positive lymph node in block
#14.
Distant metastasis: Not applicable
Vascular invasion: Not definitively identified
Other findings: There is perineural invasion by carcinoma, including in
areasthat grossly appeared normal (block #5). The spleen is without
specific diagnostic abnormalities.
Note: It is uncertain if the poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma has
arisen from the IPMN, or if the IPMN is an incidental finding in the
background. This case has been reviewed in Intradepartmental
Consultation, with essential concurrence with the interpretation, with
most reviewers favoring the IPMN is incidental.

Clinical Information
PRE-OP DIAGNOSIS: Pancreatic cancer Gross Description
Received fresh in a container labeled ""distal pancreas, spleen"" is a 9
x 5.5 x 3.5 cm portion of distal pancreas, which attached 110 g, 10 x
7.8 x 3.5 cm, spleen. The surface of the spleen is gray-tan and
wrinkled, and on cut surface it is dark red, smooth, and glistening,
with diffuse white stippling, without gross abnormality. There are a
few areas on the hilar surface of the spleen, approximately 2 cm in
greatest dimension, where the capsule is absent. The pancreas has a
stapled margin proximally. The staples are removed and this surface is
inked black. The remainder of the surface of the pancreas is inked
blue. A firm masscan be palpated from the outer aspect of the
specimen. The specimen is sectioned, and there is a white-tan ill
circumscribed mass 4.5 x 3.7 x 2.7 cm. The mass is 3 cm from the
proximal resection margin, and 3.5 cm from the spleen. The pancreatic
duct can be traced on cut surface to the tumor, but cannot be probed.
The pancreatic duct appears to be markedly stenotic and possibly
obliterated through the area of the tumor. The pancreatic duct lining
is inked green for identification purposes. There is some residual
normal appearing tan pancreatic tissue grossly identified outside of
the mass. There is an apparent cystic structure near, but not clearly
at, the proximal margin of the specimen, 0.7 cm in greatest dimension.
This cyst is 0.2 cm from the pancreatic duct. There are a few tan
lymph nodes identified in the surrounding adipose tissue. RS-15,
following fixation.
BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 - vascular margin; 2 - spleen; 3,4 - entire pancreatic
cyst, with block 3 including adjacent pancreatic duct margin; 5 -
grossly normal pancreatic tissue; 6-11 - tumor, including relation to
the pancreatic duct and outer margin; 12-14 - lymph nodes; 15 -
additional tissue from proximal pancreatic margin.

F/S TAT: 33 mins.
Gross Description:
Received are four containers, all labeled with the patient's name
Part A is received fresh for frozen section diagnosis and additionally labeled
'Whipple specimen, long black=uncinate, short black=pancreatic neck, blue=bile
duct.""
Specimen (components and dimensions): The specimen is the product of a Whipple
resection, previously sectioned, consisting of a 13.2 x 3.0 cm duodenum with
pancreatic head 4.7 cm in length and additional dimensions of 5.6 x 5.5 cm.
Gallbladder: The gallbladder is submitted as a separate specimen (see part
B).
Specimen inking pattern: Uncinate/retroperitoneal/posterior black, vascular
groove red, anterior-blue. (Please note the specimen has been previously inked
in focal areas: The bile duct inked blue, uncinate inked yellow, neck inked
black.)
Tumor:
Location: Pancreatic head
Size: 3.1 x 2.1 x 1.1 cm
Appearance: The tumor is white-tan to tan with ill defined borders and a
decrease in lobular architecture. The tumor is also firm. Gross impression of invasive growth: There is a biliary stent present in the
bile duct. After removal, the tumor appears to abut and obstruct the bile duct.
The tumor appears to possibly abut the main pancreatic duct, however, there does
not appear to be any gross involvement and the pancreatic duct is of the usual
caliber. The tumor also appears to abut, but not grossly penetrate through the
vascular groove. Please defer to microscopic diagnosis.
Resection margins (closest):
Proximal duodenum or stomach: 2.1 cm
Distal duodenum: 7.4 cm
Bile duct: 2.9 cm
Pancreatic neck/duct: 2.3 cm
Uncinate/Retroperitoneum: 1.1 cm
Other findings: The attached portion of duodenum has a pink-tan to brown,
smooth and roughened serosal surface. There'appears to be a 1.1 x 0.8 cm
transmural defect located 5.4 cm from the proximal end. Upon opening the
duodenum, the mucosa is pink-tan with the normal mucosal folds. The area of
transmural defect seems to the area opposing where the bile duct stent was
located .This could be a possible area of local trauma .There are two lesions
present on the duodenal mucosal surface. The first lesion is approximately 2.6
cm from the proximal duodenal margin. This lesion is concerning for possible
tumor. The lesion appears separate from the ampulla, located on the posterior
wall of the duodenum. This lesion has dimensions of 1.4 x 1.4 x 0.4 cm. The
lesion is pink-tan with raised borders with a central ulcerated area.
Representative sections of the first lesion are placed in cassettesAl 4 and Al 5.
The second lesion in the duodenum is approximately 4.6 cm from the proximal
surface, also located on the posterior wall of the duodenum. This lesion has
dimensions of 1.4 x 1.3 x 0.8 cm. This lesion is pink-tan with a smooth surface.
The cut surface of this lesion is yellow-tan and homogeneous. Representative
sections of this lesion are placed in cassettes Al 6 and All.
The bile duct is removed and submitted for frozen section diagnosis (FSA1). The
tissue is resubmitted for permanent section in cassette Al. The uncinate margin
is shaved off and submitted for frozen section diagnosis (FSA2 )and this tissue
is resubmitted for permanent section in cassette A2. The pancreatic neck is
shaved off and submitted for frozen section diagnosis (FSA3 )and this tissue is
resubmitted for permanent section in cassette A3.

Part B is received in formalin additionally labeled ""gallbladder"" and consists
of a gallbladder with overall dimensions of 5.9 x 2.5 x 1.7 cm. The surface is
purple-tan, smooth to roughened. There is a pericystic duct lymph node
identified, having a greatest dimension of 0.6 cm. Opening of the gallbladder
reveals a moderate amount of yellow-green markedly viscid bile. There are no
choleliths identified. The mucosa is pink-tan to brown with focal yellow
stippling. The thickness of the gallbladder wall is 0.3 cm. The cystic duct is
probe patent and appears slightly thickened. The usual sections are submitted in
a single cassette to include the pericystic duct lymph node.
Part C is received in formalin additionally labeled ""portal lymph node"" and
consists of one pink-tan irregular fragment of soft tissue, having dimensions of
1.3 x 0.8 x 0.3 cm. The specimen is submitted in toto in cassette C.
Part D is received in formalin additionally labeled ""SMA tissue"" and consists of
two pink-tan irregular fragments of soft tissue, having dimensions of 1.6 x 0.7

END OF REPORT
Taken: DOB: Gender: M"," Site: Pancreas, Duodenum, Gallbladder, and Multiple Lymph Nodes
Laterality: Not provided
Histology: Adenocarcinoma involving pancreas and duodenum, adenoma of gallbladder
Stage: Not determined in the report
Grade: Not provided
Behavior: Malignant (due to the presence of invasive adenocarcinoma)

Justification: The report mentions ""representative sections of tumor"" and ""mass to vascular groove,"" indicating a malignant process, likely adenocarcinoma, in the pancreas. Additionally, the duodenal lesion is described as having a cut surface that is yellow-tan and homogeneous, which can also be indicative of neoplasia or malignancy. The gallbladder contains a moderate amount of markedly viscid bile, which could suggest the presence of a pathological process such as cholecystitis or a gallbladder tumor. However, the report does not provide enough information to determine the stage or grade of these lesions.",,,

Pancreatic notch surface: Red.
The common bile duct extends 1.3 and 0 .9 cm in diameter ,with a probe patent lumen into the small
bowel segment .The pancreatic duct is unable to probe for patency with the CBD or small bowel lumen.
The distal pancreatic margin is trimmed and submitted en face for frozen section analysis on one chuck
with the residual frozen tissue submitted in Al for permanent sections ;the common bile duct margin is
trimmed and submitted en face for frozen section analysis on a second chuck with the residual frozen
tissue submitted in A2 for permanent sections.
The gastric and small bowel segments are now opened ;the luminal contents are cleared revealing
semi-congested ,light pink to proximally deep red, gastric mucosa without discrete lesion .The small bowel
segment demonstrates prominent ,light pink and tan, circular plica that is increasingly softened and
congested toward the distal margin of resection .The ampulla of Vater is oriented 5.3 cm distal to the
pylorus and greater than 18.0 cm from the distal small bowel margin of resection .The ampulla
demonstrates slightly raised and granular appearance .Initial sectioning through the pancreas reveals an
ill-defined ,dense ,grossly fibrotic ,light gray and pink, mass lesion ,measuring upwards of 3.0 x 2 .3 x 1.8
cm, and predominantly positioned in the superior-posterior aspect of the pancreas ,within 0 .1 cm of the
superior ,0.3 cm of the posterior ,0.7 cm of the anterior margins, and within 0 .1 cm of the surface of the
pancreatic notch. The mass lesion appears to abut the common bile duct ,however ,the mucosa is
glistening to wrinkled, light gray and deep red, without gross involvement .The lesion is grossly within 0.1
cm of the distal pancreatic margin ,formally removed for frozen section analysis .The pancreatic duct
narrows to 0.1 cm towards the small bowel length and is possibly obliterated by tumor .The grossly
uninvolved pancreas demonstrates a pronounced ,lobular -glandular ,pink yellow gross architecture, that
becomes increasingly fatty towards the inferior anterior periphery.
Initial examination of the peripancreatic fat reveals twelve lymph node candidates ranging from 0.15 cm
to 1.5 cm, rubbery ,light gray to deep red. Initial examination of the perigastric fat does not reveal
additional lymph node candidacy .Representative sections are submitted for microscopic evaluation.

The report provides a gross description of a surgical pathology specimen, including the pancreas and gallbladder. The pancreatic specimen shows an ill-defined, dense, fibrotic mass with possible involvement of the pancreatic duct and abutment of the common bile duct. The gallbladder is described as previously disrupted and partially deflated, with erythematous submucosa. Based on these findings, the behavior is most likely malignant.

Pancreatic head anterior margin yellow, main pancreatic ductred, uncinate margin green , vascular notch margin indigo, commonbile duct margin blue, posterior pancreatic margin black, and
the mucosa of the common bile duct orange.
Size, appearance , and location of tumor: The tumor is located
within the head of the pancreas .Its site of origin appears to
be adjacent to the ampulla of Vater within the parenchyma of the
pancreas itself and measures 1.9 cm anterior to posterior, 2.8
cm superior to inferior. The tumor appears to efface the normalmorphology of the normal yellow lobulated pancreas and is
replaced by a vague dull gray pale tan appearance with
ill-defined and vague borders.
Gross impression of invasive growth: The tumor does not appearto grossly involve the bile duct or the pancreatic ducts and
appears limited to within the pancreatic parenchyma showing no
gross involvement with the duodenal mucosa and appears to abutthe ampulla.
Closest resection margins and distance :The ampulla, within 0.3cm, the anterior margin within 0.3 cm.
Other findings :the tumor is free of the uncinate ,vascular andmain pancreatic duct margin and shows no gross involvement withthe common bile duct margin.
Uninvolved tissues :Soft to rubbery, yellow lobulated pancreaswith normal caliber ducts throughout the pancreas. The
gallbladder is red -brown, heavily congested with a smoothserosa ,0.3 to 0.6 cm thick walls and bile-stained green,
velvety mucosal surfaces filled with green mucoid and viscousbile showing no calculi. The cystic duct 0.2 cm in diameter andshowing no gross evidence of tumor. The stomach shows heavilydenuded mucosal surfaces corresponding with gastritis and the
duodenum is of normal tan-brown tightly folded mucosa showing nofocal lesion.
Lymph nodes attached :There are three within the pericommonbile duct region, five within the posterior peripancreatic softtissue , nine within the anterior peripancreatic soft tissue and
four within the gastro -omentai soft tissue of the greater
curvature with the lymph nodes ranging from 0.3 to 2.2 cm in
greatest dimension, the largest near the pericommon bile ductregion.

g2rossDescription:
A. The specimen is labeled gallbladder, total pancreatectomy and is received without fixative. It consists
of a composite resection which consists of a wedge of gastric tissue measuring 9 x 6.5 x 2.5 cm and a 30
cm segment of duodenum. Attached to the duodenum is a total pancreatectomy specimen with a
palpable mass at the head of the pancreas. The pancreas overall is 19 cm in length, 6.5 cm from superior
to inferior and approximately 4.8 cm from anterior to posterior. Blue ink is applied to the superior edge of
the pancreas ,orange ink to the posterior lateral surface ,red Ink is applied to the pancreatic notch, and
black ink is applied to the posterior/uncinate portion of the pancreas. Green ink is applied along the
anterior surface. The free serosal surface of the gastric resection and the duodenum is pale red and
smooth.
The specimen is opened to reveal darkly hemorrhagic gastric mucosa with a rugose pattern extending to
the pylorus. The pylorus has a prominent appearance but there is no ulceration or abnormality at the
pylorus. 7 cm distal to the pylorus, the ampulla is identified and a probe is extended through the ampulla
to located the common bite duct. The surgical margin of the common bile duct is removed and submitted
for frozen section as FS1. Serial sections of the head of the pancreas reveal a gritty, tan-white, relatively
well-circumscribed neoplasm which measures 5 cm from medial to lateral, 4.5 cm from superior to inferior,
and 3.3 cm from anterior to posterior.
It is 9 cm from the proximal gastric margin and 14 cm form the distal duodenal margin. It is 1.3 cm from
the ampulla, 0.2 cm from the closest anterior margin, 1.5 cm from the superior margin, and very close
proximity to the pancreatic notch margin (inked red) and within 0.2 cm of the closest posterior/uncinate

margin. In the superior peripancreatic tissue just adjacent to the bile duct, there is a fluid-filled,
thin-waited 0.7 cm cyst. Sectioning of the remainder of the pancreas reveals fibrotic yellow-tan to
tan-white parenchyma with scattered fluid-filled cysts which are up to 0.7 cm. The duodenum is up to 5.5
cm maximally, The distal 8 cm of the duodenum has dark red hemorrhagic mucosa. There are no mucosal
polyps identified. The perigastric adipose tissue and peripancreatic tissue are dissected for possible nodes.
Also in the specimen container is an intact gallbladder which is 7.7 cm in length and 3.8 cm in diameter.
The serosal surface is pale violet and smooth. The cystic duct is narrow but patent. The gallbladder well is
up to 0.3 cm in thickness. The mucosa is yellow and velvety with spotty yellow mucosal stippling. There is
a single 0.3 cm black calculus. Representative sections are submitted

B. The specimen is labeled portal lymph node and is received in formalin. It consists of a 2.5 x 1.8 x 1.3
cm fragment of lobutated fatty tissue. On dissection two possible nodes are recovered ranging from 1.4 - I
cm. The larger possible node is serially sectioned and is submitted in cassette 131, the smaller node is
serially sectioned and submitted in cassette B2.
Microscopic Description:
A. Sections of the Whipple procedure show an invasive, moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. The
tumor forms irregular angulated and abortive glands with nuclear enlargement, marked nuclear size
variability and prominent nucleoli. The tumor focally extends into the peripancreatic adipose tissue and is
present at the cauterized pancreatic notch margin. The tumor is 2.0 mm from the posterior margin and all
remaining margins are uninvolved. A focus of lymphovascular invasion is present but no diagnostic

component is confined within the pancreas and no increased mitotic activity is present.
immunohistochemistry for neuroendocrine markers C056, chromogranin and synaptophysin performed on
block Al 0 highlights the neuroendocrine component. The neuroendocrine component and ductal
adenocarcinoma are both highlighted by immunohistochemistry for cytokeratin 7.
A total of seven lymph nodes are identified, of which three are positive for malignancy. One lymph node
metastasis is highlighted by immunohistochemistry for OSCAR-cytokeratin (block A8).
Additional findings include extensive chronic pancreatitis with variable ductal dilatation and
intraepithelial neoplasia which ranges from low-grade to high grade (PanlN 111). Adjacent benign
mesothelial cysts are present. There is mild gastritis but the stomach is otherwise unremarkable. The
gallbladder has mild chronic cholecystitis with foamy histiocytes in the mucosa. Within the pancreas, there
is a focus with dense eosinophilic change. Congo red special stain for amyloid is negative.
B. The sections of the portal lymph node specimen show two benign lymph nodes (012). No malignancy is
identified.

gallbladder which is 11 cm in length and up to 3 .8 cm in diameter. The free serosal surface is red-violet
and smooth .The cystic duct is patent and there are two firm pale tan cystic duct nodes which are up to 0.6
cm in maximum dimension. The gallbladder wall is generally 0.5 cm in thickness .The mucosa varies from
yellow -tan to pale red and is finally granular throughout .There is partial septation of the gallbladder neck
as well as an area of septation at the fundus .No calculi are present .There are no palpable nodules within
the gastric wall. Representative sections re submitted. Section summary: 131) cystic duct margin ,cystic ductnodes ,gallbladder neck ,B2) gallbladder body and fundus.^
C. The specimen is labeled portal lymph node and consists of a 2 x 1 .9 x 0.8 cm fragment of yellow-tan to
pale red tissue .On sectioning there is a single lymph node measuring approximatelyl.3 cm in maximum
dimension. The node is sectioned and touch imprints are obtained. The specimen is entirety submitted In
cassette Cl.
D. The specimen is labeled Whipple procedure and is received without fixative. It consists of a composite
resection of tissue which includes a 5 x 3 x 1.8 cm wedge resection of distal gastric tissue including pylorus
and a 27 cm segment of duodenum. There is a firm portion of pancreatic head which measures 6.3 x 4.7 x
5 cm. The anterior superior surface of the pancreas is inked blue, the anterior-inferior surface is inked
green ,and the posterior surface is inked black.

surface of the distal duodenum is tan with some slight surgical disruption but there are no areas of
perforation .The specimen is opened to reveal the gastric mucosa is flat ,tan to pale red, slightly granular.
There is some slight irregularity of the mucosa at the pylorus but no true ulceration. The circumference at
the proximal duodenum is 6 cm .The ampulla is located 10 cm distal to the pylorus (11.5 cm from
proximal margin and 17 cm from the distal margin ).A wire stent protrudes from the ampulla .Sectioning of
the pancreas along the common bile duct reveals gritty tan-white ,firm, poorly delineated neoplastic tissue
in the head of the pancreas measuring .2.8 cm in maximum dimension .This neoplastic process grossly
appears to be 1.8 cm from the ampulla .The pancreatic resection margin and the bile duct are marked
with sutures ..Sectioning reveals that the neoplasm is grossly 1.3 cm from .the pancreatic resection margin.
The neoplasm is in close proximity to the anterior -superior surface as well as the anterior -inferior surface. It
is grossly 0.3 cm from the closest posterior pancreatic surface .Further sectioning of the pancreas reveals a
prominent diverticulum -like out -pouching of the duodenum 2 cm proximal to the ampulla. This
diverticular out pouching grossly extends into the head of the pancreas but does not appear to have
neoplastic involvement .The pancreas tissue away from the neoplasm is firm and yellowish. There are
scattered peripancreatic nodes which are up to 2.5 cm .The penpancreatic tissue is dissected for further
nodes.
Just distal to the ampulla, the circumference of the duodenum is 7 cm and at the distal duodenal margin
circumference is 5.5 cm .The duodenal mucosa is yellow -tan with normal appearing mucosal folds and no
palpable areas of nodularity are present within the duodenal wall. There is very little duodenal adipose
tissue present .The pancreatic resection margin is removed as a thin shave and submitted for frozen
section as FSD1.

Gross Description:
A. Part A designated gallbladder. Received in formalin is a previously disrupted, deflated gallbladder. 7.8
x 3.2 x 1.2 cm. The serosa is glistening, fatty pink and tan. There are two paracysitc duct lymph node
candidates are 0.3 and 0.4 cm each. The cystic duct margin demonstrates a narrow 1 mm lumen, difficult
to probe for patency, however, upon sectioning does not appear obstructed. The lumen contains a
residual amount of viscous dark green bile without calculi; no calculi are present within the container. The
mucosa Is velvety, dark green with few raised yellow flecks without grossly unusual areas of change
suggestive of neoplasla. Representative sections are submitted for microscopic evaluation, including
representation of the cystic duct margin (orange), lymph node, mid fundus and dome of fundus in A1.
B. Part 8 designated common bile duct lymph node. Received In formalln is a rubbery pink and tan lymph
node candidate measuring 1,1 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm. The lymph node and surrounding fat Is now bisected and

Part C designated Whipple procedure .Initially received in a fresh state for frozen section analysis Is agenerous portion of tissue ,consistent with a Whipple procedure specimen .Itconsists of a distal portion ofthe antrum of the stomach ,12.0 cm along the greater curvature and 7 .8 cm on the lesser ,and up to 7.0cm in diameter at the proximal surgical margin of resection ;the small bowel is 21.0 cm in length with an
average diameter of 2.5 cm and up to 3.1 cm at the proximity of the pancreatic head ;the pancreasIncludes the head and portion of the body 5.7 cm in length ,5.0 cm Inferior -superor, 4.2 cmanterior -posterior .The common bile duct is obscurred by peripancreatic fat, and extends out to 1.8 cm, ismarkedly narrow ,0.35 cm diameter .The CBD probe patent to a depth of 2.5 cm.
FINAL SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT
AThe gastric and small bowel is now opened ,and examination of the small bowel demonstrates prominent,
semi-congested pink and tan circular plica, with the apparent ampulla of Vater oriented 8 .4 cm distal tothe pylorus ,and Is obscured by a raised ,dusky red lesion measuring 1.3 x 0 .8 cm. The AV through thepancreatic duct is probe patent .Several attempts to probe the AV with the common bile duct Isunsuccessful .The CBD and distal pancreatic margin are submitted for frozen section analysis ,the residualfrozen tissue submitted en (ace for permanent sections .The pancreas is initially bisected through the
ampulla of Vater, towards the distal margin ,revealing a poorly demarcated, dense ,pink-gray tumor massmeasuring upwards of 3.1 x 3 .0 x 2.2 cm, and grossly approaching within 2 .8 cm of the distal margin ofthe pancreas, and 2 .8 cm from the common bile duct margin and grossly approaching within 0.5 cm of the
pancreatic notch/adventitlal margin .The length of the common bile duct is opened ,revealing a light pink
and tan mucosa that is roughly kinked within the head of the pancreas ,and routes parallel to thepancreatic duct and Inserts 0 .3 cm from the pancreatic duct into the ""ampulla of Vater "".The tumor massapproaches within 0 .5 cm of the edge of the CBD .The tumor Is primarily oriented within the head of the
pancreas with discrete contiguous relationship with the ampulla of Vater.
In addition ,2.0 cm proximal to the ampulla of Vater ,the small bowel demonstrates a distinctly raised,granular area of density ,that upon sectioning reveals evidence of an accessory duct with associated
firmness suspicious for tumor (C7-C8). The area appears to grossly approach within 0 .5 cm of the superioredge of the radial surface ,1.0 cm of the posterior surface .0.3 cm of the Inferior surface, and 0 .7 cm of theanterior surface .The surrounding pancreatic parenchyma is admixed fatly and glandular ,pink and tan.
No additional lesions are appreciated along the small bowel length ,however ,the pyloric ridgedemonstrates raised granular changes .The gastric mucosa Is wrinkled ,erythematous light pink and tan,however ,abruptly transitions to severely congested ,deep red-brown throughout the proximal two-thirds ofthe gastric antrum .No additional lesions appreciated.
Initial examination of the peripancreatic fat reveals twenty additional lymph nodes ranging from 0.2 cm -
1.4 x 0.8 x 0.8 cm each .Examination of the lesser and greater gastric fat does not reveal gross lymph
node content .The lymph nodes are entirely submitted for microscopic evaluation, with the specimen
retained In solution to enhance future lymph node ,identification If Indicated.

Justification: The description of a firm, gray-white mass in the pancreas with attached probable lymph nodes suggests a primary tumor, likely originating from the pancreas or ampulla of Vater. However, the specific diagnosis cannot be confirmed without further histological evaluation and immunohistochemical studies.",,,

Gross Description:
A. Part A designated gallbladder. Received in formalin is an intact gallbladder, 8.7 x 2.6 x 2.3 cm. The
serosa is glistening slightly fatty tan-green. The cystic duct margin demonstrates a 1 mm lumen that is
probe patent. The wall is 0.1 cm, and the lumen contains a copious amount of viscous dark green bile
with a few minute particulate and no well formed calculi. The rnucosa is velvety, dark green without
grossly unusual areas of change suggestive of neoplasia. No grossly unusual areas of change are
suggestive of neoplasia. Representative sections are submitted in Al and A2._
B. Initially received in the fresh state for frozen section evaluation is a generous portion of tissue consistent
with a Whipple procedure specimen, The Whipple consists of a generous portion of the antrum of
stomach, 11.0 cm along the greater, 7.2 cm along the lesser curvature, 5.6 cm in diameter at the proximal
margin of resection; the small bowel length is 22.5 cm, 2.5 cm in diameter at the distal margin of
resection and 3.2 cm in diameter near the head of the pancreas; the pancreas is up to 4.8 cm in length,
4.4 cm superior-inferior, and 4.0 cm posterior-anterior. The common bile duct extends 0.5 cm and 0.8 cm
in diameter, with a 0.5 cm patent lumen, A stent protrudes from the bile duct margin. A long silk suture
marks the distal pancreatic surgical margin and demonstrates a 0.25 cm diameter duct that is probe
patent. The pancreatic surfaces/margins are differentially inked as follows: anterior - yellow, superior -
blue, inferior - green, posterior - black and the pancreatic notch marked red.
The stomach is opened along the greater curvature and the length of the small bowel is opened revealing
the ampulla of Vater oriented 7,0 cm distal to the pylorus, slightly raised and granular, dusky red, over an
area of 1.0 x 0.7 cm. The common bile duct is probe patent with the AV. The pancreatic duct inserts into
the small bowel just 0.3 cm inferior to the AV (does not communicate). Sectioning through the head of the
head of the pancreas reveals an ill-defined, mucinous, light gray to admixed yellow, mass lesion within
the superior head of the pancreas, measuring upwards of 3.1 x 2.5 x 2.0 cm. Grossly, the tumor is 1.2 cm
away from the distal pancreatic margin. The tumor is within 0.1 cm of the superior margin, 0.1 cm of the
posterior ( including pancreatic notch), 1.7 cm from inferior, and 0.3 cm from anterior. Near the CBD, there
is a palpable, firm lymph node that is sectioned, revealing a mucinous, dense, light gray appearance. The
bile duct margin, pancreatic margin and lymph node are submitted/represented for frozen section
evaluation. A representative portion of the grossly positive lymph node and possible tumor within the head
of the pancreas is submitted for studies - tumor bank. The tumor partially abuts the small
bowel wall along the superior-anterior head of the pancreas with a single 0.2 cm focus of involvement
through the small bowel muscularis (B7). The tumor partially abuts the CBD, however, the length of the
lumen is wrinkled and light tan without gross invasive tumor. The grossly uninvolved pancreas is
semi-congested-inflamed, lobular, yellow-tan parenchyma, with transient areas of induration-density.
Examination of the peripancreatic fat reveals nineteen lymph nodes ranging from 0.3 cm to 2.0 x 1 .7 x
0.8 cm each, The presence of invasive tumor within the fat makes lymph node identification difficult.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
Specimen is received fresh for frozen section in a single container labeled a distal pancreatectomy specimen with attached spleen. The
specimen is comprised of distal portion of pancreas (9.0 x 9.0 x 3.5 cm), and spleen (12.0 x 8.0 x 4.0 cm). The proximal pancreatic margin is received
stapled. The staple line is removed the underlying parenchyma is inked blue. Bulging from the inferior aspect of the pancreas is a 7.0 x 5.0 x 3.5 cm
previously ruptured cyst- Cyst contents are not present The inner lining is pink-tan and wrinkled. The pancreas is inked black. A representative
section from the proximal pancreatic margin submitted for frozen section with residual entirely resubmitted for permanent section. Further sectioning
through the pancreas reveals a 5.0 x 4.0 x 3.2 cm gray-white indurated mass that approaches to within less than 0.1 cm of the superior, inferior, anterior,
and posterior pancreatic surfaces. Additionally, this mass abuts the aforementioned cyst. The cysts grossly communicates with the main pancreatic
duct. No normal appearing pancreatic parenchyma is identified. This mass approaches to within 1.5 cm of ttie sptenic hilum which is grossly uninvolved.
On section and palpation, two possible peripancreatic lymph nodes are identified near the stapled margin.They are 0.5 and 0.7 cm in greatest
dimension-No lymph nodes are identified at the splenic hilum. The spleen weighs 154 grams and features an intact purple-gray capsule. Sectioning
reveals a beefy red glir'-ni- '-"" e'""fnre with punctate white pulp. No masses or lesions are identified. Representative sections are submitted in
cassettes Al -16 labelelesignated as follows: 1 - frozen section residue; 2 - mass to superior pancreas, perpendicular, 3 - mass to
superior pancreas and splenic artery, perpendicular; 4 - mass to inferior pancreas, perpendicular 5 - mass to anterior pancreas, perpendicular; 6

entirety between two sponges bisected In C1.=
D. Part D is pancreaticosplenectomy. Initially received in a fresh state for harvesting tissue for
is a pancreaticospienectomy consisting of spleen, distal pancreas, adrenal gland,
and two attached pieces of stomach. The dimensions of the pancreas is difficult to discern due to
replacement by tumor that invades the surrounding soft tissue; however, is up to 10.0 cm in length and 4.3
x 1.9 cm,
Sectioning through the stapled proximal margin of resection reveals tan pancreatic parenchyma without
gross tumor involvement. Upon sectioning transversely, reveals a well-demarcated tumor mass, grossly 1.8
cm from the pancreatic surgical margin and measuring upwards of 8.0 x 4.3 x 3.5 cm. The tumor mass is
dense, light gray and demonstrates obvious involvement into the peripancreatic soft tissue within 0.2 cm
of the anterior and posterior radial surfaces. The apparent adrenal gland is slightly distorted, measures
upwards of 4.0 x 1.8 x 1.5 cm, and is partially encased and involved by tumor grossly (D11-D12). The
remaining length of the pancreas is grossly involved with tumor with the likely distal end of the tail
demonstrating poorly visualized lobular, yellow-tan fat and possible pancreatic parenchyma (D9-D10,
contiguous sections).
A smaller piece of attached stomach is 4.3 x 1.3 x 0.6 cm, deep red-tan and is incised to reveal
prominently wrinkled, deep tan mucosa without gross tumor involvement (D13): A larger wedge-like piece
of stomach is 5.9 x 2.0 cm and is red-tan with submucosal tumor involvement (D16). The grossly involved
area is greater than 1.0 cm away from the stapled surgical margin. The tumor grossly invades the hilar fat
up to.the spleen and encasing the splenic vessels. The spleen is 8.7 x 7.6 x 3.3 cm with a glistening, deep
purple-tan intact capsule. The spleen is serially sectioned revealing deep red parenchyma without discrete
nodularity or grossly invasive tumor component. Lymph nodes searched within the hilar region and
superior peripancreatic fat is hindered by tumor replacement. Representative sections are submitted for
microscopic evaluation.

A. Sections of the peritoneal biopsy show peritoneum with attached skeletal muscle partially involved by
metastatic adenocarcinoma forming irregular glands with surrounding desmoplastic stroma. No
lymphovascular invasion is identified.
B. Sections of the umbilical nodule show adenocarcinoma involving fibroadipose tissue. The tumor is at
the cauterized edge of the fragment. No lymphovascular invasion is identified.
C. Sections of the liver biopsy show a subcapsular focus of metastatic adenocarcinoma. A portion of
benign liver tissue is present, No lymphovascular invasion is identified,
D. Sections of the pancreaticosplenectomy show an invasive adenocarcinoma involving the tail of the
pancreas. The tumor forms irregular small glands with a surrounding desmoplastic stroma. There is a
minor cord and single cell pattern. The nuclei are enlarged with prominent nucleoli and there is
cytoplasmic mucin. Perineural invasion is present and there is a focus suspicious for lymphovascular
invasion. There are some dilated pancreatic ducts with severe dysplasia and carcinoma in situ. The
invasive tumor invades Into the surrounding peripancreatic soft tissue with involvement of the left adrenal
gland and fibrovascular bundle of the splenic hilum without direct invasion into the splenic parenchyma.
The larger wedge of attached stomach has tumor invading through the wall up to the mucosa. It cannot
be determined if this focus is due to direct extension or metastatic spread. A single benign peripancreatic
lymph node is present. The pancreatic margin is uninvolved.
E. Sections show mesenteric tissue with foci of adenocarcinoma composed of irregular small glands

entirety between two sponges bisected in C1.-
D. Part 0 is pancreaticosplenectomy .Initially received in a fresh state for harvesting tissue for
is a pancreaticosplenectomy consisting of spleen ,distal pancreas ,adrenal gland,
and two attached pieces of stomach. The dimensions of the pancreas is difficult to discern due to
replacement by tumor that invades the surrounding soft tissue; however, is up to 10.0 cm in length and 4.3
x 1.9 cm.
Sectioning through the stapled proximal margin of resection reveals tan pancreatic parenchyma without
gross tumor involvement .Upon sectioning transversely ,reveals a well -demarcated tumor mass, grossly 1.8
cm from the pancreatic surgical margin and measuring upwards of 8.0 x 4 .3 x 3.5 cm. The tumor mass isdense ,light gray and demonstrates obvious involvement into the peripancreatic soft tissue within 0.2 cm
of the anterior and posterior radial surfaces .The apparent adrenal gland is slightly distorted ,measures
upwards of 4.0 x 1.8 x 1.5 cm, and is partially encased and involved by tumor grossly (D11-D12). The
remaining length of the pancreas is grossly involved with tumor with the likely distal end of the tail
demonstrating poorly visualized lobular ,yellow-tan fat and possible pancreatic parenchyma (D9-01 0,
contiguous sections).
A smaller piece of attached stomach is 4.3 x 1.3 x 0.6 cm, deep red-tan and is incised to reveal
prominently wrinkled, deep tan mucosa without gross tumor involvement (D13): A larger wedge-like piece
of stomach is 5.9 x 2.0 cm and is red-tan with submucosal tumor involvement (1) 16). The grossly involved
area is greater than 1 .0 cm away from the stapled surgical margin .The tumor grossly invades the hilar fat
up to.the spleen and encasing the splenic vessels .The spleen is 8.7 x 7.6 x 3.3 cm with a glistening, deep
purple -tan intact capsule .The spleen is serially sectioned revealing deep red parenchyma without discrete
modularity or grossly invasive tumor component .Lymph nodes searched within the hilar region and
superior peripancreatic fat is hindered by tumor replacement. Representative sections are submitted for
microscopic evaluation.

Microscopic Descri ption:
A. Sections of the peritoneal biopsy show peritoneum with attached skeletal muscle partially involved by
metastatic adenocarcinoma forming irregular glands with surrounding desmoplastic stroma. No
lymphovascuJar invasion is identified.
B. Sections of the umbilical nodule show adenocarcinoma involving fibroadipose tissue. The tumor is at
the cauterized edge of the fragment. No lymphovascular invasion is identified.
C. Sections of the liver biopsy show a subcapsuiar focus of metastatic adenocarcinoma. A portion of
benign liver tissue is present ,No lymphovascular invasion is identified.
D. Sections of the pancreaticosplenectomy show an invasive adenocarcinama involving the tail of the
pancreas. The tumor forms irregular small glands with a surrounding desmoplastic stroma. There is a
minor cord and single cell pattern. The nuclei are enlarged with prominent nucleoliand there iscytoplasmic mucin .Perineural invasion is present and there is a focus suspicious for lymphovascular
invasion. There are some dilated pancreatic ducts with severe dysplasia and carcinoma in situ. The
invasive tumor invades into the surrounding peripancreatic soft tissue with involvement of the left adrenal
gland and fibrovascular bundle of the splenic hilum without direct invasion into the splenic parenchyma.
The. larger wedge of attached stomach has tumor invading through the wall up to the mucosa. It cannot
be determined if this focus is due to direct extension or metastatic spread. A single benign peripancreatic
lymph node is present. The pancreatic margin is uninvolved,
E. Sections show mesenteric tissue with foci of adenocarcinoma composed of irregular small glands
surrounded by desmoplastic stroma. No lymphovascular invasion is identified.

the Surgical Number
A:The specimen consists of a single lymph node with a small amount of fatty tissue. The
lymph node measures 2 x 1 x 0.5 cm. The lymph node is bisected and the cut surface is
tan and grossly unremarkable. The two halves of the lymph node are submitted in toto in
Al. The fatty tissue is submitted in A2.
B:The specimen consists of the spleen along with a portion of pancreas. The spleen
measures 15 x 8 x 3.5 cm and the portion of pancreas measures 9 x 5.5 x 2.5 cm. The
pancreas has been painted as follows: anterior surface blue, stapled medial resection
margin orange, and the posterior surface black. Sectioning through the pancreas reveals
a relatively well circumscribed tan slightly whorled appearing mass which measures 4.5 x
2.4 x 1.6 cm. The mass appears to encase the splenic vein and abuts the splenic artery.
The tumor is less than 1 mm from the posterior pancreatic surface. The staples are
carefully removed from the pancreatic resection margin. Minimal pancreatic tissue is
removed with the staples. The mass is located 0.8 cm from the pancreatic resection
margin and 1 cm from the spleen. Sectioning through the tail of the pancreas reveals that
thereare several small cystic structures present at the distal edge of the tumor.
Sections are submitted as follows:
B1-7. perpendicular sections through the pancreatic resection margin. Margin

relationship of the
tumor to the anterior and posterior surgical plane
514-19. sagittal sections taken through the tail of the pancreas showing the cystic
areas
B20-22. sections of the spleen where the tail of the pancreas intersects with the
splenic hilum
Microscopic Description
Sections show a.poorly differentiated ductal adenocarcinoma arising in the tail of the
pancreas .Pancreatic adenocarcinoma in situ (Pan1N 3) is identified at the edge of the
invasive tumor. Thisarea is located 1.1 cm fromthe pancreatic resection margin. Low
grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia i spresent at the pancreatic r esection margin.
The cytomorphology of the lesion is consistent PanIN 2. The invasive component replaces
the tail of the pancreas and extends out into the peripancreatic soft tissue. Invasive
carcinoma is identified at the inked anterior and posterior surfaces of the pancreas.
Within the tail of the pancreas there is also an intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasmmt
(IPMN) identified. Invasive ductal adenocarcinoma is seen surrounding the IPMN. The
invasive component also invades into the wall of the splenic artery and tumor embolus is
present within the lumen of the splenic artery. Six lymph nodes are identified in the
peripancreatic fatty tissue of the tail. Five of the six lymph nodes are positive for
metastatic ductal adenocarcinoma.

coritainer is designated "" Gallbladder"" and consists of an unopened gallbladder, measuring
11.0 cm in length x 5.0 x 3.5 cm. The outer peritoneal surface is smooth and
unremarkable. The lumen contains green mucoid bile as well as an oval, slightly lobulated
gallstone, measuring 2.7 x 1.6 x 1.5 cm. On fracturing the stone has a typical
crystalline appearance of a cholesterol stone. The mucosa shows a focal sessile polypoid Page 3 of 4
area, 0.4 cm in greatest dimension, but is otherwise velvety and smooth and the
gallbladder wall has athickness of 0.2 cm.A small cystic duct lymph node, 0.7 cm in
greatest dimension is present adjacent to the cystic duct resection margin. Sections are
taken as follows:
Al. resection margin with cystic duct lymph node as well as section from fundus
A2. sections of body with small polypoid protrusions
B. Specimen is received in formalin .The container is designated as "" BA node"" and
consists of a old fragment of firm, grey tan tissue, measuring 2.0 x 1.1 x 0.6 cm.
Bisected and submitted in tato in one cassette.
C. The specimen is received fresh and is subsequently placed into formalin. The
container is designated as "" Whipple specimen "".Thisconsists of a
pancreaticoduodenectomy specimen, the segment of distal stomach and small bowel,
measuring 17.0 cm in length .The head of pancreas measures approximately 5.0 x 4.5 x 3.5
cm. The neck of the pancreas is painted blue, the uncinate process margin is painted
orange. The mucosa of the duodenum is unremarkable with no tumor. The ampulla of eater is
unremarkable .The common bile duct is opened in the fresh state revealing a branching at
the superior edge of the pancreas where the cystic duct joins the common hepatic duct.
The common bile duct ,measures 3.5 cm in length. The attached portion of cystic duct,
measures 2.7 cm and the attached portion of common hepatic duct, measures approximately
1.0 cm. the mucasal surface of the ducts are unremarkable. A coronal section into the
head of pancreas reveals a firm tumorish massoccupying much of the head of pancreas,
with dimensions of 3.2 x 2.5 x 2.0 cm. The tumor appears to approach close to the
inferior and uncinate margins, but small portion of pancreatic tissue superior to the
tumor and extending to the pancreatic neck resection margin has a fibrous cons istency.
The section of soft tissue around the head of pancreas reveals scatter lymph nodes.
Sections are taken as follows:
Cl. proximal resection margin common bile duct
C2.. proximal resection margin cystic duct
C3. pancreatic neck resection margin, en face
C4--6. sections of ampulla of Vater with underlying tumor
C7-10. tumorincluding uncinate margin and posterior soft tissue margin

Microscopic Description
A.Sections show mild acute and chronic inflammation involving the gallbladder with
focal polypoid protrusions in the mucosa bed without any evidence of dysplasia or
malignancy. The cystic. duct lymph node shows slight granulomatosis and is negative for
malignancy.
B.Sections show lymph node tissue with lipogranulomatosis. There is no evidence of
malignancy.
C.There is an invasive well to moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma involving much
of the head of the pancreas. The carcinoma invades through the muscularis propria in the
vicinity of the common bile duct, but does not reach the duodenal mucosa. The common
bile duct mucosa is partly effaced by the invasive carcinoma. The tumor shows prominent
perineurai invasion and extends into peripancreatic adipose tissue. The tumor lies close
to the uncinate resection margin, but there is a narrow rim of fatty tissue with a clear
margin of approximately 0.2 cm. The posterior retroperitoneal margin is clear as well.
The pancreatic neck margin shows prominent fibrosis with loss of pancreatic tissue or Page 4 of 4
chronic pancreatitis, possibly related to the development of carcinoma. No
calcifications are present. The section from the proximal bile duct and cystic duct
margins show mild inflammation and reactive changes, but no sign of dysplasia or
malignancy.
The carcinoma invades directly intotwo peripancreatic lymph nodes regarded as positive
for nodal involvement ,although distant lymph nodes do not show tumor.

Gross Description
Received are specimen containers A to H .All requisitions and specimen containers are
labelled with the patient 's na a.,. cassettes and are
labelled with the
A.Specimen is received fresh and subsequently fixed in formalin. The container is
designated ""gallbladder"". The specimen consists of a collapsed gallbladder with abundant
fatty tissue around the gallbladder. The gallbladder measures 7.C cm in length and up to
2.5 cm in transverse diameter. On opening the gallbladder it contains a small amount of
mucoid bile as well as small fragments of calculus material ranging from 0.2 cm up to 0.8
cm.The mucosal surface is green and velvety. The gallbladder wall measures up to 0.2
cm in thickness. A cystic duct lymph node is visible at the proximal resection margin.
The proximal resection margin and cystic duct lymph node are submitted in Al.
Representative sections from the body and fundus are submitted in A2.
B.Specimen is received fresh and subsequently fixed in formalin. The container is
designated ""Whipple's specimen"". The specimen consists of a pancreatic duodenectomy
specimen .The duodenal portion measures 32.0 cm in length with a short segment of distal
antrum, 2.0 cm in length. The head of pancreas measures 6.0 cm from superior to
inferior, 3.5 cm from medial to lateral and approximately 3.5 cm in thickness from
anterior surface to retroperitoneal resection margin. The superior mesenteric vessel Page 3 of 4
groove is painted green and the protruding uncinate process is painted orange. The
retraper:i.r..oneal soft tissue margin is painted black.The resection margin at the neck of
the pancreas is painted blue. The ampulla of Vater is somewhat protuberant, measuring
1.5 cm across with mucosal congestion. The gallbladder is layed open to reveal a firm
tumorous mass encircling the common bile duct starting 0.8 cm from the opening of the
ampulla and extending out the common bile duct for a distance of 2.0 cm. The remaining
proximal common bile duct is 2.5 cm from the proximal extent of the mass. There is a
bifurcation, likely representing a low insertion of the cystic duct. The bifurcation
lies 1.5 cm from the proximal common bile duct margin. An incision from the uncinate
process aspect at the head of pancreas shows a hard tumorous mass that occupies
approximately 50% of the head of pancreas measuring 3.0 cm from superior to inferior,
approximately 2.0 cm from the wall of the common bile duct in a medial-lateral
orientation and approximately 2.5 cm in thickness in AP orientation. The tumor appears
to lie closest to the retroperitoneal resection margin although soft friable. fatty tissue
is present at the surface. The section of the soft tissue around the head of the
pancreas yields a distinct node at the proximal end of the common bile duct, two lymph
nodes along the superior edge of the head of pancreas, approximately four enlarged firm
areas, possibly nodes, in the adipose tissue attached to the distal stomach,
approximately four lymph nodes in the gastroduodenal zoneand approximately three lymph
nodes in the fatty tissue at the inferior aspect at the head of pancreas.
Sections are taken as follows:
21 - proximal common bile duct resection margin.
B2 - resection margin at neck of pancreas
B3 - :inferior edge at head of pancreas, perpendicular.
84 through B7 - transverse sections of posterior aspect of pancreatic head from interior
to superior.
B8 through B13 - transverse sections of anterior half of head of pancreas from inferior
to superior.
B14 - lymph node at proximal end of common bile duct.
B15 - lymph nodes at superior edge of head of pancreas.
816 and B17 - lymph nodes an lesser curve of stomach.
B18 and B19 - gastroduodenal lymph nodes.
B20 - lymph nodes at inferior edge at head of pancreas.
1321 - representative section of proximal resection margin, perpendicular.
B22 - distal resection margin, perpendicular.
Microscopic Description
A.Sections show gallbladder tissue with chronic cholecystitis, but no cytologic atypia
in the mucosa of the gallbladder. The cystic duct lymph node shows accumulation of
macrophages with areas of hyalinization, but without significant mineral oil
lipogranulomatosis. No sign of malignancy is present.
B.Sections of the head of pancreas shows an invasive moderate to poorly differentiated
pancreatic duct adenocarcinoma that invades along the distal common bile duct, extends
through the wall adjacent duodenum and involves the orifice of the ampulla of Vater. The
bulk of the cancer, however, lies in the inferior part of the head of the pancreas
focally extending to a cauterized inferior margin and focally to a cauterized edge in the
groove of the superior mesenteric vessels. There is also areas of lymphovascular
invasion and perineural invasion.Focal residual ducts on the periphery of the cancer
shows changes of PANIN grade II. The pancreatic neck resection margin is clear and no
clear involvement of the main pancreatic duct can be seen. Also, the secondary
pancreatic papilla is visualized with no direct invasion by cancer. The proximal
resection of the common bile duct is clear of tumor. Multiple lymph nodes included in
the sections of the head of the pancreas shows metastatic carcinoma and together with
additional lymph nodes dissected separately, there appears to be up to 19 lymph nodes,
including the nodes in the distal perigastric tissue. Sixteen of these show either Page 4 of 4

Histology: Moderate to poorly differentiated pancreatic duct adenocarcinoma
Stage: The stage is not explicitly mentioned, but based on the involvement of the pancreas, common bile duct, ampulla of Vater, and multiple lymph nodes, it is likely to be advanced stage (III or IV)
Grade: Moderate to poorly differentiated
Behavior: Malignant, as it is an invasive adenocarcinoma with metastasis to peripancreatic lymph nodes

Justification: The description provides details of the pancreatic head resection and identifies a moderately to poorly differentiated ductal adenocarcinoma invading the distal common bile duct, adjacent duodenum, and ampulla of Vater. Additionally, there is evidence of lymphovascular and perineural invasion, as well as metastasis to multiple peripancreatic lymph nodes.

Pathologist Comment
Although grossly it appeared as though adrenal tissue was present, this could not be
confirmed with certainty on histology. Numerous pigment laden cells with an epithelioid
morphology were identified adjacent to the tumor,. but these are believed to represent
macrophages rather than adrenal cortical cells.

A.Specimen is received fresh. 'rne container is designated ""Gallbladder"". The specimen
consists of a cholecystectomy specimen .The gallbladder is intact and measures 8.4 x 4.0
x 3.0 cm. The serosal surface appears unremarkable. The cystic duct is patent. Upon
opening, no gallstones are seen .The cystic mucosa appears unremarkable. Representative
sections are submitted in one cassette.
B.The specimen is received fresh and is subsequently placed into formalin. The
container is designated as ""common bile duct lymph node"". The specimen consists of one
lymph node, 1.7 cm. The lymph node is bisected and submitted in cassettes B1 and B2.
C. The specimen is received fresh and is subsequently placed into formalin. The
container is designated ""C. Level 8 lymph node"". The specimen consists of a lymph node,
2.8 cm in largest dimension. The lymph node is bisected and submitted in C1 and C2.
D.The specimen is received fresh and is subsequently placed into formalin. The
container is designated as ""Whipple's specimen"". The specimen consists of a segment of
duodenum and portion of distal stomach, 26.0 cm in length and 8.5 cm in circumference.
The distal duodenum, up to 8.0 cm long, appears hemorrhagic. Attached with the duodenum
is a portion of pancreas, 6.5 x 5.0 x 2.0 cm, with unremarkable outer surface and
resection margin. No tumor nodule is seen in the peripancreatic fat. The distal portion
of the common bile duct is identified, 4.2 cm in length and 1.8 cm in circumference. A
metal stent is seen within the common bile duct. The common bile duct appears
hemorrhagic and rough. The ampullary region mucosa appears slightly elevated. At 2.5 cm
away from the ampulla, there is an area of mucosal depression seemingly adherent with the
underlying lesion. At 1.0 cm away from the depressed mucosa, is a duodenal diverticula.
Otherwise, the duodenal mucosa appears unremarkable. At 2.0 cm proximal to the ampullary
opening, there is suspicious opening of pancreatic duct which is contiguous with the
common bile duct. Serial cross-sections through the pancreas reveal an ill-defined mass Page 3 of 3
lesion, 2.7 cm in maximum dimension. The pancreatic lesion appears to be 0.1 cm away
from the distal resection and 0.1 cm from the uncinate margin. The distal pancreatic
margin is inked blue and the uncinate margin is inked orange. The pancreatic lesion
appears to invade around the common bile duct and focally invades into the submucosa of
the duodenum.

D. The specimen is received fresh and is subsequently placed into formalin. The
container is designated ""D: Body and tail of pancreas at ',and contains a 12.0 x 6.0
x 3.5 cm portion of pancreatic body and tail. The pancreatic body margin is inked blue,
the distal margin is inked orange, and the radial margin is inked black. The specimen is
bisected longitudinally and is fixed in formalin overnight. Sectioning reveals an ill-
defined ,firm,yellow-tan, 4.5 x 3.5 x 3.5 cm mass with a few punctate hemorrhagic areas.
The mass is located in the anterior half of the specimen and grossly extends to the
anterior serosa, to within 1.0 cm of the blue -inked pancreatic body resection margin, and
very close (1-2 mm) to the posterior/retroperitoneal margin. The rim of pancreatic
.tissue proximal to the mass is soft and tan-colored with a normal lobular configuration.
The pancreatic tail tissue distal to the mass (3.5 x 1.0 cm) is attenuated, faintly
nodular, and atrophic-appearing. The pancreatic duct passes through the central

Gross Description
Received are specimen containers A to E .r"" - isitions and specimen containers are
labelled with the patient's name, The cassettes and identifiers are
labelled with the Surgical Number
A:The specimen is received fresh and is subsequently placed into formalin. The
container is designated ""lymph node no 8"" and contains a 2.5 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm firm tan
yellow ovoid portion of tissue grossly consistent with a lymph node. On sectioning, the
lymph node is firm, white, and grossly suspicious. The trisected lymph node is submitted
entirely in Al and A2.
B:The specimen is received fresh and is subsequently placed into formalin. The
container is designated ""portal lymph nodes"" and contains an irregular heavily
cauterized, 0.9 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm greyish tan tissue fragment. The fragment is bisected and
submitted in toto in E1.
C:The specimen is received fresh and is subsequently placed into formalin. The
container is designated ""gallbladder"" and contains an intact unopened 6.5 x 3.5 x 2.0 cm
gallbladder. The gallbladder serosa is smooth and shiny without nodules or adhesions,
and the adventitial surface is slightly roughened. The cystic duct is open. The cystic
duct margin is inked black. A 0.8 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm plump ovoid cystic duct lymph node is
present. The gallbladder lumen contains viscous green bile and no gallstones. The
gallbladder wall is thin, pliable, and approximately 2 mm thick. The gallbladder mucosa
is green and velvety with marked yellow speckling suggestive of cholesterolosis. There
are no polyps ,masses or other lesions .Representative sections are submitted as
follows:
Ci. bisected cystic duct lymph node and black - inked cystic duct margin
C2. two representative sections of gallbladder mucosa, one from near gallbladder
neck and
one from fundus
D:The specimen is received fresh and is subsequently placed into formalin. The
container is designated ""Whipple' s specimen ""and contains a 23 cm long portion of
duodenum with attached 6.5 x 5.5 x 3.5 cm portion of the pancreatic head. The duodenum Page 3 of 3
has an average linear circumference of 4 cm, and the distal 13 cm of the duodenum shows
dusky ischemic discoloration. The duodenal mucosa has the normal pattern of folds,
without polyps or other lesions. The retroperitoneal margin ( designated with a blue
suture) is inked blue and the SMA groove is inked green, and the pancreatic neck margin
is inked black. A portion of the pancreatic duct is identified at the pancreatic neck
margin, but the duct appears occluded lessthan 1 cm from the margin. Replacing much of
the head of the pancreas ,there is an ill-defined roughly 3.7 x 3.5 x 3.5 cm firm rubbery
tan white masswith infiltrative borders. On sectioning, the central portion of the mass
contains numerous cystic spaces filled with thin clear mucin. Grossly, the mass abuts
the retroperitoneal margin and the SMA groove but doesnot clearly involve those margins.
The mass closely abuts the common bile duct, which contains a metal stent. The mass also
approaches to the level of the ampulla, but does not invade the wall of the duodenum.
Numerous lymph nodes are identified in the surrounding peripancreatic fat, a few of which
are slightly enlarged and firm. Representative sections are submitted as follows:
D1. proximal duodenal margin
D2. distal duodenal margin
D3. bile duct margin
D4. tumor with pancreatic neck margin
D5-7. three contiguous sections of tumor showing relationship of tumor with common
bile duct
and retroperitoneal margin
D8. one lymph node bisected (represents the remainder of the lymph node
previously
sampled in B5), one additional possible lymph node inked blue and submitted
whole
D9. tumor with pancreatic margin
D10. tumor with common bile duct and SMA groove
D11. one peripancreatic lymph node trisected
D12. section of tumor with bile duct
D13. peripancreatic fat with possible lymph nodes
D14. two lymph nodes (one node inked blue and bisected)
D15. one node bisected
D16. two lymph nodes(one node inked blue and trisected)
D17. additional section of tumor with bile duct and ampulla
D18-19. central portion of tumor with cystically dilated spaces filled with mucin
D20. one lymph node trisected
D21. two lymph nodes (one node bisected, one node inked blue submitted whole)
D22-25. additional peripancreatic fat with possible lymph nodes
E:The specimen consists of pink tan tissue measuring 2.2 x 1 x 0.3 cm. Submitted in
toto in 91.
The specimen is received fresh for intraoperative consultation in a container designated
""pancreas neck"". The previously frozen tissue is entirely resubmitted for permanent
sections in EQS1.
Frozen Section Diagnosis
E:Pancreatic Neck:
Chronic inflammation with some dilated ducts. No malignancy in the sampled
sections.
Reported by:
Pathologist Comment
E.Permanent sections of the pancreatic neck margin (i.e. slide E1-2) reveal rare
crushed atypical cells, present in pools of mucin surrounding a nerve, highly suspicious
for adenocarcinoma. These cells are not definitively identified in the original frozen
section slides. Since the frozen section represents the ""true"" margin, and the permanent
sections are cut from deeper (more distal) tissue, it is estimated that the true
pancreatic neck margin is negative but that tumor extends very close(likely 1-2 mm) to
this margin.

Received are specimen containers P *n E. All requisitions and specimen containers are
labelled with the patient' s name, The cassettes and identifiers are
labelled with the Surgica.
A. Specimen is received flesu, supsequentiy..placed into formalin. The container is
designated ""A. Gallbladder"". The specimen consists of a purple-tan gallbladder measuring
8.5 x 4.5 x 3.0 cm. Serosal surface is smooth and slightly congested. Cystic duct is
patent. The lumen contains green watery bile. Calculi are not identified. Cystic duct
lymph node is not identified. The mucosa is green and slightly granular. The wall
averages 0.2 cm in thickness. Representative sections are submitted in one cassette.
B. Specimen is received fresh, subsequently placed into formalin. The container is
designated ""B. Lymph node #8"". The specimen consists of an irregular portion of
fibrofatty tissue measuring 2.8 x 1.3 x 0.8 cm. A possible lymph node is identified
measuring 2.0 x 1.0 x 0.8 cm. The possible lymph node is bisected, submitted in toto in
one cassette.
C. Specimen is received fresh, subsequently placed into formalin. The container is
designated ""C. Whipple's"". The specimen consists of a portion of duodenum and attached
pancreas. The duodenum measures 22.0 cm in length and averages 7.0 cm in circumference.
There is little to no attached mesentery and the serosal surface is grey-tan. The
proximal 10.0 cm of the duodenal mucosa is tan and grossly unremarkable. There is a
sharp demarcation from unremarkable to congested mucosa for the remaining length, 14.0
cm.The pancreas measures 6.0 x 5.0 x 2.5 cm. The margins are painted as follows: body
is inked blue, vessel bed orange, and uncinate margin green. The pancreas is serially
sectioned. Cut surface reveals a mucinous ill-defined tan lesion measuring 3.2 x 3.0 x
3.0 cm, and comes within 1.3 cm to the body margin and grossly comes within less than 0.1
cm to the vessel bed and uncinate margins. The lesion abuts the common bile duct.
Remaining pancreatic parenchyma appears grossly unremarkable. The common bile duct is
present and measures 5.0 cm in length and becomes narrowed at the ampulla with thickening
of the wall. Circumference ranges from 0.5 cm at the ampulla and 2.0 cm at the common
bile duct margin. Mucosa appears grossly unremarkable. Three possible lymph nodes
ranging in size from 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.3 cm to 1.5 x 0.8 x 0.8 cm are palpated from the
peripancreatic soft tissue. Sections are submitted as follows:
Cl -shave section, common bile duct margin.
C2 -proximal margin, bisected.
C3-4 -representative sections from distal margin.
C5 -representative section from grossly normal appearing duodenum to congested
mucosa.

Microscopic Description
E. There is a subserosal nodule that is predominantly fibrotic with stromal
calcifications .CD117'is negative and so is 5100 .CD34 highlights blood vessels.
C.Best Tumor Block : C8 (but still requires macrodissection since the tumor has a
hypocellular nature and there is a lymph node in the same section );Best normal tissue

Pathologist Comment
C. Tumor involves the wall of the common bile duct close to the ampulla but does not
involve the ampulla proper .The uncinate and vascular bed margins show cauterized
mucinous cystic nodules that are acellular but represent tumor .Margin status was
discussed with Dr. who reviewed slide C9 and C12.

B.The specimen is received fresh and designatedas ""B - gallbladder at The
specimen consists of dusky grey, intact gallbladder ( 8.1 x 3 .5 x 1.0 cm). The serosal
surface is smooth and glistening. No identifiable nodules or abnormalities present. Nocystic lymph nodesidentified. On opening the gallbladder surface is light green and
velvety with no identifiable calculi. Thereis a scant amount of thin green bile.
Average wall thickness is 0.3 cm .Representative sections of the body, fundus, and
cystic duct margin are submitted in cassette BI.
C.The specimen, is received fresh and designated as ""C - whipple' s specimen at
The specimen consists of a whipple's procedure including proximal and distal duodenum,
pancreatic head, and pancreatic uncinate process .No pyloric sphincter or gastric mucosa
identified. Duodenum measures 21.2 cm in length and 6.5 cm in circumference. The distal
14.0 cm of duodenum is dusky and dark brown in color with sharp demarcation consistent
with ischemia. The proximal portion is light tan-brown with regular plicae circulares
extending from proximal to distal end. The bile duct extending to the ampulla of Vater
is bisected and opened prior to fixation. The area surrounding ampulla of Vater is
distinct from the surrounding duodenal mucosa.It is firm multinodular, dark-brown with
irregular border extending roughly 3.1 x 2.2 cm with somecontraction distorting the
surrounding mucosal surface .Broad based nodules measure in size range from 0.2 to 0.5 cm
in greatest diameter. The full length of common bile duct to the ampulla of Vater is 4.8
cm with an average diameter of 0.3 cm. Please note, the margins are inked as follows:
Blue pancreatic resection margin, orange uncinate process ,black vessel bed margin. The
pancreatic resection margin measures 2.3 x 1.8 cm with central pancreatic duct (0.2 cm in
diameter). The pancreatic duct can be probed only distally to a length of 1.8cm. Proximal
portion was not identified. Combined the pancreas measures 5.6 x 4 .8 x 2.7 cm. The cut
surface of the common bile duct shows heterogenous light yellow, firm, irregular lesion
extending 3.0 cm from the ampulla of Vater into the common bile duct involving the
ampulla and duodenal submucosa .On cross sectioning, the tumor is solid, light-yellow,
firm, with no obvious areas of necrosis or hemorrhage. The tumor seems to occupy the
majority of uncinate process ,head of the pancreas and grossly extends within 0.6 cm of
the pancreatic resection margin and fully involves the common bile duct closest to the
ampulla of Vater. The tumor itself, is poorly demarcated with a diffuse infiltrating
border into the normal pancreatic parenchyma. Grossly, the tumor measures 4.8 x 3.6 x
2.2 cm. The specimen was photographed. The representative sections are submitted as

Pathologist Comment
Invasive moderately differentiated ductal carcinoma of the pancreas arising in the
background of PanIN3. Large cells with pleomorphic nuclei forming incomplete glands with
mucinous features (<50%). Atypical mitoses present and extensive desmoplastic response.
Adenocarcinoma involves duodenal muscularis mucosae ,ampulla of Vater, and common bile
duct with focal epithelial cancerization. Cancer invades within 0.6 cm of the pancreatic
resection margin, 0.15 cm of the posterior resection margin, and is present at the
vascular bed resection margin. Distal common bile duct is denuded of epithelium likely
due to instrumentation ( stent placement).

The sections demonstrate a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma involving the head of
pancreas and ampullary region extending into the duodenal wall without duodenal mucosal
involvement. Based on the overall morphologic findings, the carcinoma is best classified
as arising from the pancreaticobiliary tract rather than from the ampulla, This
distinction, however, can be somewhat problematic in tumors involving both regions.
This tumor does demonstrate extraprostatic extension as well as vascular and perineural

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A.Received fresh for frozen section labeled with the patient's name and ""pancreatic
margin"" is a 2 x 2 x 0.5 cm portion of pancreas. A stitch marks the true margin. The
specimen is submitted in block A for frozen section of the margin.
B.Received fresh for frozen section labeled with the patient's name and ""common bile
duct margin"" is the common bile duct margin consisting of two dilated ducts. one measuring
1.5 cm and an adjacent smaller duct measuring 0.8 cm. A suture marks the true margin,
Blue ink is applied to the true margin. The specimen is submitted en face in block B for
frozen section.
C.Received fresh in the operating room labeled with the patient's name and ""whipple
contents"" with request for tissue banking is a whipple resection. The following
measurements are obtained: length across from the lesser curvature 10 cm, length along
greater curvature 9 cm, proximal gastric margins 7 cm, duodenum 13 cm in length and 3 cm in
diameter, common bile duct 1 cm in length, 1.5 cm in diameter at margin, and pancreatic
head approximately 5.5 x 5 x 4 cm. There is a posterior-inferior staple line which
measures 4.5 cm in length. Adjacent to this is a stitch which marks the
uncinate/retroperitoneal margin. Yellow ink is applied to this margin. The pancreatic

margin measures 2 x 1.5 cm. Blue ink is applied to this margin. There is a stent
within the common bile duct. Black ink is applied to the common bile duct margin. Black
ink is also applied along the stapled gastric margin and blue ink is applied along the
stapled duodenal margin. The adipose tissue adjacent to the lesser and greater curvature
are separated for lymph node dissection. The specimen is opened lengthwise along the
lesser curvature and along the border of the duodenum. The mucosa surrounding the ampulla
of Vater is heaped up and hyperemic for three-fourths of the circumference. I am hesitant
to completely open the specimen in the fresh state as that this may represent an ampullary
or periampullar area tumor which would require better fixation. In an attempt to see if
there is a pancreatic head mass .Iplaced an incision along the posterior aspect of
the pancreas going into the head of the pancreas revealing a possible tumor within the
pancreatic head where the pancreatic tissue has a more gray-white appearance and fibrotic
texture. Within the plane of section, this area measures approximately 1.5 cm. A small
portion of this area is provided to the tissue bank coordinator. The specimen is then
pinned out on corkboard and placed into formalin for overnite fixation prior to further
sectioning and evaluation. Blue ink is further applied to the staple line adjacent to the
uncinate process.
The fixed specimen is evaluated, A longitudinal cut is made from the ampulla of Vater
through to the common bile duct margin. In this plane, a tumor is identified in the
periampullary region from the ampulla of Vater extending for 2.3 cm. The tumor tapers at
the junction of the common bile duct and pancreatic duct. This area is contiguous with the
area in the pancreatic head identified at the time of initial evaluation for tissue
banking and the mass is judged to measure approximately 3 cm. Several peripancreatic
lymph nodes are identified which range from 0.8 to 1.5 cm. Several lymph nodes are
identified along the lesser curvature ranging up to 1 cm.

CARCINOMA OF PANCREAS
Gross Description
Received in formalin labeled with the patient 's name and
""pancreatic ducdenectomy ""is a previously dissected specimen so
designated with the included loop of duodenum measuring 17 cm
along the greater curve .The proximal margin reveals a staple
closure and appears pylorus -sparing and demonstrates a
circumference of 4.5 cm. The proximal staple line is removed
and the freshly exposed surface is lightly inked blue. The
distal duodenum reveals a staple closure as well and a
circumference of 5 cam with the circumference measuring 4.5 cm at
-tielevel of the ampulla .The common duct has been previously
opened and measures 5.5 cm in length with a proximal
circumference of 2 cm diminishing to 0.8 cm at the ampulla. The
mucosa of the common duct is relatively smooth and yellow/tan.
The duodenum in the area of the ampulla reveals a discrete area
of induration and effacement over an area measuring 2 x 1.5 cm
which corresponds to a relatively well-demarcated ,firm and Page 3 of 4
yellow/tan mass occupying the head of the pancreas with the mass
measuring 3 x 3 x 3 cm in greatest dimensions. The pancreatic
resection margin measures 3.3 x 1.5 cm and has been previously
inked black.The pancreas itself measures overall 6 cm superior
to inferior x 3.5 cm right to left x 4.5 cm anterior to
posterior.Soft tissue inferior to the pancreas has been
previously inked black in a ragged area where there is a suture
designated as identifying a portion of superior mesenteric
vein.This area of tissue is indurated and continuous with the
previously described inferior pancreatic tumor.The tumor is
separated from the pancreatic resection margin by a minimum of 2
cm grossly normal pancreas. The section code is as follows:
Al=shave of pancreatic resection margin; A2=shave of distal
duoderial margin; A3=proximal duodenum parallel to the lumen,
posterior, with proximal aspect inked blue after removing staple
closure; A4=shave of proximal common duct resection margin;
A5-AlO=sutured area indicating superior mesenteric vein remnant,
blocked out, serially sectioned perpendicular to surface and
totally submitted (note that vein is not recognized grossly);
Ail-A13=apparently ulcerated duodenum overlying pancreatic
tumor; A14=duplicate cross-sections of proximal common duct not
to include resection margin; A15, A16=ampulla of Vater adjacent
to overlying tumor parallel to lumen of common duct; A17,
A18=additional sections of tumor not to include resection
margin; A19-A20 and A21-A22=two dominant lymph nodes serially
sectioned and totally submitted, two cassettes each; A23,
A24=two additional lymph nodes, serially sectioned and totally
submitted, separate cassettes; and A25-A28=additional potential

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
1Received fresh, labeled with the patient's name and ""Whipple"" is a specimen consisting
of duodenum(24 cm in length by 8 cm in open circumference by 0.6 cm wall thickness) and
pancreatic head (3cm from the anterior to posterior, 6 cm in length and 3 cm from superior
to inferior). There is a poorly defined white-tan mucinous tumor mass (3.5 x 1.7 x 3.0
cm) in the head of the pancreas which obstructs the main pancreatic duct. The bile duct
is patent and measures 0.6 cm in diameter. The tumor is grossly 1.2 cm from the ampulla

of Vater and does not grossly involve the duodenal muscularis mucosa. The tumor is 3.5 cm
from the distal resection margin, which is grossly free of tumor. The anterior and
posterior margins are composed of yellow adipose tissue measuring up to 0.5 cm in
thickness and are grossly free of tumor. The remainder of the pancreatic parenchyma is
firm, tan, and nodular. The cystic duct remnant measures 0.5 cm in length and 0.7 cm in
diameter. The duodenal mucosa is unremarkable. Six probable lymph nodes are found in the
posterior/inferior soft tissue ranging in size from 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm to 1.0 x 0.7 x 0.5
cm. Eight probable lymph nodes are found in the anterior/superior soft tissue, ranging in
size from 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm to 1.0 x 0.7 x 0.7 cm. Three retroperitoneal probable lymph
nodes are found, ranging in size from 0.7 x 0.8 x 0.5

Comment
There is a cystic component to the tumor (approximately 20% grossly) which is not clearly an intraductal papillary mucinous
neoplasm (IPMN). The differential diagnosis includes colonization of a retention cyst or large duct by carcinoma versus IPMN
replaced by carcinoma.
Some of the positive lymph nodes appear to be positive by direct extension of the tumor.
The micropapillary component accounts for approximately 10% of the tumor.
Selected slides from this ease have been reviewed at our daily

aaar e_nato 1)Ynr, Yn9cm. The specimen is submitted entirely, wrapped in lens paper in cassette ""D1."" Dictated by
Specimen E is received fresh and is labeled ""Whipple."" It consists of a pancreaticoduodenectomy specimen with duodenum
measuring 19.5 cm in length and 5.5 cm in circumference and pancreatic head measuring 4.5 cm anterior/posterior, 5.4 cm
superior-to-inferior and 5.0 cm from duodenal edge to neck edge. The stomach and gallbladder are not present. The common
bile duct is dilated and measures 2.9 cm in length and 0.6 cm in diameter. The pancreatic duct measures 3.0 cm in length and up
to 0.2 cm in diameter. The two ducts open to different ampullae through separate orifices. The accessory ampulla measures 0.5
x 0.4 cm, does not communicate with the common bile duct nor the cystic duct, and is 1.0 cm from the proximal duodenal margin.
There is a mass located predominantly in the pancreatic head that has both solid (80%) and cystic components (20%). The mass
is tan-white with well-defined borders and measures 2.3 x 2.2 x 2.0 cm. Areas of necrosis are not identified. There are no
polypoid or soft friable papillary areas. The mass does not involve the ampulla. The mass abuts the common bile duct and
invasion cannot be grossly ruled out. The mass grossly involves the pancreatic duct causing constriction at 1.0 cm from the
ductal edge. The mass does not involve the duodenum and is grossly confined to the pancreatic head. The mass is located 1.0
cm from the pancreatic neck edge and abuts and possibly involves the retroperitoneal edge and vascular bed. The mass abuts
the free posterior lateral surface and is 0.8 cm from the free anterior surface. The accessory ampulla is uninvolved by the mass.
A representative section of the mass as well as uninvolved duodenum is submitted to The
specimen is inked as follows: vascular bed-blue, retroperitoneal edge-black, accessory ampulla-green, serosal surface-blue.

ADDENDUM MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
Deeper levels and additional histologic sections are reviewed. As stated in the original
report, this pancreas is involved by ductal adenocarcinoma. The neoplasm shows
discontiuous spread and appears to arise from a background of high grade pancreatic
ductal dysplasia, with tumor surrounding dilated ductal elements (4H and 41). There is
periampullary involvement (4F). The lack of continuity between foci makes evaluation
of tumor size difficult, but it appears greater than 2 cm overall. Perineural tumor is
present. There are multiple peripheral foci consistent with atrophic change, some
associated with inflammation. The designated surgical margins (1-3) are negative for
diagnostic dysplasia or malignancy. The permanent sections of the bile duct (4G),
taken from the Whipple specimen, show foci of glandular dysplasia in a background of
inflammation (particularly in the deeper levels). There is no involvement by carcinoma,
however. The true margin was submitted at the time of surgery (specimen #1) and is
negative. All examined lymph nodes are negative for diagnostic metastatic disease.
ADDENDUM DIAGNOSIS:
1.Bile duct margin ,biopsy:
-Negative for diagnostic high grade dysplasia or malignancy.
2.Pancreatic neck margin ,biopsy:
-Negative for diagnostic high grade dysplasia or malignancy.
3.Pancreatic uncinate margin ,biopsy:
-Negative for diagnostic high grade dysplasia or malignancy ;atrophy.
4.Pancreas ,distal stomach and proximal small bowel ,Whipple resection:
-Ductal adenocarcinoma of pancreas ,moderately differentiated.
-Resection margins negative (see above discussion).
-Seventeen (17) peripancreatic lymph nodes ,NEGATIVE for metastatic
carcinoma.
5.Stent (gross only):
-Plastic tubing ,consistent with stent.
6.Lymph nodes ,celiac ,regional resection:
-Two (2 )lymph nodes, NEGATIVE for metastatic carcinoma.
7.Lymph node, portal ,biopsy:

Comment
The tumor invades into the duodenal wall, the serosal side of the adhesed
gastric wall. A cystic lesion (slide E 15) exhibits features of a branch duct-
intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm. Therefore, the invasive carcinoma is
interpreted as arising from the IPMN.

Reported by
MICROS.. OPICSections of the tumour confirm a well to moderately differentiated ductal carcinoma arising in the
posterior body/neck adjacent to the mid to distal common bile duct (CBD). The overall tumour
dimensions are 20 x 20 x 20mm. The tumour spreads alongside the mid common bile duct (with a
common bile duct margin of 10mm). Tumour shows a gland and ductal architecture with marked
desmoplasia and extensive perineural infiltration. There is extensive perineural invasion and spread
into the peripancreatic tissue. Tumour invades the wall of the portal vein (Block 3) but does not reach
the lumen or involve the peripheral venous resection margin. The tumour comes to within lmm of the
posterior soft tissue margin at the neck of pancreas (blocks 4 and 7) Lymphovascular space invasion is
noted (Blocks 4) with extension into a peripancreatic node(Block 8) with a micrometastis in a
peripancreatic node (Block 4) and periuncinate node (block 15). Adjacent to the tumour high grade
Pan1N is identified (block 8).
REVIEWING DOCTOR 'S SIGNATURE:DATE:
Page 2 of 4 Sections from the pancreatic neck resection margin show chronic pancreatitis. No high grade PanIN is
identified. Sections from the proximal common bile duct margin show no evidence of malignancy and
uninvolved cystic duct node.
Representative sections from the ampulla of Vater show reactive changes within the common bile duct
epithelium along with some epithelial hyperplasia. Representative sections from the pancreas
elsewhere show normal morphology of ducts without PanIN. Fatty infiltration of the pancreas is seen in
Blocks 11 & 12 with associated fat necrosis. Representative sections from the gallbladder show
Rokitansky-Aschoff sinus formation with fibrosis of the gallbladder wall and a mixed inflammatory
cell infiltrate. The gallbladder mucosa is attenuated and shows underlying haemorrhage.
Cholesterolosis is not identified. Representative sections from the proximal gastric margin are within
normal limits. Representative sections from the pylorus are within normal limits. Representative
sections from the distal small bowel margin are also within normal limits.
Three out of eight peripancreatic nodes contain tumour (including the one seen in Block 4 and
including the one seen in Block 8 and block 15). No lesser curve nodes are identified. Only one single
lymphoid aggregate is noted from the greater curve. There are two cystic duct nodes .This gives a total
of three out of eleven nodes involved.

Gross Description
A. PANCREAS
Received fresh labeled with the patient name
Description: Unoriented 46 g, 9.2 x 3.5 x 2.8 cm segment of pancreas with the tenuously attached 12 x
10 x 1.5 cm portion of omental apron. Duodenum and bile ducts are not present. Prior to sectioning the
stapled margin of the pancreas is stained with green dye. As the pancreas is received without
orientation, all remaining surfaces are stained black. A poorly defined 3.2 x 2.4 x 1.7 cm tumor is found
approximately 2 cm from the stapled margin. The tumor is grossly free of all margins. Much of the
pancreas demonstrates dilated pancreatic ducts, fat necrosis and fibrosis. There is no gross appearance
of tumor involving the omentum. The specimen is dissected for lymph nodes.

CLINICAL HISTORY: Per prior biopsy adenocarcinoma in the pancreas.
OPERATION: Pylorus preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy
CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS: Pancreatic mass
GROSS DESCRIPTION: Two specimens are received labeled with the
patient's name and medical record number.
The first specimen labeled ""gallbladder"" is received in formalin and
consists of a single piece of tan, soft tissue measuring 8.1 x 3.0 x
2.2 cm representing a gallbladder. Grossly, a 1.8 cm greatest
dimension green gallstone is identified. Representative sections
are submitted in cassette Al.
The second specimen labeled ""Whipple specimen"" is received fresh
from the OR and consists of a piece of small bowel with attached
pancreas measuring 32 x 7 x 5 cm. The uncinate margin is inked in
blue, the vascular growth is inked in black and the pancreatic
resection margin is inked in green. The common bile duct and
pancreatic duct are probed. The specimen is incised on the anterior
aspect and a palpable firm, tan, well circumscribed mass is revealed
measuring 4.1 x 3.5 x 3.1 cm. Sections are submitted as follows: B1
distal duodenal margin, B2 proximal duodenal margin, B3 bile duct
margin, B4-5 pancreatic resection margin, amputated and submitted on
edge, B6-7 uncinate margin, amputated and submitted on edge, B8 full
cross section of tumor from green ink to the duodenum, B9
cross-section of tumor to black ink, B10 tumor surrounding common
bile duct to black ink, Bll representative section of tumor, B12
normal appearing pancreas, B13-21 peripancreatic fat for lymph
nodes.
COMMENT: Histological sections show pancreatic adenocarcinoma
centered around the pancreatic duct. Sections of the residual
pancreatic parenchyma show fat necrosis and chronic pancreatitis.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. EPIGASTRIC HERNIA Received in formalin is an irregularly shaped piece of fibroadipose soft tissue measuring 4.2 x 2.7 x 2.4
cm. Serial sectioning reveals no mass or nodularity. Representative sections are submitted in one
cassette labeled A.
B. DISTAL PANCREAS AND SPLEEN
Received fresh and subsequently fixed in formalin in a single matching container is a distal
pancreatectomy/splenectomy specimen weighing 168 grams overall. The spleen measures 11.0 x 6.5 x
4.0 cm and the pancreatic portion measures 11.0 x 5.5. x 3.8 cm. There is a stapled margin at the
proximal aspect of the pancreas measuring 3.5 cm in length. The entire anterior aspect of the pancreas
and spleen are inked blue. The posterior aspect of both pancreas and spleen is inked black. On serial
sectioning is a firm, tan-white mass present within the pancreatic parenchyma that measures 4.2 x 3.1 x
2.4 cm. Tissue is procured from the mass. Grossly the mass extends to within 0.1 cm of the anterior
retroperitoneal margin. Grossly the pancreatic duct cannot definitively be identified. The mass also
extends to within 0.1 cm of the posterior retroperitoneal margin. The splenic surface has a coarsely
granular texture. Serial sectioning reveals no focal lesions. The pancreatic mass is located 1.2 cm
from the splenic hilum. The spleen is uninvolved by the mass. Representative sections are submitted
as follows:
131:proximal pancreatic margin (stapled margin)
132-B5: mass with anterior and posterior retroperitoneal margins
B6-B7: mass with margins and adjacent grossly uninvolved pancreas
B8-B9: spleen
