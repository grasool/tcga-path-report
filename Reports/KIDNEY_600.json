Extending from the renal pelvis is a ureter (8 x 0.5 cm) renal artery measuring 7x\n0.5 cm, and rend vein measuring 0.5 x 1 cm. The renal vein is free of gross abnormality at the margin. The specimen\nis received with a surface disruption at the inferior pole and at the lateral aspect of the kidney measuring 6 cm in\ngreatest dimension through which friable necrotic debris extrudes. The adjacent fat is marked with black ink. In the\nmid lower pole and corresponding to the capsular disruption is a well circumscribed predominantly necrotic mass\nmeasuring 15 x 10 x 9 cm. The mass lies 1 cm from the renal vein margin and grossly extends through the renal Page 2 of 2\ncapsule and perirenal fat at the capsular disruption site. The remainder of the renal cortex is tan-brown with a well\ndefined corticomedullaryjunction. The pelvis and calyces are covered by smooth glistenin mucosa .The adipose\ntissue is thinly sectioned, and no lymph nodes are found .The case is reviewed by , Representative sections\nof the specimen are submitted as follows :Al) renal vein, artery and ureter margins en face ;A2-3) capsular\ndisruption two fragments per cassette ;A4-8) capsule wall, two fragments per cassette ;A9) non- neoplastic kidney;\nAl 0) perinephritic fat.\nAt the request oM the specimen is regrossed with additional sections of the perlhilar blood vessels\nsubmitted in cassettes Al 1-A15 under the direction ot^ ^s\nMICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:\nSections of vascular and ureteral margin tissues do not show a neoplasm .Sections of the grossly described\nlesion show a necrotic papillary carcinoma with patchy hemosiderin, and areas of variably foamy cytoplasm.

Right kidney mass: In formalin labeled \"right kidney mass\" is a 15 x 7.5 x 6.5 cm kidney with abundant attached\nperinephric fat weight 1,721 grams in aggregate. There is 3.5 cm ureter extending from the renal hilum. The kidney is\nbivalved to reveal an ill defined 8.5 cm in greatest dimension variegated tan-white to red nodular tumor within the\nsuperior pole. On cut section, the tumor grossly appears to possibly extend into the perinephric fat at the superior pole.\nThe lining of the renal pelvis is grey-white and slightly bosselated. Upon sectioning it appears that the tumor elevates\nthe urothelium and It is unclear at gross dissection whether the tumor penetrates through the urothelium into the renal\npelvis. The tumor also grossly extends into the renal artery, lying 5mm from the renal artery resection margin. The\nremaining renal parenchyma is pale tan-pink with an ill defined corticomedullary junction. There is a small portion of\nadrenal gland at the most superior aspect of the specimen with an orange red out surface. The gland grossly does not\nappear to be involved by tumor. The perinephric fat is inked black. Representative sections are submitted in eight\ncassettes as labeled: A vascular and ureter margins, B tumor to include perinephric fat, C-D tumor to include renal\npelvis, E tumor to include renal artery, F tumor to include uninvolved renal parenchyma, G normal renal parenchyma, H\nadrenal gland.\n2. Peri-caval node. In formalin labeled \"peri-caval node\" are two nodular tan-pink tissues which measure 3.5 x 3 x 2.3 cm\n3.and 2.5 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm. The larger tissue Is inked blue and the smaller tissue is inked black. Sectioning of the larger\ntissue reveals a slightly friable and partially cystic tan-pink cut surface containing coagulated blood. Sectioning of the\nsmaller tissue reveals a partially cystic red-brown cut surface containing coagulated blood. Representative sections are\nsubmited in 4 cassettes as follows: A-B entire smaller tissue ,C-D larger tissue.\nGallbladder :In formalin labeled \"gallbladder\" is a 9.5 x 5 x 2.8 cm intact gallbladder. The serosa is tan-pink and dull.\nThe cystic duct is 0.3 cm in diameter and patent .The gallbladder wall averages 0.2 cm in thickness. The mucosa is\nvelvety yellow-red with diffuse yellow stippling within the body. The lumen contains tan-yellow viscous bile and a 2.5 cm\ngreen -black granu,tar cholelith.

Trimmed of fat the kidney is 133 gm, 9.3 x 5.8 x 3.8 cm. Arising from the \nrenal pelvis is a 7.8 cm in length and 0.6 em in diameter segment of ureter, a 2.2 cm in length and 1 em in \ndiameter segment of renal artery, and a 1.2 cm in length and 0.8 cm in diameter segment of renal vein. No \nlymph nodes are identified in the renal pelvis and no adrenal gland tissue is identified within the perirenal \nfat. The kidney is purple-brown with a faint lobulated appearance. On the inferior pole there is a 3.5 em in \ndiameter spherical nodule with a yellow-tan coloration. In this area the capsule is inked black. The cut \nsurface identifies a 5.5 x 3.5 x 3.5 cm mottled yellow-tan tumor mass with focal areas of hemorrhagic \nnecrosis and white fibrous areas up to 1.2 cm in maximum diameter. In addition, there are cystic structures \nfrom 0.1 to 1 cm in diameter. Grossly, the tumor mass extends to the renal capsule but does not penetrate \nthe capsule. In addition, the tumor extends into the vein ofthe renal pelvis. The remaining renal \nparenchyma is red-brown. The surface of the cortex exhibits broad-based scars up to 1.6 cm in diameter. \nIn addition, there are renal retention cysts from 0.2 to 0.8 cm. The renal cortex averages 0.5 cm in \nthickness and the medulla averages 1.2 cm. No other masses or indurated areas are grossly identified. \nSummary of sections: 1 -surgical margins of the ureter, renal artery and renal vein, 2-4 -tumor mass and \nrenal capsule, 5-6 -tumor mass and renal pelvis, 7 -representative section of renal parenchyma with scar, \n8 -representative section of renal parenchyma with renal retention cysts, 9-11 tumor within segmental \nbranches of renal vein. \nMicroscopic Description \nMicroscopic examination has been performed on all slides.

It consists of a nephrectomy specimen\nwhich together with perinephric fat weighs 446 grams. It measures 17.5 cm from superior to inferior, 9 cm\nfrom medial to lateral, and 4.5 cm from anterior to posterior. Along the medial-superior edge of the\nperinephric fat there is a intact appearing 6.5 x 3.5 x 1 cm portion of adrenal gland. Along the anterior\nsurface of the kidney there Is a thin delicate membranous tissue consistent with Gerota 's fascia\napproximately measuring 10 x 5 cm. The central-lateral surface of the nephrectomy specimen is torn and\ndisrupted exposing the cortical surface of the kidney which Is bulging .Serial sections of the adrenal gland\nreveal no gross evidence of tumor involvement. At the hilum of the kidney the renal artery and renal vein\nare identified. The vessels are opened and there is no gross evidence of intraluminal tumor. Extending\nfrom the hilum of the kidney is a small caliber portion of ureter which is 6.5 cm in length and 0.3 cm In\ndiameter. The ureter is opened to the renal pelvis to reveal the urothelium Is tan-white and smooth and\nunremarkable. Sectioning through the central-lateral surface of the kidney reveals a well circumscribed\ngolden yellow and thinly capsulated appearing neoplasm which overall measures 3.3 x 3.2 x 2.8 cm. This\nneoplasm abuts the cortical surface of the kidney but grossly does not appear to extend through the renal\ncapsule Into the small amount of adherent perirenal adipose tissue .The neoplasm Is 3.5 cm from the\nhilum and hilar vascuiature. There is some cautery and cavitation of the renal parenchyma just along the\nsuperior edge of the tumor suggestive of surgical manipulation .There is some hemorrhage extending\ninto the hilar fat. The kidney away from the neoplasm has a normal reddish brown appearance and the\ncortical medullary junction appears distinct. The cortical thickness is 0.7 cm. Close sectioning of the\nremainder of the kidney reveals no additional masses. The perinephric adipose tissue is dissected but no\nlymph nodes are identified grossly. Also in the specimen container is an additional 7.5 cm aggregate of\nlobulated fatty tissue which is serially sectioned and palpably unremarkable. Representative sections of\nthe tumor are obtained for research purposes. Following fixation the sections are submitted as\nsummarized below: Section summary: Al) surgical margin, renal artery, renal vein and ureter, A2)\nadrenal gland, A3) additional sections of ureter and ureteral pelvic junction, A4) Gerota's fascia, A5-A7)\nsections of central-lateral tumor and cortical surface of kidney, A7-A8) sections of tumor and immediately\nadjacent renal tissue.

It consists of a \nnephrectomy specimen with adherent long segment of ureter which weighs   The nephrectomy \nspecimen measures 14 cm from superior to inferior, 7.5 cm from medial to lateral, and 5 cm from anterior \nto posterior. There is no grossly identifiable adrenal gland tissue. Along the anterior surface of the kidney \nis a 8 x 5.5 cm area of thin delicate adherent tissue suggestive of Gerota's fascia. At the hilum the renal \nartery and renal vein are identified. The vessels are opened and show no gross evidence of intraluminal \ntumor. Extending from the hilum of the kidney is a 26 cm segment of ureter which proximally and \ncentrally has a diameter of 0.5 cm, up to 0.6 cm at the distal end. A yellow plastic stent is present in the \nlumen of the ureter. The ureter is opened and the urothelium is tan and smooth. At the pelvis friable \ntumor is present in the renal pelvis arising from the central calix. The kidney is bivalved to reveal a finely \ngranular tan-white neoplasm occupying the superior pole calix and extending into the middle pole calix. \nThis neoplasm overall measures 3.7 x 3.2 x 3.2 cm. It is approximately 1 cm from Gerota's fascia and 1.5 \ncm from the renal hilar vascular margin. It involves the upper pole and central pole calices. The inferior \npole calix appears uninvolved. The renal parenchyma is otherwise reddish brown and cortical thickness is \n0.6 cm. There are no obvious lymph nodes in the perinephric adipose tissue. Representative sections are \nsubmitted.

It consists of a nephrectomy specimen\nwhich together perinephric fat weighs 627 grams. It measures 20 cm from superior to inferior, 10 cm from\nmedial to lateral, and 9 cm from anterior to. posterior. Along the anterior surface there is lobulated fatty\ntissue and there is a bulging fluctuant mass at the inferior pole of the kidney. At the hilum the renal artery\nand renal vein are identified. The vessels are opened and show no gross evidence of intraluminal tumor.\nExtending from the hilum of the kidney there is an 8 cm segment of ureter which appears somewhat\nattenuated. The ureter is opened to reveal smooth tan-white urothelium. The kidney is bivalved to reveal\na fluid filled cystic mass in the inferior pole which bulges anteriorly this cystic mass measures 6 x 8 x 52\ncm. It contains amorphous brown material and turbid fluid. The lining of the cyst Is brown with patchy\nsmall areas of yellow discoloration. The cyst is 1.3 cm from the hitum of the kidney. It appears contained\nwithin the renal capsule and is separated from the anterior surface of the kidney by a thin layer of smooth\nfascial tissue. Representative sections of the mass are obtained for research purposes. The remaining\nkidney has pale red parenchyma and normal appearing medullary rays. Cortical thickness is 0.8 cm. There\nare scattered fluid filled cysts within the cortical portion of the kidney which are up to 1.3 cm. No other\ndiscrete masses are present. Serial sections of the perineural adipose tissue reveal no grossly obvious\nlymph nodes and no identifiable adrenal tissue. Representative sections are submitted.\nSection summary:\nAl) surgical margin, renal artery, renal vein and ureter,\nA2) additional sections of ureter and ureteral pelvic junction,\nA3) anterior surface of lower pole kidney including possible Gerota's fascia,\nA4-A6) additional representative sections of cyst,\nA7) cyst and closest approach to hilum,\nAB) uninvolved kidney.\nMicroscopic Description:\nMicroscopic sections have been examined.

The tumor is\ncharacterized by multinodular growth and tumor cells with\nmoderately pleomorphic medium to large oval nuclei with\noccasional nuclear grooves and ample eosinophilic to\nvacuolated cytoplasm. In areas the papillary formations are\ndensely packed'and essentially solid. There is multifocal\nintratumoral hemosiderin and formation of cystic nodules\nfilled with papillary tumor and blood. Tumor abuts the\nfibrous renal capsule, but does not clearly invade perirenal\nfat on multiple levels examined. There is invasion of small\nnon-muscularized veins in the renal sinus but no definitive\ninvasion of the renal sinus fat or large branches of the\nrenal vein.\nThe tumor is associated with a significant and extensive\ndiffuse and nodular lymphocytic infiltrate at the periphery\nof the lesion that also extensively involve perinephric and\nrenal sinus fat, and show sheets and nodules of cells\nextensively involve the remaining non-carcinomatous renal\ncortex. These are monomorphic-appearing small lymphocytes,\nand by immunohistochemistry are diffusely positive for CD20\nand BCL-2. The same B cells are negative for CD5 and CD23,\nwhich highlights residual germinal center dendritic cells.\nCD3 and CD5 show staining in a smaller population of T\nlymphocytes. BCL-6 and cyclin D1 are negative.\nSections of the omental nodule show a spherical accessory\nspleen with relatively normal splenic architecture and small\nperiarterial lymphoid nodules. The adipose tissue\nsurrounding the splenule is involved by dense sheets and\nnodules of the same lymphoid infiltrate with identical immunophenotype to the kidney. Thel eft pelvic lymph node\nshows involvement by both metastatic papillary carcinoma and\nthe same abnormal lymphoid population, with near complete\neffacement of residual normal nodal architecture in the\nTHIS CONFIDENTIAL AND PRIVILEGED DOCUMENT/INFORMATION IS PROTECTED BY\nFEDERAL AND STATE LAW.

This case was discussed with Dr. Per Dr.\nthe specimen submitted as deep margin (8) was taken from the left lateral tumor (specimen C).The left lateral tumor is not transec ted in the histologic\nsections examined .Multiple satellite foci (greater than 10) are noted in the renal parenchyma surrounding the three main lesions in specimen C-E. Some\nof these satellite lesions measure less than 1 mm. Therefore it is possible that the deep margin tumor in specimen B represents a separate focus of\ntumorrather than a positive margin from the left lateral tumor since the left lateral tumor was not transacted.A conversation with Dr also\nreveals that the upper pole tumor ( 0) was adherent to the specimen submitted as left cyst wall (A). The upper pole tumor showed a \u25ba+ a\u25baea of capsular\nretraction with ink focally extending to the tumor .This additional information from Dr. lakes it likely that this area of concern was the site of the\nadherent cyst and therefore does not represent a true margin.\nin summary, no tumor transection is noted ,however ,this patient is at increased risk for recurrence due to the numerous small satellite lesions noted.\nAddendum Reoort Issued Bv:\nMAD\nDIAGNOSIS:\nA.

SEE COMMENT. \nComment: \nThe aspirates are pauci-cellular and reveal rare small clusters of malignant epithelial cells in a background of blood. Only rare \nreactive bronchial cells and sparse inflammatory cells are present. The tumor cells are large with abundant granular cytoplasm and \nwell defined cell borders. The nuclei are enlarged and mildly pleomorphic with moderately Irregular contours, coarse chromatin \nand prominent central nucleoli. The morphologic findings are consistent with a renal cell carcinoma. To confirm the diagnosis and \nhelp exclude a primary lung tumor, we performed a panel of immunohistochemical stains on the cell block material with the \nfollowing resulls: \nAntibody \nCD10 \nPan-keratin \nCK7 \nCK20 \nRCC \nCD68 \nTTF-1 Usual reactivity \nRenal cell marker, \nEpithelial marker \nEpithelial marker \nEpithelial marker \nRenal cell marker \nHistiocyte marker \nPulmonary cell marker Result \nPositive \nPositive \nPositive \nNegative \nNegative \nNegative \nNegative \nThe immunohistochemical staining pattern supports the morphologic diagnosis. Positive staining for CD1 0 and pan keratin with \nnegative staining for CK 20 is consistent with renal cell carcinoma. Although CK7 is often negative in most renal cell carcinomas, \npositive staining can be seen in up to 1/3 of cases. Similarly, negative staining for ReC is seen in approximately 13% of cases. \nNegative staining for CD68 indicated the tumor cells are not reactive pulmonary macrophages which can have similar morphology \nin rare cases. Negative staining for TTF-1 also rules against a diagnosis of a primary lung carcinoma. Overall, based on \n. the final diagnosis is that of metastatic renal cell carcinoma. \nreviewed this case and concur with the diagnosis. \nLESS THAN OPTIMAL -SCANT CELLULARITY. \nNEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS. \nHYPERCELLUALR SPECIMEN WITH REACTIVE EPITHELIAL CELLS AND BLOOD (see comment). \nComment: ..

It is not certain whether or \nnot the tumor has invaded through Garota's fascia Into surrounding 60ft tissue, or whether this represen ts ~ \nsurgical defect in Gerow's fascia; therefore , the assigned pT stage is pT3a+. The case was discussed with \nwho indicated that he noted a small defect in the this area of the specimen during intraoperative examination , an _ \n)thought there was a small amount of residual tumor In the corresponding adjacent tissue near Ihe adrenal gland. He \nthen resected the adrenal gland and surrounding soft tissue. No tumor was recognized grossly In the adrenal specimen \n(part 2) during pathologic examination and se<:tlonlng; the remaining tissue in part 2 will be submitted for histology, wlth \nttie result to follow In an addendumr It is mO$t likely that the final margin in the 60ft tiuue adjacent to the upper pole of \nthe kidney Is benign. \n-The small tumor fragment in the main renal artery lumen (section 1A) was not Identified grossly, and is not attached 10 \nthe wan of the artery. However, the tumo~ cells are surrounded by fibrin. It is not certain whether this represents a tumor \nthromboembolus or an artifaclually displaced tumor fragment occurring during sectioning .

The possibility that the right \nand left tumors represent primary and metastatic lesions cannot be entirely excluded, but this is less likely. If requested, \nmutational genotyping of the left and right tumors may be performed to compare the mutational profiles of these tumors, \nto more objectively determine whether they are more likely to be independent or related. \nPart 4; The specimen part number 4 labeled \"eleventh rib\" has been subjected to a gross examination only, If it is desired \nthat this specimen be processed for additional stUdies, particularly microscopic examination, it is suggested that the \ncase pathologist be notified within two weeks of the slgnout date of this report.

The tumor is well-defined, orange-yellow, and extends into the renal vein. However, the specific type of cancer has not been determined and further microscopic examination is required for a definitive diagnosis. The presence of benign lymph nodes suggests that the cancer has not yet spread to the lymphatic system. The rib and adrenal gland specimens may be unrelated to the kidney tumor, as they are received in separate containers and do not have any obvious connection to the renal neoplasm."

The attached portion of Inferior vena cava measures 0.6 cm in \nlength and 3.9 cm in diameter with a protruding mass measuring 6.3 x 5.1 x 3.1 em attached to the wall ofinferior vena cava and \ncompletely obliterative the renal vein. The portion of renal artery measures 2.7 em long and 0.4 em in diameter. The renal artery \nand ureter margins are grossty unremarkable. An adrenal gland is Identified, measures 5.5 x 3.5 x 1.3 em and grossly appears \nunremarkable. The perinephric fat is of thickness ranging from 0.4 to 1.7 em. The kidney is Inked black and bivalved to reveal an \nIrregular soft mass with variegated appearance, measures 12.2 x 9.8 x 8.9 em, involving the entire upper pole and portion of the \nmiddle pole of the kidney. The mass appears to involve the perinephric fat, renal sinus and perihilar fat and grossly extends into \nthe renal vessels. The pelviealiceal system at the upper pole is completely compressed, while at the middle and 10Vier poles, does \nnot appear to be involved by the mass. Two 0.5 em In diameter renal calculi are noted present in the middle pole. The remainder \nof the middle and lower pole shows a muitiloculated cyst 2.4 cm in greatest dimension, which cannot be separated from the upper \npole mass as no uninvolved renal parenchyma is grossly Identified. Sections through the remainder of the kidney reveal a pink \nPage 2 of 4  brown parenchyma, with a well\u00b7defined cortico\u00b7medullary junction. The cortex measures 0.6 em.

The main tumor mass is predominant ly papillary and solid with focal tubular areas. It is high grade. Focal areas of \nnecrosis are evident.

The main tumor mass is immunoreactive for CK7 and focally for racemase . 11 is negative for \nCAS. The satellite nodules are immunoreactive for CK7 but negative for racemase. BAF47 is not interpretable. The overall \nappearance is suggestive of a syndrome-associated tumor although the unusual morphology does not allow us to make this \nstatement with confidence or to suggest the syndrome involved, if such is the case.
