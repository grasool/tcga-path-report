CLINICAL HISTORY:
Malignant neoplasm of corpus uteri
GROSS EXAMINATION:
A. ""Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries"", received fresh for frozen
section and placed in formalin on is a 157
cm hysterectomy specimen with attached right and left adnexagmr . 1The uterine 3 2
serosa is tan-pink to red-brown and focally hemorrhagic. The cervix is 3.5 x
2.7 cm. The entocervical mucosa is gray-white, the cervical os is patent up
to 1.2 cm. The endocervical canal is obliterated by a tan-yellow to red-brown
necrotic fungating tumor mass which is 4.5 x 4 cm overall. The tumor mass
involves both the anterior and posterior endocervical canal. A representative
section of the anterior endocervical canal is submitted for frozen section as
AF1, the frozen section remnant is submitted in block Al. The endometrial
cavity is lined by tan granular endometrium which is 0.3 to 0.4 cm thick. The
tumor is minimally involving the posterior lower aspect of the endometrial
cavity. The endometrial cavity at the fundus displays a 3 x 1.8 cm
pedunculated polyp. Sectioning through the tumor reveals a tan-yellow to
tan-gray gritty cut surface which is approximately 1.5 cm thick at the
thickest myometrial region of up to 2 cm. The right ovary is 3.5 x 1.2 x 1
cm. The external surface is remarkable for several red-brown to gray fibrous
adhesions. The associated fallopian tube segment is 5 cm in length x 0.4 cm
in diameter. The serosal surface is remarkable for several intact paratubal
cysts. The left adnexa is remarkable for an abundant amount of gray
periadnexal soft tissue 4.8 x 3.5 x 2 cm. There is a segment of fallopiantube whichis 9 cm in length x 0.3 cm in diameter. Sectioning of the
periadnexal soft tissue reveals no identifiable ovarian parenchyma.

Page 3of3"," Site: Uterus
The report explicitly states that the tumor is located in the uterus.

Laterality: Not applicable
There is no indication of laterality in this report as it pertains to a location within the uterus which does not have a lateral aspect.

Histology: Endometrioid adenocarcinoma
The report clearly states that the tumor is an endometrioid adenocarcinoma.

Stage: IB (pT1b, N0)
The tumor has invaded more than half of the myometrium (pT1b), but there are no regional lymph node metastases (N0). According to FIGO staging for endometrial cancer, this would be classified as stage IB.

Grade: Grade 3
The tumor is described as a grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma.

Behavior: Malignant
The report indicates that the patient underwent hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy due to cancer, which suggests that the tumor is malignant.",Endometrioid adenocarcinoma,"IB (pT1b, N0)",Grade 3,Malignant,,,

GROSS EXAMINATION:
A. ""Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries (AF1)"", re ved fresh for
frozen section and transferred to formalin at 4M on is a 1B6 gram,
9.8 x 9.2 x 5.2 cm uterus. The cervix is amputated and per surgeon was
macerated during surgery. The separate portion of cervix measures 3.5 x 2.6 x
1.9 cm and demonstrates a tan smooth ectocervix with a 1.3 cm os. The
endocervical canal is covered with a tan-yellowmucosa which focally appears
friable. The endometrial cavity is 6.5 (cornu to cornu) x 7.3 cm (to point of
cervical amputation) is filled with a 7.8 x 5.5 x 2.1 cm friable fungating
mass. The tumor primarily involves the anterior wall but extends over the
fundus partially onto the posterior wall to within 1.1 cm of the amputation
site of the cervix. The tumor is focally necrotic and invades 1.1 cm into a
1.6 cm myometrium. A representative section of the tumor is frozen as AF1
(remnant Al). The remaining endometrium is tan and approximately 1 mm in
thickness. The myometrium which is on average 2 cm thick is tan and partially
trabeculated with one intramural white whorled nodule, up to 0.7 cm,
consistent with leiomyoma. The serosal surface is tan and smooth with no
gross abnormalities identified.
The right fallopian tube, 8.5 cm long is distally dilated to 1.7 cm in
diameter. Proximally, the diameter is 0.4 cm. The surface of the right
fallopian tube demonstrates focal yellow discoloration and opening the tube
reveals a cystically dilated tube with yellow studding of the luminal
surface. The cystic dilated portion is filled with brown-red liquid. The
right ovary, 3.5 x 1.5 x 1 cm, is grossly unremarkable. The left fallopian
tube, 8 cm long x 0.5 cm in diameter, and left ovary, 2.5 x 1.1 x 0.8 cm, are
grossly unremarkable.

COMMENT:
A representative block of the endometrial tumor (C8) is
submitted for immunohistochemical evaluation, given the presence
of tumor in both the endometrium and ovaries. The tumor shows
only scant scattered weak positive staining for WT1 and is
positive for E-cadherin. The predominant tumor in the
endometrium and the absence of strong positive staining for WT1
supports classification as a tumor of primary endometrial
origin.
Intraoperative Consult Diagnosis:
A frozen section was requested.

Gross Description
1. The specimen labeled with the patient's name and as ""Omentum: Omentum"". It consists of a
large unoriented segment of omentum, measuring 24.0 x 10.0 x 1.5 cm (weighing 103.2 g-fresh).
Cross-sections appear homogeneously yellow-tan and focally hemorrhagic. No distinct nodules
or tumors are grossly identified.
1A-1 E representative sections submitted
2. The specimen, labeled with the patient's name and as ""Uterus: Uterus, cervix, bilateral
salpingo-oophorectomy"". The specimen is received fresh and subsequently placed in 10%
buffered formalin. It consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral ovaries and fallopian
tubes; weighing 128.9 g (fresh). The body of the uterus is slightly distorted and measures 9.0 cm
SI x 5.5 cm ML x 5.2 cm AP. The serosal surface is pink-tan, focally hemorrhagic and smooth.
The cervix has a maximum diameter of 2.0 cm. The cervical Os measures 0.4 cm in maximum
diameter and has a ""slit-like"" shape. The uterus is bivalved. Both endo/myometrial layers are not
of uniform thickness. There is a large tumor occupying the entire endometrial cavity, measuring
8.7 cm SI x 4.5 cm ML x 5.0 cm AP. The tumor extends from the endometrial cavity to the lower uterine segment and towards the exocervix. Gross invasion into the myometrium is identified.
The cut surface of the tumor appears pale-tan, focally hemorrhagic and partially necrotic. The
distance from the tumor to the closest margins are as follows: 1.4 cm from the anterior exocervix,
0.9 cm from the posterior exocervix and <0.1 cm from the closest serosal surface (posterior
aspect). The cervical canal is patent and shows small amounts of mucoid material. The cervix
reveals a few Nabothian cysts, the largest measuring 0.2 cm in diameter. All of the Nabothian
cysts are filled with tan gelatinous material. The right ovary measures 2.0 x 1.1 x 0.9 cm. The
surface of the right ovary appears tan and slightly nodular. Cross sections show corpus albicans.
Within the right parovarian tissue, one poorly defined nodule is identified measuring 0.4 x 0.3 x
0.3 cm. The cut surface of the nodule appears homogeneously white, solid and firm. The right
fallopian tube measures 5.0 cm in length x 0.7 cm in diameter. The surface of the right fallopian
tube appears pink-tan and smooth, showing one para tubular cyst measuring 0.2 cm in maximum
dimension (filled with white milky fluid). Cross sections appear pale-tan and grossly
unremarkable. The left ovary measures 1.9 x 1.1 x 0.8 cm. The surface of the left ovary appears
tan and slightly nodular. Cross sections show corpus albicans. The left fallopian tube measures
5.5 cm in length x 0.6 cm in diameter. The surface of the left fallopian tube appears pink-tan and
smooth. Cross sections appear pale-tan and grossly unremarkable. Multiple sections from both
ovaries/ fallopian tubes, as well as two pieces of the endometrial tumor have been taken for
tissue banking. Representative sections are submitted as follows:

Justification: The specimen is labeled as ""Uterus: Uterus, cervix, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy"" and the gross description confirms the presence of a tumor in the endometrial cavity.

Laterality: Not provided
Justification: The tumor is present in the uterus, which is a midline structure and does not have laterality.

Histology: Endometrial carcinoma
Justification: The gross description mentions a ""large tumor occupying the entire endometrial cavity"" and the pathologic staging confirms the presence of invasive carcinoma in the endometrium.

Stage: IIIB (pT3b pNO)
Justification: The pathologic staging indicates that the tumor has invaded the vagina, rectal or bladder wall, or pelvic wall(s), but there is no regional lymph node metastasis.

Grade: Not provided
Justification: The pathologic report does not mention the grade of the tumor.

Behavior: Malignant
Justification: The tumor is an invasive carcinoma, which is a malignant neoplasm.",Endometrial carcinoma,IIIB (pT3b pNO),,Malignant,,,

invades into the outer half of the anterior myometrium but does not directly extend to
the uterine serosa; there is concurrent multifocal microscopic serosal tumor deposits
present on the anterior serosal surface (not in contiguity with the intrauterine
tumor). There is focal tumor involvement of the ovarian surface with associated
parenchymal tumor nodules in both ovaries. The lumen of the right distal fallopian
tube and fimbria is extensively involved and extended by multinodular tumor deposit.
While it is possible that the high-grade serous may have originated from the right
distal fallopian tube or alternatively that the tumors in the uterus and the right
fallopian tube represent synchronous primaries, the distribution of the disease is
most in keeping with a uterine primary that subsequently metastasized to the different
extra-uterine sites.This is also supported by the immunostaining findings that both the uterine tumor and the right tubal tumor show only weak focal nuclear WT1
immunoreactivity, in contrast to the usually strong and diffuse WT1 immunoreactivity
observed in the great majority of primary ovarian/tubal serous carcinomas.

Gross Description:
Received are four containers, each labelled with the patient's name, XXXXXXXXXXX and
demographics.
Container A is labelled RIGHT PELVIC LYMPH NODES and consists of multiple pieces of
fibrofatty tissue aggregating to 7 x 2.5 x 0.5 cm. Two lymph nodes are identified
within the fibrofatty tissue measuring 2 x 1.3 x 0.5 cm and 2 x 0.7 x 0.2 cm,
respectively and are submitted in toto in cassettes Al and A2. The remainder of the
fibrofatty tissue is submitted in cassettes A3 and A4.
Container B is labelled LEFT PELVIC LYMPH NODE and consists of multiple pieces of
fibrofatty tissue aggregating to 4.5 x 3 x 1 cm. Two lymph nodes are identified
within, one measuring 2 x 1 x 0.4 cm and the other measuring 1.9 x 0.8 x 0.4 cm. They
are sectioned and submitted in B1 and B2, respectively. The remainder of the
fibrofatty tissue is submitted in B3 and B4.
Container C is labelled UTERUS, CERVIX BILATERAL TUBES, AND OVARIES and consists of a
total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy specimen. The uterus measures
4.4 x 3.6 x 2.5 cm, left fallopian tube measures 5.6 x 0.5 cm, left ovary measures 2 x
1x 1.3 cm, right fallopian tube measuring 6 x 0.5 cm at its attachment site to the
uterus, dilating up to 1.5 cm at its fimbriated end, right ovary measuring 2 x 1 x 0.5
cm.
The serosal surface is tan-brown, smooth, shiny, and free of any adhesions. The
ectocervix measures 1.8 x 2.4 cm and it is covered by a glistening white mucosa. The
external os is slit-like and measures 0.7 cm. The endocervical canal measures 2.1 cm
and involved by a friable tumor in the proximal region. The same friable white
exophytic tumor is present, diffusely involving the endometrial cavity. On cute
sections, the tumor invades into the out half of the anterior myometrium (to within
0.3 cm of the serosal surface) but does not extend to the serosa.
Left fallopian tube is unremarkable. The left ovary is multinodular and cystic and
there are several golden areas which grossly resemble the appearance of corpora lutea.
The right fallopian tube has multiple nodules towards its fimbriated end, the largest
of which measures 1 cm in diameter. Cut sections through the nodules show a white,
soft mass with a central area of hemorrhage. These nodules appear to be mostly
contained within the lumen of the fallopian tube. There are also several cystic
spaces near the fimbriated end, the largest measuring 0.7 cm in diameter, filled with
a mucinous-like material. The right ovary is multinodular and golden in appearance,
and otherwise unremarkable. Representative sections are submitted as follows:
Cl-C2 -representative sections of left ovary
C3-C4 -representative sections of left fallopian tube
C5-C6 -right ovary submitted in toto
C7-C10 -Right fallopian tube mass, submitted in toto

depth from endometrial surface to tumor base). It is friable and has
a white-tan cut surface with hemorrhagic areas. It extends from the
anterior aspect of the endometrial cavity in the fundic/cornu region
to within 1.6 cm of the peritoneum over the anterior portion of the
uterus. The mass extends to within 2.1 cm of the anterior peritoneal
surface of the uterus Sectioning through the myometrium
reveals numerous tan-white whorled, well circumscribed nodules without
areas of hemorrhage, necrosis, or degeneration. The largest of these
nodules measures 10 cm in greatest dimension. The right fallopian

Comment:This serous carcinoma is considered to be of endometrial origin
since morphology of tumor is the same in endometrium and
ovaries, endometrial tumor is large while ovarian is small, there is deep myometrial invasion and lymphovascular
space invasion, tumor involves bilateral ovaries, several small
foci are seen in each ovary, and there is ovarian surface
involvement as well as parenchymal involvement.
Immunohistochemical stain for CD31 supports both lymphovascular
space invasion and myometrial tumor with artifactual clearing
around invasive tumor foci.

Grade: Not provided
Behavior: Malignant (invasive serous carcinoma found in the ovary and endometrium)

Justification: The patient was diagnosed with endometrial cancer, and the pathology report shows involvement of both ovaries and the endometrium by serous carcinoma. The stage is determined based on the AJCC Pathologic Stage provided (pT3a), but FIGO stage grouping is not explicitly given in the report. The grade is also not provided, so it cannot be determined. The behavior of this tumor is malignant due to its invasive nature and the involvement of multiple sites.",Serous carcinoma,pT3a (based on AJCC Pathologic Stage),,Malignant (invasive serous carcinoma found in the ovary and endometrium),,,

DIAGNOSIS:
A. Uterus, hysterectomy: FIGO grade 1 (of 3) endometrial
adenocarcinoma, endometrioid and villoglandular type, is
identified
forming a mass (2.5 x 2.0 x 0.7 cm), located in the
posterior
uterine wall. The tumor invades 0.6 cm into the
myometrium (total
wall thickness 1.8 cm). Lymphovascular space invasion is
not
identified. The tumor does not involve the endocervix.
The margins
are negative for tumor.
B. Fallopian tube, left, salpingectomy: The left
fallopian tube is
without diagnostic abnormality.
C. Ovary and fallopian tube, right, salpingo-
oophorectomy: The
right ovary and fallopian tube are without diagnostic
abnormality.
Frozen section histologic interpretation performed by:
M.D.
ED. Ovary, left, oophorectomy: The left ovary is without
diagnostic
abnormality.
E. Lymph nodes, right pelvic, lymphadenectomy: Multiple
(12) right
pelvic lymph nodes are negative for tumor. Frozen section
histologic interpretation performed by:
M. D.
F. Lymph nodes, left pelvic, lymphadenectomy: Multiple
(22) left pelvic lymph nodes are negative for tumor.
With available surgical material [AJCC pTlaNO] (7th
edition, 2010).
This final pathology report is based on the
gross/macroscopic
examination and frozen section histologic evaluation of
the
specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent
sections are
reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive
changes
identified on permanent section review will be reflected
in a
revised report.
GROSS DESCRIPTION:

Justification: The site is identified as the uterus based on the description of the specimen. The laterality is not provided, but it is not relevant in this case since a hysterectomy involves removing the entire uterus. The histology is given as endometrioid adenocarcinoma, which is a type of malignant tumor that arises from the endometrium. The stage is not explicitly provided, but based on the description of lymph node involvement, it may be at least stage II. The grade is given as FIGO Grade 2, which indicates an intermediate level of differentiation for the tumor cells.

I certify that I personally conducted the diagnostic evaluation of the abovespecimen (s) and have rendered the above diagnosis(es).
COMMENT :
It is not possible to determine a primary site with certainty. The
endometrial tumor is non-invasive ,while the ovarian tumor is primarily on the
surface. Given that the endometrium has the largest single deposit of
carcinoma (4.0 cm)compared with the small volume of tumor at the otherinvolved sites ,however, an endometrial primary is favored.
ADDENDUM 1:
The tumor is unreactive for Wilm's tumor gene (WT-1), which supports the
other pathology findings that the primary tumor is endometrial in origin.
See Hashi A et al, Wilms tumor gene immunoreactivity in primary serous
carcinomas of the fallopian tube ,ovary, endometriam ,and peritoneum.

Comments
Sections of endometrium demonstrate a predominantly endometrioid
adenocarcinoma with focal clear cells and focal mucinous
differentiation .This Is graded as a moderate to poorly
differentiated, FIGO grade 2-3. Sections of cervix and right
parametrium show fragments of carcinoma outside of the plane of
sections of the tumor which are interpreted as ""floaters.""
The right ovary grossly was multi -cystic. Microscopically, a large
portion of the cyst demonstrate the lining epithelium to be
artifactually denuded . Focally, some residual lining epithelium is
present with focally some mucinous cells and in other areas columnar
epithelial cells. Focally , within the wall is some bone formation
as well as skin adnexal structures although no squamous epithelium
is identified . The overall histologic features are suggestive of a
mature cystic teratoma. No carcinoma is identified . Clinical
correlation and follow up is recommended.
At the request of the undersigned pathologist, these slides have
been additionally reviewed by Dr. IM who concurs with the
diagnosis.
This test has been finalized at the Campus.

COMMENT :The keratin positivity noted in the prior biopsy is entirely consistent with
leiomyosarcoma .Although some foci (A15) showed cells which resemble
rhabdomyoblasts ,MyoD1 is negative .No glandular component is identified in the
resection specimen and no keratin positivity is identified in a section stained from this
case ,which argue against a malignant mixed mullerian tumor .The findings were relayed

A. UTERUS, BILATERAL TUBES, OVARIES AND CERVIX
Labeled with the patient 's name ,labeled ""uterus, bilateral tubes ,ovaries and cervix "",received fresh for
intraoperative gross consultation, and subsequently fixed in formalin is a 190 gram total hysterectomy
and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy specimen. The uterus is about 7.5 x 6.0 x 6.0 cm. The cervical
portion of the uterus is 2.5 x 2.5 x 2.2 cm. The endometrial cavity is about 4.0 cm wide and about 4.0 cm
in length. The endometrial lining is 0.1 cm. The muscular uterine wall ranges from 1.2 to 2.0 cm in
maximum thickness. There are parametrial tissues attached to the uterus. Those on the right are about
2.5 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm and hose on the left are about 2.5 x 12 x 0.8 cm. The right ovary is. 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm.
A 1.3 x 0.7 x 02 cm portion of right ovary appears to have been previously removed for research
purposes. The right fallopian tube is 4.5 cm in length and 0.3-0.5 cm in diameter. The lumen is 0.1 cm.
The left ovary is 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm. The left fallopian tube is 4.5 cm in length and 0.4-0.6 cm in diameter.
The lumen is 0.1 cm.
There is a soft, tan, friable, hemorrhagic, pedunculated 5.5 x 5.0 x 3.5 cm endometrial tumor that largely
replaces the uterine fundus, corpus, and lower uterine segment. The tumor invades greater than 95% of
the myometrial wall in the lower uterine segment (grossly 2.0 cm into a 2.0 cm myometrial wall), The
tumor abuts the serosa of the anterior and posterior lower uterine segment but does not grossly extend
through the serosa. The tumor does not grossly extend into the ectocervix or parametrial soft tissues. A
1.0 x 0.7 x 0.3 cm nodule is present in the posterior endocervical wall, possibly representing tumor versus
post-fixation artifact. The endocervical canal is otherwise uninvolved by tumor. No metastatic tumor is
identified in the adnexa.

Justification: The patient was diagnosed with endometrial carcinoma in the uterus, which has extended to the cervix and lower uterine segment. There is also evidence of tumor involvement in both ovaries, fallopian tubes, and the omentum. Based on this information, the cancer is considered malignant, with a high grade and extensive spread throughout multiple sites. The lack of lymph node information prevents a more precise staging, but based on the depth of myometrial invasion, it has been classified as pT2Nx.",Mixed endometrioid and serous carcinoma,pT2Nx,Grade 3,"Malignant (the patient was diagnosed with a malignancy, as evidenced by the involvement of multiple sites)",,,

Comment
Tumor demonstrated two architectural pattern with glandular and papillary structures merging
with solid sheets. The solid component occupies more than 50% of total. Focal squamous
differentiation is identified. Focally tumor cells show very high-grade nuclei and bizarre nuclear
morphology.
Immunohistochemistry staining shows glandular areas show positive staining with ER but weak
focal staining with p53 and negative staining with p16. The solid areas show negative staining
with ER but patchy positive staining with p53 and patchy positive staining with p16. The overall
morphological and immunohistochemistry features of this tumour is consistent with grade 3/3
endometrioid adenocarcinoma of endometrium.

Clinical History:
presents with abnormal appearing uterus at the time of hysterectomy.
Gross Description:
Received are five appropriately labeled containers.
Container A:
Comment :The uterus and bilateral tubes and ovaries are received partially morcellated and markedly disrupted. Therefore ,determining anterior from posterior is impossible .Determining grossly where the lower uterine segment is
located is also not possible .Of note ,only one of the ovaries and fallopian tubes is identified attached to the specimen.
The cervix and endocervical canal are received separately in the container.
Adnexa :One ovary is identified attached to its fallopian tube. A fragmented piece of separately discovered fallopian
tube is also appreciated .The second ovary is not discovered.
Weight :431 grams
Shape :cannot be determined due to morcellation
Dimensions :Because the specimen is morcellated ,the usual dimensions cannot be appreciated. The specimen measures
in aggregate 8.0 x 5 .0 x 5.0 cm.
Serosa :The serosal surface that can be appreciated is pink ,dull and significant for several subserosal candidate
leiomyomata (measuring less than 1.0 cm in maximum dimension).
Cervix :The separately submitted cervix demonstrates a white ectocervix with petechial hemorrhages.
length of endocervical canal: cannot be determined due to morcellations
endocervix: 4.0 cm
Endomyometrium:
length of endometrial cavity: estimated at 4.0 cm
width of endometrial cavity at fundus: 3.5 cm
tumor findings:
dimensions: The serially sectioned tumor that is appreciated measures 4.0 x 3 .0 x 1.0 cm.
appearance :The tumor is white ,soft, friable, and exophytic.
location and extent :The tumor is present in the uterine corpus that is appreciated. As stated ,extension to the lower
uterine segment cannot be appreciated.

Multiple pieces were taken for tissue bank."," Site: Uterus
Justification: The specimen is labeled as ""Uterus: Uterus, tubes and ovaries"" and multiple sections were taken from the endometrium and myometrium.

Laterality: Not provided
Justification: The label does not specify if the uterine corpus with attached cervix is from the left or right side of the body.

Histology: Adenocarcinoma
Justification: A fungating tan-brown friable tumor mass was found on the anterior and posterior endometrium, which suggests a malignant neoplasm such as adenocarcinoma.

Stage: Not provided
Justification: The stage of cancer cannot be determined from the gross description alone and would require additional information such as the extent of invasion into surrounding tissues or the presence of metastasis.

Grade: Not provided
Justification: The grade of cancer cannot be determined from the gross description alone and would require microscopic examination of tissue sections to assess the degree of differentiation.

Behavior: Malignant
Justification: A malignant neoplasm was identified based on the gross description, indicating that the behavior is malignant.",Adenocarcinoma,,,Malignant,,,

tubes weighing114 grams. The uterus and cervix measure 8 .4 cm from superior to inferior x 5.5 cm from comu to comu x 4.5 cm from anterior to posterior. The cervix Itself measures3.2 x 3.5 x 2.5 cm. The serosal surface of the uterus Is tan-pink to purple and unremarkable. The ectocervix measures 3.0 x 2.8 cm. The cervical os Is silt-like, measuring 0.9 x 0.3 cm. The ectocervix is tan-pink and slightly hemorrhagic. Nabothian cysts are noted at the 8 to 8
o'clock position. The uterus and cervix have been previously opened. The endometrial cavity Is expanded by a tumormass. The endometrlal cavity measures 4.0 x 5.0 cm. The tumormeasures4.2 x 4.1 x 3.3 cm. The tumor Involvesboth the anterior and the posterior endometrium. It Is predominantly on the anterior endometrlum. The tumor is
tan-yellow to gray and polypoid. Seriallysectioning through the tumor reveals another area of significant myometrialinvasion, where the tumor appears to Invade Into the myometrium ate depth of 1.1 cm, where the entire myometrialwall thickness is 1.2 cm. A circumscribednodular massIs located within the myometrium of the anterior, lower, andmid-uterine segment. On cut surface, it has a white-pink, whorledtexture .It measures 1.5 x 0.9 x 1.3 cm. It most resembles a well circumscribedleiomyoma. The portion of myometrium not Involved by tumor measures 1.4 cm in
thickness. The remainder of the endometrium that does not appear to be Involved by tumor measures - 0.2 cm Inthickness. The tumor approaches the lower uterinesegment at the borderbetween the middle and lower uterine segment. It ties 1.7 cm from the endocervical canal. The endocervicalcanal measures 2.2 cm in length x 1.4 cm. Theendocervical mucosa Is tan-pink and contains some endocervlcal cysts. The right ovarymeasures 2.2 x 1.4 x 1.0 cm. The serosal surface Is tan-pink to yellow and unremarkable . The right fallopian tube measures 5.2 cm In length with an average diameterof 0.5 cm. There are multiple associated paratubal cysts, ranging from 0.1 x 0.2 x < 0.1 cm to 0.5 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm. The fallopiantube lumen 1s pinpoint and the fallopian tube wall thickness Is 0.2 cm.

CLINICAL HISTORY:
Malignant neoplasm corpus uteri.
GROSS EXAMINATION:A. ""Uterus, bilateral tubes and ovaries"", received fresh and placed in
formalin on at pm is a markedly disrupted fragmented uterus with
attached bilateral adnexa, 235 grams overall. The cervix is received in
several fragments as well as several additional separate nodules consistent
with leiomyomata. The uterine corpus is 9.5 x 9.5 x 8.2 cm overall. The
endometrial cavity is remarkable for a tan, fungating, friable tumor mass
which is approximately 3.5 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm. Due to the fragmented appearance
of the uterus, anterior and posterior endometrial walls cannot be cut
ascertained. Sectioning through the tumormassreveals a tan-gray-white
surface. The tumormassis approximately 1.1 cm thick at its thickest
myometrial of up to 2.6 cm. The myometrium is tan, trabeculated, and is
remarkable for numerous leiomyomata, the largest of which is 6.5 cm in
greatest dimension. The cut surfaces of the leiomyomata are white, whorled,
no hemorrhage or necrosis is grossly noted. Additionally received in the same
container are two fragments of tissue compatible with disrupted cervix, the
cervix is 3.5 x 2.5 cm overall, the endocervical canal is unremarkable. Also
received are several well-circumscribed leiomyomata, the largest of which is 4
cm in greatest dimension. The cut surfaces are white, whorled, and no
hemorrhage or necrosis is noted. The presumed left ovary is 2.7 x 1.5 x 0.9
cm. The external surface is tan-yellow and corrugated. The associated
fallopian tube segment is 4.5 cm long x 0.4 an in diameter. One end is
blunted, the opposing end contains tan-pink fimbria. Sectioning of the ovary
discloses a tan-yellow, 1.1 cm cyst. The remaining ovarian parenchyma is
unremarkable. The presumed right ovary is tan-yellow, 1.5 x 1.3 x 1 cm and
displays a cerebriform external surface. The associated fallopian tube
segment is 3.5 cm long x 0.4 cm in diameter. One end is blunted, the opposing
end contains tan-pink, delicate fimbria. The cutsurfaceceeoflthecoovary
severaldiscloses a tan-yellow, homogeneous cut surface, with
thin-walled cysts,the largest of which is 0.2 cm in greatest dimension.

MOLECULAR RESULTS
Endometrial carcinoma, microsatellite instability testing:
Microsatellite-stable tumor (see technical report).
Intact (positive) nuclear expression of MI-H1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 by immunohistochemistry.
TECHNICAL REPORT
DNA extracted from microdissected paraffin-embedded tumor (T) in sections from block B5 and non-neoplastic tissue (N) from
block B16 was analyzed by a PCR-based method followed by capillary electrophoretic detection. A panel of seven microsatellite
markers recommended by the NCI (BAT25, BAT26, BAT40, D2S123, D5S346, D17S250 and TGFBR2) was evaluated to detect
changes in the number of microsatellite repeats in tumor as compared to normal tissue. No allelic shift was detected in the tested
microsatellite markers.
Immunohistochemistry for MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 was performed using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of
the endometrial carcinoma.
""This test was developed and its performance determined byencleared or approved by the U .S. Food and Drug Administration .The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. This test is used fo

F. UTERUS AND CERVIX
Labeled with the patient 's name ,labeled ""uterus and cervix "",and received fresh in the Operating Room for
intraoperative gross consultation and subsequently fixed in formalin and is a 270 gram total hysterectomy specimen.
The uterus is about 10.0 x 9.5 x 8.5 cm in greatest overall dimensions with the cervical portion measuring about 3.5
cm in length and up to 2.5 cm in diameter .The external cervical os is patent and 0.5 cm in diameter. The
endometrial cavity is 6.0 cm long and up to 5.0 cm in width. The muscular uterine wall has a maximum thickness
of about 2.5 cm.
The endometrial cavity is partially replaced by friable pink -tan tumor . The tumor measures about 13.0 x 9.0 cm in
area,involves the uterine fundus, the entire anterior and posterior corpus and the posterior lower uterine segment.
In the latter area the tumor extends very close to the endocervical /lower uterine segment junction .No gross tumor
is seen in the cervix .Cut sections of the uterus reveal invasion of greater than 50% of the uterine wall. Invasive
tumor extends to within about 0.3 cm of the serosal surface of the uterus .No involvement of uterine serosa or
parametrial tissues by tumor is evidence.
There is scant uninvolved endometrial mucosa in the anterior lower uterine corpus and lower uterine segment,
which measures about 0.1 cm in thickness .Within the uterus ,there are seven well-circumscribed leiomyomas,
ranging from about 0.5 to 2.5 cm in maximum dimensions ,three of which are subserosal and the remainder of
which are intramural .One of the intramural leiomyomas is located in the anterior lower uterine corpus and lower
uterine segment .One of the smaller leiomyomas has a semi-firm white rubbery cut surface. The other leiomyomas
have firm solid tan -white whorled cut surfaces .No areas of hemorrhage or necrosis are evident in any of the
leiomyomas .A focus of friable tumor measuring about 0.5 cm in diameter is present in the largest leiomyoma. The
mucosa of the cervix appears partly defective /eroded .Several mucus -filled cysts ,up to about 0.2 cm is diameter are
also noted in the cervix.

PATHOLOGY #:
Part F received fresh labeled 1 and ""uterus ,tubes ,and ovaries ""consists of a uterus with attached cervix and
left and right fallopian tube.
The uterus measures 8 cm superior to inferior ,7 cm laterally ,and 2 .5 cm anterior to posterior and weighs 160
grams .The left anterior serous has a 3 x 2.5 x 0 .3 cm irregular tan yellow irregular ulcerated mass attached to the left round
ligament and a 0.5 x 0 .4 x 0.3 cm nodule 0.8 cm inferior to mass.
The uterus is inked as follows :anterior -green, posterior -yellow, and the cervix is amputated and the uterus is
bisected into anterior and posterior halves revealing an irregular papillary mass primarily within the anterior endometrial
cavity measuring 2 x 2 cm. After inking, the cut sections ofthe mass on the serosal surface are tan-yellow. Cut sections of
the smaller tan nodule are well circumscribed and tan-white The myometrium measures 1.3 cm in maximal thickness and the
tumor is seen to invade to a thickness of 1.3 cm in the anterior endomyometrium. The myometrium in the posterior portion
measures 0.5 cm and the tumor is seen to invade to a thickness of 0.3 cm Cut sections of the remaining tnyometrium are
tan-pink and smooth .No other nodules are seen.
The cervical margin is irregular, disrupted and friable with multiple papillary areas .This area measures 5.5 x
5 cm. The amputated cervix is opened at the 12:00 position and sectioned clockwise and entirely submitted.
The left ovary measures 3 x 2 x 1 cm and weighs 3 grams. Cut sections of the left ovary are tan-pink with a central
tan-yellow area measuring t x 0.8 x 0.2 cm .The left fallopian tube is irregular and thickened and consists mainly of distal
fimbriated end measuring 3.5 x 03 cm.
. The right ovary measures2 x 2 x 0 .3 cm and weighs 2 grams. The right fallopian tube measures 4 x 0.5 cm Cut . .
sections of the right ovary are tan -pink . .
SUMMARY OF SECTIONS: FI and F2.- tumor with anterior endomyometrium; F3 and F4 - tumor with posterior
endomyometrium; F5 through F7 - irregular area on serosal surface; F8 - nodule on serosal surface; F9 - right ovary and
fallopian tube; F10 - left ovary and fallopian tube; F11 - right side of cervix; F12 - left side of cervix. The cervix is entirely
submitted as follows. F13 and F14 -1:00; F15 and F16 - 2:00; F17 - 3:00; F18 - 4:00; F19 - 5:00; F20 - 6:00; F21 and F22

MICROSCOPIC: A poorly differentiated papillary serous adenocarcinoma of the endometrium is seen infiltrating
throughout the myometruun and out onto the serosal surface. There is extensive vascular invasion. The neoplasm is also
seen to involve cervix including endoccrvical glands and cervical stromal invasion. The left ovary and fallopian tube are
also infiltrated by tumor as well as the left and right sides of the cervix. The tumor shows extensive necrosis, poorly formed
glands and extensive single cell infiltration. Lymphovascular space involvement is seen throughout the sections.

SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT
Page 3 of 4"," Site: Uterus, left ovary, left fallopian tube, and cervix
Justification: The report describes a papillary serous adenocarcinoma primary in the endometrium, which has invaded the myometrium, serosal surface, and cervix, as well as the left ovary and fallopian tube.

Laterality: Left
Justification: The tumor is present in the left ovary, left fallopian tube, and left iliac and obturator lymph nodes.

Histology: Papillary serous adenocarcinoma
Justification: This is stated explicitly in the report as the diagnosed tumor type.

Stage: Not provided
Justification: The report does not provide enough information to determine the stage of the cancer, such as whether there is evidence of metastasis beyond the pelvis.

Grade: FIGO grade 3
Justification: The report describes the tumor as poorly differentiated and having extensive necrosis, which are features consistent with a high-grade tumor.

Behavior: Malignant
Justification: This is indicated by the diagnosis of papillary serous adenocarcinoma, which is an aggressive type of cancer that can invade surrounding tissues and metastasize to distant sites.",Papillary serous adenocarcinoma,,FIGO grade 3,Malignant,,,

Comments
Histologic sections from the endometrial neoplasm demonstrate a
tumor comprised of large epithelial cells with marked pleomorphism
and prominent nuclear atypia. In areas there is glanular and
pseudo-glandular growth as noted ;however ,much of the neoplasm is
composed of sheet-like growth of these neoplastic cells with no
discernible glandular formation .The overall histologic
characteristics are those of a poorly differentiated (grade 3)
endometrial adenocarcinoma. Clinical correlation is recommended. At the request of the undersigned pathologist ,these slides have
been additionally reviewed by Dr .- who concurs with the
diagnosis.

Labeled with the pateen s name, designated ""uterus, cervix"",
received fresh in the Operating Room for intraoperative gross
consultation and subsequently fixed in formalin is an 84 gram total
hysterectomy specimen. The uterus measures about 7.4 cm from the
fundus to the ectocervix, 3.8 cm from cornu to cornu, and up to 4.1
cm from the anterior surface to the posterior surface. The uterine
serosa is tan-red, and generally smooth except for procedure-related
artifact. Attached to the uterus, there is a small amount of pink-
tan firm parametrial soft tissue. The parametrial soft tissues,
bilaterally, appears grossly free of tumor. The cervix is about 2.8
cm long and has a maximum diameter of 1.9 cm in the ectocervical
region. The mucosa lining the ectocervix is tan and smooth. The
external cervical os is patent and about 0.9 cm in diameter. The
uterus was previously incised on both sides at the time of the
intraoperative consult. The cervical transformation zone is
distinct. The endocervical canal is about 2.1 cm long and lined forPage 2 of 6 Page 3 of 6
(coythe most part by slightly rugose tan mucosa. In the posterior
endocervix, there are two tiny endocervical polyps, measuring about
0.2 and 0.3 cm in maximum dimension, each is composed of semi-soft
tan-white tissue. Cut sections of the cervix reveal multiple mucus-
filled cysts ranging from about 0.1 to 0.3 cm in diameter. The
cervix appears grossly free of tumor. The endometrial cavity is
about 5.0 cm long and up to 3.0 cm in diameter. The endometrial
cavity is largely occupied by an exophytic polypoid pale tan tumor
mass that has a friable and focally papillated surface. The tumor
mass measures about 4.2 x 3.0 cm in surface area and has a maximum
thickness of about 1.6 cm, including exophytic and endophytic
components. extensively involves the uterine fundus, anterior
uterine corpus, posterior uterine corpus, and extends into the
posterior lower uterine segment. Upon sectioning the uterus,
invasive carcinoma is seen involving the fundus, posterior uterine
corpus and anterior uterine corpus. In the posterior fundus
and posterior corpus, greater than 50% of the wall thickness is
involved by tumor. Tumor in the anterior uterus and in the posterior
lower uterine segment is more superficially invasive (involves less
than 50% of the wall thickness). Within the uterus, mostly in the
lower anterior corpus and lower uterine segment, there is a small
amount of uninvolved tan endometrium that has a maximum thickness of
less than 0.1 cm. Within the uterus, there are five sharply
circumscribed intramural leiomyomas that measure about 0.3, 0.5,
0.6, 1.2 and 1.5 cm in maximum dimensions. The smallest and second
smallest leiomyomas are in the fundus. The third smallest
leiomyoma is located in the anterior lower uterine segment. The
largest and second largest leiomyomas are located in the posterior
uterine corpus. The largest and second largest leiomyomas have firm
white cut surfaces without grossly evident areas of hemorrhage
or necrosis. The second largest leiomyoma is partially calcified.
The smallest and second smallest leiomyomas have firm tan-white
whorled cut surfaces without grossly evident areas of hemorrhage or
necrosis. The uninvolved myometrium is semi-firm, tan-pink, up
to 1.8 cm in thickness and shows trabeculations and focal minute
cystic spaces suggestive of adenomyosis.

Gross Descrogt oon:A.Received fresh labeled with the patient's name and ""uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries"" is a 154 gram hysterectomy
specimen, measuring 10.5 x 6.2 x 4.2 cm. The specimen is opened to reveal a 4.5 x 3.2 cm fungating mass located
predominantly in the posterior endometrium. Within the anterior and posterior myometrium is a 5.2 x 5.1 x 5.0 cm circumscribed
tan-white whorled nodule, grossly consistent with a leiomyoma. This leiomyoma is compressing up against and displacing the
majority of the endometrium. The endometrial cavity measures 3.5 x 2.5 cm and the endocervical cavity measures 3.2 x 0.9 cm.
The uterus is serially sectioned to reveal an average endometrial thickness of 0.1 cm and an average myometrial thickness of 1.4
cm. Grossly, the mass is invading 0.3 cm into the myometrium. Representative sections of the uterus are submitted as follows:
Al 12:00 cervix.
A2 6:00 cervix.
A3 Anterior lower uterine segment.
A4 Posterior lower uterine segment
A5 Full thickness anterior wall.
A6 One full thickness section from the mass in the posterior wall.
A7-A8 One full thickness section of the mass from the posterior wall (bisected).
A9 One additional representative section of the mass from the posterior wall.
A10 A representative section from the leiomyoma.
Attached to the uterus is a 4.5 cm in length by 0.6 cm in diameter tan-pink fallopian tube that is serially sectioned to reveal an
unremarkable pinpoint lumen. Proximately there is 0.6 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm circular piece of plastic. Representative sections from the
right fallopian tube are submitted in cassette A11. Adjacent to the fallopian tube is a 2.6 x 2.1 x 1.2 cm smooth, tan-white ovary
that is bivalved to reveal a variegated tan-white cut surface. One-half of the ovary is submitted in cassette A12.
Also attached to the uterus is a 4.2 cm in length by 0.6 cm in diameter fimbriated left fallopian tube. The external surface is
smooth, tan-pink and unremarkable. The tube is serially sectioned to reveal an unremarkable pinpoint lumen. Representative
sections from the left fallopian tube are submitted in cassette A13. Adjacent to the left fallopian tube is a 2.1 x 1.8 x 0.6 cm
tan-white ovary that is bivalved to reveal a variegated tan-white cut surface. One-half is submitted in cassette A14.
B.Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and ""left pelvic lymph node"" is a 4.7 x 1.8 x 0.8 cm aggregate of
yellow tan adipose tissue. The specimen is palpated to reveal seven possible lymph nodes ranging in size from 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm
to 1.5 x 1.2 x 0.5 cm. The lymph nodes are submitted as follows:
131 Four possible lymph nodes.
B2 Two possible lymph nodes.
B3 One possible lymph node.
C.Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and ""right pelvic lymph nodes"" is a 3.2 x 2.5 x 0.5 cm aggregate of
yellow tan adipose tissue. The tissue is palpated to reveal 12 possible lymp nodes ranging in size from 0.4 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm to 1.8 x
0.5 x 0.4 cm. The lymph nodes are submitted as follows:
C1 Four possible lymph nodes.
C2 Four possible lymph nodes.
C3 Three possible lymph nodes.
C4 Two possible lymph nodes.
D.Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and ""left para-aortic, common lymph node"" is a 1.9 x 0.6 x 0.3 cm
aggregate of yellow-tan adipose tissue. The specimen is entirely submitted in cassette D1.
E. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and ""right para-aortic lymph node"" are four tan-pink, firm lymph nodes
ranging in size from 1.0 x 0.7 x 0.4 cm to 1.7 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm. These lymph nodes are submitted as follows:
El Two lymph nodes.

GROSS EXAMINATION:
A. ""Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries (AF1)"", received fresh for
frozen section is a 126 gram, 8.2 x 6.5 x 3.1 cm uterus with attached
bilateral adnexa. The deep soft tissue is inked blue. The serosa is
tan-gray, smooth and glistening. The uterus is bivalved to reveal a 3.1 x 2.6
x 1.1 cm tan, sessile, firm mass with a friable surface overlying the
endometrium at the fundus and extending into anterior and posterior
endometrial cavities. The mass grossly appears to invade 0.2 cm into a 1.2 cmthick myometrium.The mass doesnot extend to the cervix (2.6 cm at closest
approach from the posterior half). The uninvolved endometrium is otherwise
tan, smooth and with multiple less than 0.1 cm cysts. The 0.1 cm thick
endometriam overlies a 1 cm in average thickness unremarkable myometrium. The
cervix (2.9 cm in diameter with a 1.1 cm patent os) has an unremarkable ecto
and endocervical mucosa. A representative of the mass is frozen as AF1. The
frozen section remnant is submitted in block Al.

Gross Description
A. Received in formalin labeled - uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries"" is a previously opened uterus and cervix
with attached right and left fallopian tubes and ovaries, 336.0 grams. The uterus is symmetrical in configuration, 11.0 cm in
length, 7.5 cm in broadest extent, and up to 5.5 cm anterior-posteriorly. The serosa is pink-tan, smooth and glistening. The
cervix with attached vaginal cuff is 4.0 x 4.0 x 4.0 cm, and appears grossly normal. A portion of the cervix has been removed
intraoperatively and submitted for cancer research. Cross sectioningreveals a thin pink, slightly hemorrhagic endometrium,
0.1 cm in greatest thickness. A portion of the endometrium has been removed intraoperatively and submitted for cancer
research. Situated along the posterior aspect of the endometrial canal is a friable, red-tan polypoid lesion, 3.5 x 3.5 cm
across. The cut surface of the tumor reveals it to be grossly confined to the endometrium. At this level, the myometrium is at
least 2.5 cm in thickness. There is an area of circumscribed nodularity in the uterine wall, grossly consistent with a lelomyoma
of 1.0 cm. The right and left fallopian tubes are unremarkable. The right and left ovaries are each approximately 2.0 x 1.5 x
1.0 cm, and appear grossly normal. A portion of each ovary has been removed intraoperatively and submitted for cancer
research. Representative sections, blocks Al-A13.

COMMENT:
Immunostains for pancytokeratin (AE1/AE3) are performed on
several lymph nodes
to rule out micrometastases (E5, El, E2, and D7). Focal
micrometastatic
adenocarcinoma is noted in one node in block E5 (the rest of the
immunostains
show no evidence of metastatic carcinoma).

Stage: Not determined in this report
Grade: Grade I-II for endometrial adenocarcinoma, not graded for cervical carcinoma
Behavior: Malignant

Justification: The report describes an endometrioid adenocarcinoma in the uterus with superficial muscle invasion and a separate invasive carcinoma in the cervix. The stage is not provided, but based on the description of the tumor involving less than 50% of the muscular wall thickness in the superior aspect of the specimen, it may be an early-stage cancer. The grade for the endometrial adenocarcinoma is given as I-II/III, indicating a well to moderately differentiated tumor. The grade for the cervical carcinoma is not provided. Overall, the behavior of these tumors is malignant, as they have invaded the muscular wall of the uterus and cervix, respectively.","Endometrioid adenocarcinoma, invasive carcinoma in cervix",,"Grade I-II for endometrial adenocarcinoma, not graded for cervical carcinoma",Malignant,,,

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
1) Received in fixative, labeled with the patient' s name and unit number and ""uterus,
cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries"", is a 232 gram specimen including a previously
opened uterus (10.5 x 7.2 x 5.5 cm), left fallopian tube (5.' cm in length, 04-0.6 cm
in diameter), left ovary (2.5 x 2.2 x 1.1 cm), right fallopian tube (6.2 cm in length,
0.5-0.7 cm in diameter ), right ovary (3.1 x 2.2 x 1.4 cm). The external surface of
the uterus is dull and covered by multiple fine adhesions. There is an area (1.5 x
1.0 cm) in the lower pole of the left ovary which is ragged and probably represents a
resection margin (inked black). There is no visible gross lesion on the external
surface of the specimen . The cervix measures 2.2 x 2.0 cm and is covered by red-tan
slightly hemorrhagic smooth mucosa. The external os is slit-like and measures 0.4 x
0.2 cm. The endocervical canal is 2.7 cm in length and has pink-tan herringbone
mucosa . The endometrial cavity measures 5.5 cm in length x 3.7 cm from cornu to
cornu. There is anextensive exophytic papillary growth involving almost the entire
endometrium sparing only the lower uterine segment, 0.3 cm on the anterior surface and
1.1 cm from the posterior surface. The uninvolved endometrium has pink-tan appearance
and measures 0.2 to 0.4 cm in thickness. The tumor mass is white-tan, fragile and
papillary. The tumor measures 6.2 cm (combined on anterior and posterior surface) x
5.2 cm x 1.4 cm (maximum thickness). The central portion of the tumor is necrotic.
Grossly, the tumor invades myometrium with the maximum extent of the anterior uterine
wall, 1. 4 cm of muscle invasion with 2.8 cm wall thickness. There is a partially
calcified leiomyoma (4.5 cm in diameter) located within the myometrium of the
posterior wall with a focal area of hemorrhage. Both fallopian tubes have previously
removed central portions, consistent with a history of bilateral tubal ligation.
There is a paratubal cyst (0.4 cm in diameter) with smooth internal lining and filled
with yellow fluid, which is located in the distal portion of the right fallopian tube.
Otherwise, the fallopian tubes are unremarkable. The left ovary is composed of
sclerotic white-yellow tissue with multiple corpora albicantia. The right ovary has
smooth and glistening pink-tan surface with white-yellow sclerotic parenchyma and
multiple corpora albicantia. The specimen is serially sectioned and submitted as
follows:

forrnalin-filled specimen is markedly distorted but when examined fresh measured 15.0 x 13.0 x 11.0 cm. The serosal
surface is smooth. The cervix measures 2.1 x 2.0 cm. The ectocervix has a tan-brown, glistening mu.cdsa with nogross lesions seen ,The endocerrical canal has a tan appearance and measures 2.7 cm in length. The endometriel
cavity is difficult to measure secondary to marked distortion, but appears to. measure at least 9.0 'cm from
comu-to-comu by 6.5 cm in length. The ertdometrial cavity is filled by the previously described large polypoid mass
measuring 14.0 x 12.5 x 10.0 cm, The mass is multilobulated and muibcystic with abundant areas of green-tannecrosis and friable tan, solid areas .The mass appears to. originate :from the fundus and the superior aspect of the
anterior endometrium involving.the anterior myometrium. The remainder of the endometrial mucosa has arough,nodular appearance. The myometrium is thinned in multiple areas and has multiple nodules present within the anterioraspect which appear to be contiguous with the lesion. The largest of these nodules measure 3.0 cm in greatest
dimension. The nodules extend to within 0.3 cm. of the serosal surface which is smooth and glistening. The
myometrium measures up to 12 cm in greatest thickness. Multiple additional firm nodules are present in the posterioraspect of the myometriurn. These nodules have a well-circumscribed firm, tan-white, whorled appearance. The
largest of these nodules measure 0.6 cm in greatest dimension. The anterior myometrium is also involved by multiple
firm well-circumscribed, tan-white, whorled-appearing nodules with abundant calcification. The nodules measure up to
2.5 cm in greatest dimension. The right fallopian tube and ovary are still attached to the uterus. The right fallopian
tube measures 6.5 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm and has a fimbriated end. The tube is sectionedto show a pinpoint lumen with no
additional lesions seen .The right ovary is strophic and measures 1.6 x 0.8.x 0.6 cm. The serosal surface is tan-whiteand smooth The ovary is bisected to show a tan-white mottled parenchyma with no lesions seen .The left fallopiantube and ovary are detached and present in the container.
