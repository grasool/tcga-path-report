CLINICAL HISTORY:
Malignant neoplasm of corpus uteri
GROSS EXAMINATION:
A. ""Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries"", received fresh for frozen
section and placed in formalin on is a 157
cm hysterectomy specimen with attached right and left adnexagmr . 1The uterine 3 2
serosa is tan-pink to red-brown and focally hemorrhagic. The cervix is 3.5 x
2.7 cm. The entocervical mucosa is gray-white, the cervical os is patent up
to 1.2 cm. The endocervical canal is obliterated by a tan-yellow to red-brown
necrotic fungating tumor mass which is 4.5 x 4 cm overall. The tumor mass
involves both the anterior and posterior endocervical canal. A representative
section of the anterior endocervical canal is submitted for frozen section as
AF1, the frozen section remnant is submitted in block Al. The endometrial
cavity is lined by tan granular endometrium which is 0.3 to 0.4 cm thick. The
tumor is minimally involving the posterior lower aspect of the endometrial
cavity. The endometrial cavity at the fundus displays a 3 x 1.8 cm
pedunculated polyp. Sectioning through the tumor reveals a tan-yellow to
tan-gray gritty cut surface which is approximately 1.5 cm thick at the
thickest myometrial region of up to 2 cm. The right ovary is 3.5 x 1.2 x 1
cm. The external surface is remarkable for several red-brown to gray fibrous
adhesions. The associated fallopian tube segment is 5 cm in length x 0.4 cm
in diameter. The serosal surface is remarkable for several intact paratubal
cysts. The left adnexa is remarkable for an abundant amount of gray
periadnexal soft tissue 4.8 x 3.5 x 2 cm. There is a segment of fallopiantube whichis 9 cm in length x 0.3 cm in diameter. Sectioning of the
periadnexal soft tissue reveals no identifiable ovarian parenchyma.
Representative sections submitted in blocks Al-A17.

GROSS EXAMINATION:
A. ""Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries (AF1)"", re ved fresh for
frozen section and transferred to formalin at 4M on is a 1B6 gram,
9.8 x 9.2 x 5.2 cm uterus. The cervix is amputated and per surgeon was
macerated during surgery. The separate portion of cervix measures 3.5 x 2.6 x
1.9 cm and demonstrates a tan smooth ectocervix with a 1.3 cm os. The
endocervical canal is covered with a tan-yellowmucosa which focally appears
friable. The endometrial cavity is 6.5 (cornu to cornu) x 7.3 cm (to point of
cervical amputation) is filled with a 7.8 x 5.5 x 2.1 cm friable fungating
mass. The tumor primarily involves the anterior wall but extends over the
fundus partially onto the posterior wall to within 1.1 cm of the amputation
site of the cervix. The tumor is focally necrotic and invades 1.1 cm into a
1.6 cm myometrium. A representative section of the tumor is frozen as AF1
(remnant Al). The remaining endometrium is tan and approximately 1 mm in
thickness. The myometrium which is on average 2 cm thick is tan and partially
trabeculated with one intramural white whorled nodule, up to 0.7 cm,
consistent with leiomyoma. The serosal surface is tan and smooth with no
gross abnormalities identified.
The right fallopian tube, 8.5 cm long is distally dilated to 1.7 cm in
diameter. Proximally, the diameter is 0.4 cm. The surface of the right
fallopian tube demonstrates focal yellow discoloration and opening the tube
reveals a cystically dilated tube with yellow studding of the luminal
surface. The cystic dilated portion is filled with brown-red liquid. The
right ovary, 3.5 x 1.5 x 1 cm, is grossly unremarkable. The left fallopian
tube, 8 cm long x 0.5 cm in diameter, and left ovary, 2.5 x 1.1 x 0.8 cm, are
grossly unremarkable.

COMMENT:
A representative block of the endometrial tumor (C8) is
submitted for immunohistochemical evaluation, given the presence
of tumor in both the endometrium and ovaries. The tumor shows
only scant scattered weak positive staining for WT1 and is
positive for E-cadherin. The predominant tumor in the
endometrium and the absence of strong positive staining for WT1
supports classification as a tumor of primary endometrial
origin.

Gross Description
1. The specimen labeled with the patient's name and as ""Omentum: Omentum"". It consists of a
large unoriented segment of omentum, measuring 24.0 x 10.0 x 1.5 cm (weighing 103.2 g-fresh).
Cross-sections appear homogeneously yellow-tan and focally hemorrhagic. No distinct nodules
or tumors are grossly identified.
1A-1 E representative sections submitted
2. The specimen, labeled with the patient's name and as ""Uterus: Uterus, cervix, bilateral
salpingo-oophorectomy"". The specimen is received fresh and subsequently placed in 10%
buffered formalin. It consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral ovaries and fallopian
tubes; weighing 128.9 g (fresh). The body of the uterus is slightly distorted and measures 9.0 cm
SI x 5.5 cm ML x 5.2 cm AP. The serosal surface is pink-tan, focally hemorrhagic and smooth.
The cervix has a maximum diameter of 2.0 cm. The cervical Os measures 0.4 cm in maximum
diameter and has a ""slit-like"" shape. The uterus is bivalved. Both endo/myometrial layers are not
of uniform thickness. There is a large tumor occupying the entire endometrial cavity, measuring
8.7 cm SI x 4.5 cm ML x 5.0 cm AP. The tumor extends from the endometrial cavity to the lower uterine segment and towards the exocervix. Gross invasion into the myometrium is identified.
The cut surface of the tumor appears pale-tan, focally hemorrhagic and partially necrotic. The
distance from the tumor to the closest margins are as follows: 1.4 cm from the anterior exocervix,
0.9 cm from the posterior exocervix and <0.1 cm from the closest serosal surface (posterior
aspect). The cervical canal is patent and shows small amounts of mucoid material. The cervix
reveals a few Nabothian cysts, the largest measuring 0.2 cm in diameter. All of the Nabothian
cysts are filled with tan gelatinous material. The right ovary measures 2.0 x 1.1 x 0.9 cm. The
surface of the right ovary appears tan and slightly nodular. Cross sections show corpus albicans.
Within the right parovarian tissue, one poorly defined nodule is identified measuring 0.4 x 0.3 x
0.3 cm. The cut surface of the nodule appears homogeneously white, solid and firm. The right
fallopian tube measures 5.0 cm in length x 0.7 cm in diameter. The surface of the right fallopian
tube appears pink-tan and smooth, showing one para tubular cyst measuring 0.2 cm in maximum
dimension (filled with white milky fluid). Cross sections appear pale-tan and grossly
unremarkable. The left ovary measures 1.9 x 1.1 x 0.8 cm. The surface of the left ovary appears
tan and slightly nodular. Cross sections show corpus albicans. The left fallopian tube measures
5.5 cm in length x 0.6 cm in diameter. The surface of the left fallopian tube appears pink-tan and
smooth. Cross sections appear pale-tan and grossly unremarkable. Multiple sections from both
ovaries/ fallopian tubes, as well as two pieces of the endometrial tumor have been taken for
tissue banking. Representative sections are submitted as follows:
2A section of left ovary/fallopian tube, previously submitted by research PA
2B section of right ovary/fallopian tube, previously submitted by research PA

Ca.CcIncr- sere s , S

-LS-The endometrial cavity is diffusely involved by high-grade serous carcinoma with focaltointraepithelial carcinoma present at the surface of residual uninvolved atrophic
endometrium. The tumor at the uterine cavity represents the largest tumor bulk and it
invades into the outer half of the anterior myometrium but does not directly extend to
the uterine serosa; there is concurrent multifocal microscopic serosal tumor deposits
present on the anterior serosal surface (not in contiguity with the intrauterine
tumor). There is focal tumor involvement of the ovarian surface with associated
parenchymal tumor nodules in both ovaries. The lumen of the right distal fallopian
tube and fimbria is extensively involved and extended by multinodular tumor deposit.
While it is possible that the high-grade serous may have originated from the right
distal fallopian tube or alternatively that the tumors in the uterus and the right
fallopian tube represent synchronous primaries, the distribution of the disease is
most in keeping with a uterine primary that subsequently metastasized to the different
extra-uterine sites.This is also supported by the immunostaining findings that both the uterine tumor and the right tubal tumor show only weak focal nuclear WT1
immunoreactivity, in contrast to the usually strong and diffuse WT1 immunoreactivity
observed in the great majority of primary ovarian/tubal serous carcinomas.
Clinical History as Provided by Submitting Physician:
High-grade endometrial Ca on biopsy
Gross Description:
Received are four containers, each labelled with the patient's name, XXXXXXXXXXX and
demographics.
Container A is labelled RIGHT PELVIC LYMPH NODES and consists of multiple pieces of
fibrofatty tissue aggregating to 7 x 2.5 x 0.5 cm. Two lymph nodes are identified
within the fibrofatty tissue measuring 2 x 1.3 x 0.5 cm and 2 x 0.7 x 0.2 cm,
respectively and are submitted in toto in cassettes Al and A2. The remainder of the
fibrofatty tissue is submitted in cassettes A3 and A4.
Container B is labelled LEFT PELVIC LYMPH NODE and consists of multiple pieces of
fibrofatty tissue aggregating to 4.5 x 3 x 1 cm. Two lymph nodes are identified
within, one measuring 2 x 1 x 0.4 cm and the other measuring 1.9 x 0.8 x 0.4 cm. They
are sectioned and submitted in B1 and B2, respectively. The remainder of the
fibrofatty tissue is submitted in B3 and B4.
Container C is labelled UTERUS, CERVIX BILATERAL TUBES, AND OVARIES and consists of a
total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy specimen. The uterus measures
4.4 x 3.6 x 2.5 cm, left fallopian tube measures 5.6 x 0.5 cm, left ovary measures 2 x
1x 1.3 cm, right fallopian tube measuring 6 x 0.5 cm at its attachment site to the
uterus, dilating up to 1.5 cm at its fimbriated end, right ovary measuring 2 x 1 x 0.5
cm.
The serosal surface is tan-brown, smooth, shiny, and free of any adhesions. The
ectocervix measures 1.8 x 2.4 cm and it is covered by a glistening white mucosa. The
external os is slit-like and measures 0.7 cm. The endocervical canal measures 2.1 cm
and involved by a friable tumor in the proximal region. The same friable white
exophytic tumor is present, diffusely involving the endometrial cavity. On cute
sections, the tumor invades into the out half of the anterior myometrium (to within
0.3 cm of the serosal surface) but does not extend to the serosa.
Left fallopian tube is unremarkable. The left ovary is multinodular and cystic and
there are several golden areas which grossly resemble the appearance of corpora lutea.
The right fallopian tube has multiple nodules towards its fimbriated end, the largest
of which measures 1 cm in diameter. Cut sections through the nodules show a white,
soft mass with a central area of hemorrhage. These nodules appear to be mostly
contained within the lumen of the fallopian tube. There are also several cystic
spaces near the fimbriated end, the largest measuring 0.7 cm in diameter, filled with
a mucinous-like material. The right ovary is multinodular and golden in appearance,
and otherwise unremarkable. Representative sections are submitted as follows:
Cl-C2 -representative sections of left ovary
C3-C4 -representative sections of left fallopian tube
C5-C6 -right ovary submitted in toto
C7-C10 -Right fallopian tube mass, submitted in toto

identification, labeled ""anterior abdomen"" and consists of three
pieces of soft tan tissue measuring 1.6 x 1.0 x 0.4 cm in aggregate.
The specimen is entirely submitted in one cassette.
B. The specimen is received in formalin with proper patient
identification, labeled ""colic gutter is"" and consists of four pieces
of soft tan tissue measuring 0.9 x 0.8 x 0.3 cm in aggregate. The
specimen is entirely submitted in one cassette.
C. Specimen is received in formalin with proper patient
identification labeled ""omentum"" and consists of an omentectomy
specimen measuring 15 x 10 x 1.8 cm. The specimen is sectioned to
reveal unremarkable fibroadipose tissue. No nodules or mass lesions
are identified. The specimen is representatively submitted in fourssettes.
Specimen is received fresh with proper patient identification
labeled ""Uterus, cervix, tubes, and ovaries"". The specimen weighs
1990 grams and measures 19 x 17 x 16 cm. The external surface of the
uterus is distorted by multiple firm fibroid nodules. The ectocervix
measures 2.9 cm in diameter with 0.8 cm patent The ectocervical
mucosa is smooth, glistening and unremarkable. The endocervical canal
measures 3.5 cm in length and 0.4 cm in diameter with a smooth
glistening mucosa. The endometrial cavity measures 4.5 cm in length
and 2.9 cm in width. The cavity is distorted by multiple nodules.
There is a mass extending from the endometrium into the myometrial
wall. The tumor measures 3.5 x 3.0 x 3.0 cm (with 3.0 cm representing
depth from endometrial surface to tumor base). It is friable and has
a white-tan cut surface with hemorrhagic areas. It extends from the
anterior aspect of the endometrial cavity in the fundic/cornu region
to within 1.6 cm of the peritoneum over the anterior portion of the
uterus. The mass extends to within 2.1 cm of the anterior peritoneal
surface of the uterus Sectioning through the myometrium
reveals numerous tan-white whorled, well circumscribed nodules without
areas of hemorrhage, necrosis, or degeneration. The largest of these
nodules measures 10 cm in greatest dimension. The right fallopian
tube measures 7.2 x 0.6 cm with an unremarkable serosa and a pinpoint

B: Uterus, tubes and ovaries, hysterectomy with bilateral
salpingo-oophorectomy
Uterus and cervix, hysterectomy:
Location of tumor: anterior and posterior endometrium
Histologic type: high grade uterine papillary serous carcinoma
with associated calcifications
Histologic grade (FIGO): grade 3
Extent of invasion: involves uterus, cervix, and bilateral
adnexae
Myometrial invasion: outer half, extends to <1 mm from the
serosa in the uterine body and involves the serosa in the
posterior lower uterine segment
Lower uterine segment involvement: present
Cervical involvement: present; also, there is a small amount of
soft tissue attached to the posterior aspect of the cervix,
which is involved by microscopic foci of serous carcinoma
Adnexal involvement (see below): present

FIGO (2008 classification) Stage grouping:
These stages are based on information available at the time of
this report, and are subject to change pending additional
information and clinical review.
Ovary, right, oophorectomy:
- Involved by serous carcinoma
- Few tumor foci measuring up to 3 mm
- Surface involvement present
- Physiologic changes
Ovary, left, oophorectomy:
- Involved by metastatic serous carcinoma
- Few tumor foci measuring up to 5 mm
- Surface involvement present
- Physiologic changes
Fallopian tube, right, salpingectomy:
- Serous carcinoma involves serosal surface
- Detached fragments of carcinoma in tubal lumen, but no tubal
epithelial involvement
- Endosalpingiosis
- Fimbria with vascular congestion and lymphatic dilatation
Fallopian tube, left, salpingectomy:
- Serous carcinoma involves serosal surface
- Detached fragments of carcinoma in tubal lumen, but no tubal
epithelial involvement
- Paratubal tissue with benign ectopic adrenal cortex
Comment:This serous carcinoma is considered to be of endometrial origin
since morphology of tumor is the same in endometrium and
ovaries, endometrial tumor is large while ovarian is small, there is deep myometrial invasion and lymphovascular
space invasion, tumor involves bilateral ovaries, several small
foci are seen in each ovary, and there is ovarian surface
involvement as well as parenchymal involvement.
Immunohistochemical stain for CD31 supports both lymphovascular
space invasion and myometrial tumor with artifactual clearing
around invasive tumor foci.
Clinical History:
This is a -year-old female with endometrial cancer.
Gross Description:
Specimen A is received in one appropriately labeled container,
additionally labeled ""omentum"" and consist of one aggregate of
yellow fatty omentum weighing 310 grams and measuring 15 cm x 16
cm x 7 cm. Sectioning through this omentum reveals at least 3
large tumor nodules measuring 11.5 x 4.0 x 1.5 cm; 6.5 x 3.0
x 1.5 cm; and 5.5 x 2.3 x 1.5 cm. The cut surface of these
nodules is yellow and firm. Representative sections of tumor are
placed into blocks Al-A5. A representative section of uninvolved
omentum is placed into block A6.
Specimen B is received in one appropriately labeled container.
Adnexa: Present bilaterally
Weight: 300 grams
Shape: Pear shaped, with large subserosal irregular
nodularities. The largest of these is on the posterior surface
and measures 3.2 cm.
Dimensions:
height: 13.5 cm
anterior to posterior width: 5.8 cm
breadth at fundus: 7.0 cm
Serosa: Tan, smooth, nodule with 2-3 pedunculated white
whorled firm lesion (greatest dimension 2.3 cm)
Cervix:
length of endocervical canal: 4.5 cm
ectocervix: Tan, hemorrhagic
endocervix: Tan, rough, hemorrhagic
Endomyometrium:
length of endometrial cavity: 5.0 cm
width of endometrial cavity at fundus: 4.7 cm
tumor findings:
dimensions: 4.5 x 3.8 x 1.5 cm appearance: Fungating, irregular, tan/brown, friable
location and extent: Gross involvement by both the anterior
and posterior endometrium.
myometrial invasion: Inner one-half
thickness of myometrial wall at deepest gross invasion: 2.5 cm
other findings or comments: There are numerous (6-8) white
whorled nodules found in the myometrium. The largest of these
measures 2.4 cm x 2.5 cm x 3.2 cm.
Adnexa:
Right ovary:
dimensions: 4.0 cm x 1.1 cm x 1.7 cm
external surface: White, bosselated
cut surface: White/tan/yellow with one clear fluid filled cyst
measuring 0.6 cm without excrescences.
Right fallopian tube:
dimensions: 7.5 cm x 0.9 cm
other findings: This fallopian tube has been fragmented into
two pieces proximally. The lumen of the right fallopian tube is
white and firm.
Left ovary:

Grade: Not provided
Behavior: Malignant (invasive serous carcinoma found in the ovary and endometrium)

Justification: The patient was diagnosed with endometrial cancer, and the pathology report shows involvement of both ovaries and the endometrium by serous carcinoma. The stage is determined based on the AJCC Pathologic Stage provided (pT3a), but FIGO stage grouping is not explicitly given in the report. The grade is also not provided, so it cannot be determined. The behavior of this tumor is malignant due to its invasive nature and the involvement of multiple sites.",Serous carcinoma,pT3a (based on AJCC Pathologic Stage),,Malignant (invasive serous carcinoma found in the ovary and endometrium),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DIAGNOSIS:
A. Uterus, hysterectomy: FIGO grade 1 (of 3) endometrial
adenocarcinoma, endometrioid and villoglandular type, is
identified
forming a mass (2.5 x 2.0 x 0.7 cm), located in the
posterior
uterine wall. The tumor invades 0.6 cm into the
myometrium (total
wall thickness 1.8 cm). Lymphovascular space invasion is
not
identified. The tumor does not involve the endocervix.

Justification: The site is identified as the uterus based on the description of the specimen. The laterality is not provided, but it is not relevant in this case since a hysterectomy involves removing the entire uterus. The histology is given as endometrioid adenocarcinoma, which is a type of malignant tumor that arises from the endometrium. The stage is not explicitly provided, but based on the description of lymph node involvement, it may be at least stage II.

endometrial tumor is non-invasive ,while the ovarian tumor is primarily on the
surface. Given that the endometrium has the largest single deposit of
carcinoma (4.0 cm)compared with the small volume of tumor at the otherinvolved sites ,however, an endometrial primary is favored.
ADDENDUM 1:
The tumor is unreactive for Wilm's tumor gene (WT-1), which supports the
other pathology findings that the primary tumor is endometrial in origin.
See Hashi A et al, Wilms tumor gene immunoreactivity in primary serous
carcinomas of the fallopian tube ,ovary, endometriam ,and peritoneum.
I certify that I personally conducted the diagnostic evaluation of the abovespecimen (s) and have rendered the above diagnosis(es).

I certify that I personally conducted the diagnostic evaluation of the above
specimen(s) and have rendered the above diagnosis(es).
I"," Site: Endometrium, Ovary, Fallopian tube, Peritoneum

Justification: The largest single deposit of carcinoma is in the endometrium, but there are also tumors involving the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum. Therefore, it is not possible to determine a primary site with certainty, but an endometrial primary is favored based on the size of the tumor.

DIAGNOSIS:
A. Bladder peritoneum, biopsy: Metastatic adenocarcinoma
consistent
with endometrial primary.
B. Uterus, bilateral ovaries, and fallopian tubes;
hysterectomy and
bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy: FIGO grade III (of III)
endometrial adenocarcinoma, endometrioid_ pe, is
identified forming
a mass (6.6 x 6.1 x 5.5 cm) located in the fundus. The
tumor
invades 1.1 cm into the myometrium (total myometrial wall
thickness,
2.6 cm). Angiolymphatic invasion is present. The tumor
does not
involve the endocervix or cervix. The cervix is
unremarkable. The
left ovary is involved by metastatic endometrial
adenocarcinoma
forming a 6.2 x 3.7 x 2.5 cm mass. The right ovary is
involved by a
microscopic focus (0.3 cm) of metastatic endometrial
adenocarcinoma.
The right and left ovarian surface is uninvolved. The
right and
left fallopian tubes are without diagnostic abnormality.
C. Adnexal mass and portion of fallopian tube, right,

Comments
Sections of endometrium demonstrate a predominantly endometrioid
adenocarcinoma with focal clear cells and focal mucinous
differentiation .This Is graded as a moderate to poorly
differentiated, FIGO grade 2-3. Sections of cervix and right
parametrium show fragments of carcinoma outside of the plane of
sections of the tumor which are interpreted as ""floaters.""
The right ovary grossly was multi -cystic. Microscopically, a large
portion of the cyst demonstrate the lining epithelium to be
artifactually denuded . Focally, some residual lining epithelium is
present with focally some mucinous cells and in other areas columnar
epithelial cells. Focally , within the wall is some bone formation
as well as skin adnexal structures although no squamous epithelium
is identified . The overall histologic features are suggestive of a
mature cystic teratoma. No carcinoma is identified . Clinical
correlation and follow up is recommended.
At the request of the undersigned pathologist, these slides have
been additionally reviewed by Dr. IM who concurs with the
diagnosis.
This test has been finalized at the Campus.

COMMENT :The keratin positivity noted in the prior biopsy is entirely consistent with
leiomyosarcoma .Although some foci (A15) showed cells which resemble
rhabdomyoblasts ,MyoD1 is negative .No glandular component is identified in the
resection specimen and no keratin positivity is identified in a section stained from this
case ,which argue against a malignant mixed mullerian tumor .The findings were relayed

A. UTERUS, BILATERAL TUBES, OVARIES AND CERVIX
Labeled with the patient 's name ,labeled ""uterus, bilateral tubes ,ovaries and cervix "",received fresh for
intraoperative gross consultation, and subsequently fixed in formalin is a 190 gram total hysterectomy
and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy specimen. The uterus is about 7.5 x 6.0 x 6.0 cm. The cervical
portion of the uterus is 2.5 x 2.5 x 2.2 cm. The endometrial cavity is about 4.0 cm wide and about 4.0 cm
in length. The endometrial lining is 0.1 cm. The muscular uterine wall ranges from 1.2 to 2.0 cm in
maximum thickness. There are parametrial tissues attached to the uterus. Those on the right are about
2.5 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm and hose on the left are about 2.5 x 12 x 0.8 cm. The right ovary is. 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm.
A 1.3 x 0.7 x 02 cm portion of right ovary appears to have been previously removed for research
purposes. The right fallopian tube is 4.5 cm in length and 0.3-0.5 cm in diameter. The lumen is 0.1 cm.
The left ovary is 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm. The left fallopian tube is 4.5 cm in length and 0.4-0.6 cm in diameter.
The lumen is 0.1 cm.
There is a soft, tan, friable, hemorrhagic, pedunculated 5.5 x 5.0 x 3.5 cm endometrial tumor that largely
replaces the uterine fundus, corpus, and lower uterine segment. The tumor invades greater than 95% of
the myometrial wall in the lower uterine segment (grossly 2.0 cm into a 2.0 cm myometrial wall), The
tumor abuts the serosa of the anterior and posterior lower uterine segment but does not grossly extend
through the serosa. The tumor does not grossly extend into the ectocervix or parametrial soft tissues. A
1.0 x 0.7 x 0.3 cm nodule is present in the posterior endocervical wall, possibly representing tumor versus
post-fixation artifact. The endocervical canal is otherwise uninvolved by tumor. No metastatic tumor is
identified in the adnexa.

Behavior: Malignant (the patient was diagnosed with a malignancy, as evidenced by the involvement of multiple sites)

Justification: The patient was diagnosed with endometrial carcinoma in the uterus, which has extended to the cervix and lower uterine segment. There is also evidence of tumor involvement in both ovaries, fallopian tubes, and the omentum. Based on this information, the cancer is considered malignant, with a high grade and extensive spread throughout multiple sites. The lack of lymph node information prevents a more precise staging, but based on the depth of myometrial invasion, it has been classified as pT2Nx.",Mixed endometrioid and serous carcinoma,pT2Nx,Grade 3,"Malignant (the patient was diagnosed with a malignancy, as evidenced by the involvement of multiple sites)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Comment
Tumor demonstrated two architectural pattern with glandular and papillary structures merging
with solid sheets. The solid component occupies more than 50% of total. Focal squamous
differentiation is identified. Focally tumor cells show very high-grade nuclei and bizarre nuclear
morphology.
Immunohistochemistry staining shows glandular areas show positive staining with ER but weak
focal staining with p53 and negative staining with p16. The solid areas show negative staining
with ER but patchy positive staining with p53 and patchy positive staining with p16. The overall
morphological and immunohistochemistry features of this tumour is consistent with grade 3/3
endometrioid adenocarcinoma of endometrium.

FSA1: Uterus, hysterectomy
-Endometrial adenocarcinoma, deeply invasive into outer half of myometrium.
Frozen Section Pathologist:
Clinical History:
presents with abnormal appearing uterus at the time of hysterectomy.
Gross Description:
Received are five appropriately labeled containers.
Container A:
Comment :The uterus and bilateral tubes and ovaries are received partially morcellated and markedly disrupted. Therefore ,determining anterior from posterior is impossible .Determining grossly where the lower uterine segment is
located is also not possible .Of note ,only one of the ovaries and fallopian tubes is identified attached to the specimen.
The cervix and endocervical canal are received separately in the container.
Adnexa :One ovary is identified attached to its fallopian tube. A fragmented piece of separately discovered fallopian
tube is also appreciated .The second ovary is not discovered.
Weight :431 grams
Shape :cannot be determined due to morcellation
Dimensions :Because the specimen is morcellated ,the usual dimensions cannot be appreciated. The specimen measures
in aggregate 8.0 x 5 .0 x 5.0 cm.
Serosa :The serosal surface that can be appreciated is pink ,dull and significant for several subserosal candidate
leiomyomata (measuring less than 1.0 cm in maximum dimension).
Cervix :The separately submitted cervix demonstrates a white ectocervix with petechial hemorrhages.
length of endocervical canal: cannot be determined due to morcellations
endocervix: 4.0 cm
Endomyometrium:
length of endometrial cavity: estimated at 4.0 cm
width of endometrial cavity at fundus: 3.5 cm
tumor findings:
dimensions: The serially sectioned tumor that is appreciated measures 4.0 x 3 .0 x 1.0 cm.
appearance :The tumor is white ,soft, friable, and exophytic.
location and extent :The tumor is present in the uterine corpus that is appreciated. As stated ,extension to the lower
uterine segment cannot be appreciated.
myometrial invasion :outer half
thickness of myometrial wall at deepest gross invasion: 3.0 cm
other findings or comments: none
Adnexa: -
Undesignated ovary:
Dimensions :2.0 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm
external surface :smooth, tan and unremarkable
cut surface :demonstrates normal ovarian parenchyma with a corpora
albican
Undesignated Fallopian tube :The fallopian tube attached to the one identified ovary measures 4 x 0.5 cm. The external
surface demonstrates multiple paratubal cysts .There is one fimbriated end with a serpiginous architecture.
Other ovary: not identified
Other fallopian tube :A fragment of separate fallopian tube is identified
in the container measuring 3.0 x 0 .5 cm. There are multiple paratubal cysts. There is one fimbriated end and a
serpiginous architecture.

The serosal surface of the uterus Is tan-pink to purple and unremarkable. The ectocervix measures 3.0 x 2.8 cm. The cervical os Is silt-like, measuring 0.9 x 0.3 cm. The ectocervix is tan-pink and slightly hemorrhagic. Nabothian cysts are noted at the 8 to 8
o'clock position. The uterus and cervix have been previously opened. The endometrial cavity Is expanded by a tumormass. The endometrlal cavity measures 4.0 x 5.0 cm. The tumormeasures4.2 x 4.1 x 3.3 cm. The tumor Involvesboth the anterior and the posterior endometrium. It Is predominantly on the anterior endometrlum. The tumor is
tan-yellow to gray and polypoid. Seriallysectioning through the tumor reveals another area of significant myometrialinvasion, where the tumor appears to Invade Into the myometrium ate depth of 1.1 cm, where the entire myometrialwall thickness is 1.2 cm. A circumscribednodular massIs located within the myometrium of the anterior, lower, andmid-uterine segment. On cut surface, it has a white-pink, whorledtexture .It measures 1.5 x 0.9 x 1.3 cm. It most resembles a well circumscribedleiomyoma. The portion of myometrium not Involved by tumor measures 1.4 cm in
thickness. The remainder of the endometrium that does not appear to be Involved by tumor measures - 0.2 cm Inthickness. The tumor approaches the lower uterinesegment at the borderbetween the middle and lower uterine segment. It ties 1.7 cm from the endocervical canal. The endocervicalcanal measures 2.2 cm in length x 1.4 cm. Theendocervical mucosa Is tan-pink and contains some endocervlcal cysts. The right ovarymeasures 2.2 x 1.4 x 1.0 cm. The serosal surface Is tan-pink to yellow and unremarkable . The right fallopian tube measures 5.2 cm In length with an average diameterof 0.5 cm.

CLINICAL HISTORY:
Malignant neoplasm corpus uteri.
GROSS EXAMINATION:A. ""Uterus, bilateral tubes and ovaries"", received fresh and placed in
formalin on at pm is a markedly disrupted fragmented uterus with
attached bilateral adnexa, 235 grams overall. The cervix is received in
several fragments as well as several additional separate nodules consistent
with leiomyomata. The uterine corpus is 9.5 x 9.5 x 8.2 cm overall. The
endometrial cavity is remarkable for a tan, fungating, friable tumor mass
which is approximately 3.5 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm. Due to the fragmented appearance
of the uterus, anterior and posterior endometrial walls cannot be cut
ascertained. Sectioning through the tumormassreveals a tan-gray-white
surface. The tumormassis approximately 1.1 cm thick at its thickest
myometrial of up to 2.6 cm. The myometrium is tan, trabeculated, and is
remarkable for numerous leiomyomata, the largest of which is 6.5 cm in
greatest dimension. The cut surfaces of the leiomyomata are white, whorled,
no hemorrhage or necrosis is grossly noted. Additionally received in the same
container are two fragments of tissue compatible with disrupted cervix, the
cervix is 3.5 x 2.5 cm overall, the endocervical canal is unremarkable. Also
received are several well-circumscribed leiomyomata, the largest of which is 4
cm in greatest dimension. The cut surfaces are white, whorled, and no

posterior fundus. The myometrium underlying this area ranges up to 3.0 cm, The polypoid
lesion focally dips down into the myometrium for 0.5 cm involving approximately 20% of the
myometrium. The myometrium has numerous, intramural, submucosal and subserosal nodules, A
separate 1,2 cm polyp is identified on the posterior endometrium. The endometrium averages
0.1 to 0.2 cm in the normal appearing regions. The leiomyomata range up to 4.5 cm with the
largest leiomyoma being subserosal. No areas of hemorrhage, calcification or necrosis are
identified. The right fallopian tube is fimbriated and is 6.0 x 0,8 cm. The right ovary is
1.8 x 1.7 x 0.8 cm. The ovary has superficial adhesions, The ovary is bisected to have an
unremarkable yellow-tan to white, fibrous stroma. The left fallopian tube is fimbriated and
is 6.5 x 0.9 cm. The left ovary is 1,9 x 1.5 x 0.9 cm. The ovary is bisected to have a
dense, yellow-tan, fibrous stroma. Representative sections are sampled as labeled:

MOLECULAR RESULTS
Endometrial carcinoma, microsatellite instability testing:
Microsatellite-stable tumor (see technical report).
Intact (positive) nuclear expression of MI-H1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 by immunohistochemistry.
TECHNICAL REPORT
DNA extracted from microdissected paraffin-embedded tumor (T) in sections from block B5 and non-neoplastic tissue (N) from
block B16 was analyzed by a PCR-based method followed by capillary electrophoretic detection. A panel of seven microsatellite
markers recommended by the NCI (BAT25, BAT26, BAT40, D2S123, D5S346, D17S250 and TGFBR2) was evaluated to detect
changes in the number of microsatellite repeats in tumor as compared to normal tissue. No allelic shift was detected in the tested
microsatellite markers.
Immunohistochemistry for MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 was performed using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of
the endometrial carcinoma.
""This test was developed and its performance determined byencleared or approved by the U .S. Food and Drug Administration .The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. This test is used fo

F. UTERUS AND CERVIX
Labeled with the patient 's name ,labeled ""uterus and cervix "",and received fresh in the Operating Room for
intraoperative gross consultation and subsequently fixed in formalin and is a 270 gram total hysterectomy specimen.
The uterus is about 10.0 x 9.5 x 8.5 cm in greatest overall dimensions with the cervical portion measuring about 3.5
cm in length and up to 2.5 cm in diameter .The external cervical os is patent and 0.5 cm in diameter. The
endometrial cavity is 6.0 cm long and up to 5.0 cm in width. The muscular uterine wall has a maximum thickness
of about 2.5 cm.
The endometrial cavity is partially replaced by friable pink -tan tumor . The tumor measures about 13.0 x 9.0 cm in
area,involves the uterine fundus, the entire anterior and posterior corpus and the posterior lower uterine segment.
In the latter area the tumor extends very close to the endocervical /lower uterine segment junction .No gross tumor
is seen in the cervix .Cut sections of the uterus reveal invasion of greater than 50% of the uterine wall. Invasive
tumor extends to within about 0.3 cm of the serosal surface of the uterus .No involvement of uterine serosa or
parametrial tissues by tumor is evidence.
There is scant uninvolved endometrial mucosa in the anterior lower uterine corpus and lower uterine segment,
which measures about 0.1 cm in thickness .Within the uterus ,there are seven well-circumscribed leiomyomas,
ranging from about 0.5 to 2.5 cm in maximum dimensions ,three of which are subserosal and the remainder of
which are intramural .One of the intramural leiomyomas is located in the anterior lower uterine corpus and lower
uterine segment .One of the smaller leiomyomas has a semi-firm white rubbery cut surface. The other leiomyomas
have firm solid tan -white whorled cut surfaces .No areas of hemorrhage or necrosis are evident in any of the
leiomyomas .A focus of friable tumor measuring about 0.5 cm in diameter is present in the largest leiomyoma. The
mucosa of the cervix appears partly defective /eroded .Several mucus -filled cysts ,up to about 0.2 cm is diameter are
also noted in the cervix.

PATHOLOGY #:
Part F received fresh labeled 1 and ""uterus ,tubes ,and ovaries ""consists of a uterus with attached cervix and
left and right fallopian tube.
The uterus measures 8 cm superior to inferior ,7 cm laterally ,and 2 .5 cm anterior to posterior and weighs 160
grams .The left anterior serous has a 3 x 2.5 x 0 .3 cm irregular tan yellow irregular ulcerated mass attached to the left round
ligament and a 0.5 x 0 .4 x 0.3 cm nodule 0.8 cm inferior to mass.
The uterus is inked as follows :anterior -green, posterior -yellow, and the cervix is amputated and the uterus is
bisected into anterior and posterior halves revealing an irregular papillary mass primarily within the anterior endometrial
cavity measuring 2 x 2 cm. After inking, the cut sections ofthe mass on the serosal surface are tan-yellow. Cut sections of
the smaller tan nodule are well circumscribed and tan-white The myometrium measures 1.3 cm in maximal thickness and the
tumor is seen to invade to a thickness of 1.3 cm in the anterior endomyometrium. The myometrium in the posterior portion
measures 0.5 cm and the tumor is seen to invade to a thickness of 0.3 cm Cut sections of the remaining tnyometrium are
tan-pink and smooth .No other nodules are seen.
The cervical margin is irregular, disrupted and friable with multiple papillary areas .This area measures 5.5 x
5 cm. The amputated cervix is opened at the 12:00 position and sectioned clockwise and entirely submitted.
The left ovary measures 3 x 2 x 1 cm and weighs 3 grams. Cut sections of the left ovary are tan-pink with a central
tan-yellow area measuring t x 0.8 x 0.2 cm .The left fallopian tube is irregular and thickened and consists mainly of distal
fimbriated end measuring 3.5 x 03 cm.
. The right ovary measures2 x 2 x 0 .3 cm and weighs 2 grams. The right fallopian tube measures 4 x 0.5 cm Cut . .
sections of the right ovary are tan -pink . .
SUMMARY OF SECTIONS: FI and F2.- tumor with anterior endomyometrium; F3 and F4 - tumor with posterior
endomyometrium; F5 through F7 - irregular area on serosal surface; F8 - nodule on serosal surface; F9 - right ovary and
fallopian tube; F10 - left ovary and fallopian tube; F11 - right side of cervix; F12 - left side of cervix. The cervix is entirely
submitted as follows. F13 and F14 -1:00; F15 and F16 - 2:00; F17 - 3:00; F18 - 4:00; F19 - 5:00; F20 - 6:00; F21 and F22
- 7:00; F23 - 8:00; F24 and F25 - 10:00; F26 and F27 - 9:00; F28 - 11.00; F29 - 12:00.
MICROSCOPIC: A poorly differentiated papillary serous adenocarcinoma of the endometrium is seen infiltrating
throughout the myometruun and out onto the serosal surface. There is extensive vascular invasion. The neoplasm is also
seen to involve cervix including endoccrvical glands and cervical stromal invasion. The left ovary and fallopian tube are
also infiltrated by tumor as well as the left and right sides of the cervix. The tumor shows extensive necrosis, poorly formed
glands and extensive single cell infiltration. Lymphovascular space involvement is seen throughout the sections.

SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT
Page 3 of 4"," Site: Uterus, left ovary, left fallopian tube, and cervix
Justification: The report describes a papillary serous adenocarcinoma primary in the endometrium, which has invaded the myometrium, serosal surface, and cervix, as well as the left ovary and fallopian tube.

Laterality: Left
Justification: The tumor is present in the left ovary, left fallopian tube, and left iliac and obturator lymph nodes.

Histology: Papillary serous adenocarcinoma
Justification: This is stated explicitly in the report as the diagnosed tumor type.

Stage: Not provided
Justification: The report does not provide enough information to determine the stage of the cancer, such as whether there is evidence of metastasis beyond the pelvis.

Grade: FIGO grade 3
Justification: The report describes the tumor as poorly differentiated and having extensive necrosis, which are features consistent with a high-grade tumor.

Behavior: Malignant
Justification: This is indicated by the diagnosis of papillary serous adenocarcinoma, which is an aggressive type of cancer that can invade surrounding tissues and metastasize to distant sites.",Papillary serous adenocarcinoma,,FIGO grade 3,Malignant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Comments
Histologic sections from the endometrial neoplasm demonstrate a
tumor comprised of large epithelial cells with marked pleomorphism
and prominent nuclear atypia. In areas there is glanular and
pseudo-glandular growth as noted ;however ,much of the neoplasm is
composed of sheet-like growth of these neoplastic cells with no
discernible glandular formation .The overall histologic
characteristics are those of a poorly differentiated (grade 3)
endometrial adenocarcinoma. Clinical correlation is recommended. At the request of the undersigned pathologist ,these slides have
been additionally reviewed by Dr .- who concurs with the
diagnosis.

Labeled with the pateen s name, designated ""uterus, cervix"",
received fresh in the Operating Room for intraoperative gross
consultation and subsequently fixed in formalin is an 84 gram total
hysterectomy specimen. The uterus measures about 7.4 cm from the
fundus to the ectocervix, 3.8 cm from cornu to cornu, and up to 4.1
cm from the anterior surface to the posterior surface. The uterine
serosa is tan-red, and generally smooth except for procedure-related
artifact. Attached to the uterus, there is a small amount of pink-
tan firm parametrial soft tissue. The parametrial soft tissues,
bilaterally, appears grossly free of tumor. The cervix is about 2.8
cm long and has a maximum diameter of 1.9 cm in the ectocervical
region. The mucosa lining the ectocervix is tan and smooth. The
external cervical os is patent and about 0.9 cm in diameter. The
uterus was previously incised on both sides at the time of the
intraoperative consult. The cervical transformation zone is
distinct. The endocervical canal is about 2.1 cm long and lined forPage 2 of 6 Page 3 of 6
(coythe most part by slightly rugose tan mucosa. In the posterior
endocervix, there are two tiny endocervical polyps, measuring about
0.2 and 0.3 cm in maximum dimension, each is composed of semi-soft
tan-white tissue. Cut sections of the cervix reveal multiple mucus-
filled cysts ranging from about 0.1 to 0.3 cm in diameter. The
cervix appears grossly free of tumor. The endometrial cavity is
about 5.0 cm long and up to 3.0 cm in diameter. The endometrial
cavity is largely occupied by an exophytic polypoid pale tan tumor
mass that has a friable and focally papillated surface. The tumor
mass measures about 4.2 x 3.0 cm in surface area and has a maximum
thickness of about 1.6 cm, including exophytic and endophytic
components. extensively involves the uterine fundus, anterior
uterine corpus, posterior uterine corpus, and extends into the
posterior lower uterine segment. Upon sectioning the uterus,
invasive carcinoma is seen involving the fundus, posterior uterine
corpus and anterior uterine corpus. In the posterior fundus
and posterior corpus, greater than 50% of the wall thickness is
involved by tumor. Tumor in the anterior uterus and in the posterior
lower uterine segment is more superficially invasive (involves less
than 50% of the wall thickness). Within the uterus, mostly in the
lower anterior corpus and lower uterine segment, there is a small
amount of uninvolved tan endometrium that has a maximum thickness of
less than 0.1 cm. Within the uterus, there are five sharply
circumscribed intramural leiomyomas that measure about 0.3, 0.5,
0.6, 1.2 and 1.5 cm in maximum dimensions. The smallest and second
smallest leiomyomas are in the fundus. The third smallest
leiomyoma is located in the anterior lower uterine segment. The
largest and second largest leiomyomas are located in the posterior
uterine corpus. The largest and second largest leiomyomas have firm
white cut surfaces without grossly evident areas of hemorrhage
or necrosis. The second largest leiomyoma is partially calcified.
The smallest and second smallest leiomyomas have firm tan-white
whorled cut surfaces without grossly evident areas of hemorrhage or
necrosis. The uninvolved myometrium is semi-firm, tan-pink, up
to 1.8 cm in thickness and shows trabeculations and focal minute
cystic spaces suggestive of adenomyosis.

Labeled with the patient's name, designated ""left adnexa"" and
received in formalin is a salpingo-oophorectomy specimen. The ovary
is atrophic, about 2.3 x 1.2 x 0.7 cm and has a yellow-tan undulated
serosal surface. Attached to the ovary, there is a thin-walled
translucent unilocular paraovarian cyst that contains clear pale
yellow fluid and measures about 0.4 cm in maximum dimension. Cut
surfaces of the ovary reveal abundant yellow-tan cortical stroma and
a few corpora albicantia, but no gross evidence of metastatic tumor.
The adjacent fallopian tube has fimbria at one end, is 8.1 cm long,
and ranges from 0.3 to 0.4 cm in diameter. The serosal surface of
the fallopian tube is pink-tan and smooth. The fallopian tube has a
patent lumen, up to 0.1 cm in diameter and appears grossly free of
metastatic tumor.

Gross Descrogt oon:A.Received fresh labeled with the patient's name and ""uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries"" is a 154 gram hysterectomy
specimen, measuring 10.5 x 6.2 x 4.2 cm. The specimen is opened to reveal a 4.5 x 3.2 cm fungating mass located
predominantly in the posterior endometrium. Within the anterior and posterior myometrium is a 5.2 x 5.1 x 5.0 cm circumscribed
tan-white whorled nodule, grossly consistent with a leiomyoma. This leiomyoma is compressing up against and displacing the
majority of the endometrium. The endometrial cavity measures 3.5 x 2.5 cm and the endocervical cavity measures 3.2 x 0.9 cm.
The uterus is serially sectioned to reveal an average endometrial thickness of 0.1 cm and an average myometrial thickness of 1.4
cm. Grossly, the mass is invading 0.3 cm into the myometrium. Representative sections of the uterus are submitted as follows:
Al 12:00 cervix.
A2 6:00 cervix.
A3 Anterior lower uterine segment.
A4 Posterior lower uterine segment
A5 Full thickness anterior wall.
A6 One full thickness section from the mass in the posterior wall.
A7-A8 One full thickness section of the mass from the posterior wall (bisected).
A9 One additional representative section of the mass from the posterior wall.
A10 A representative section from the leiomyoma.
Attached to the uterus is a 4.5 cm in length by 0.6 cm in diameter tan-pink fallopian tube that is serially sectioned to reveal an
unremarkable pinpoint lumen. Proximately there is 0.6 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm circular piece of plastic. Representative sections from the
right fallopian tube are submitted in cassette A11. Adjacent to the fallopian tube is a 2.6 x 2.1 x 1.2 cm smooth, tan-white ovary
that is bivalved to reveal a variegated tan-white cut surface. One-half of the ovary is submitted in cassette A12.
Also attached to the uterus is a 4.2 cm in length by 0.6 cm in diameter fimbriated left fallopian tube. The external surface is
smooth, tan-pink and unremarkable. The tube is serially sectioned to reveal an unremarkable pinpoint lumen. Representative
sections from the left fallopian tube are submitted in cassette A13. Adjacent to the left fallopian tube is a 2.1 x 1.8 x 0.6 cm
tan-white ovary that is bivalved to reveal a variegated tan-white cut surface. One-half is submitted in cassette A14.
B.Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and ""left pelvic lymph node"" is a 4.7 x 1.8 x 0.8 cm aggregate of
yellow tan adipose tissue. The specimen is palpated to reveal seven possible lymph nodes ranging in size from 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm
to 1.5 x 1.2 x 0.5 cm. The lymph nodes are submitted as follows:
131 Four possible lymph nodes.
B2 Two possible lymph nodes.
B3 One possible lymph node.
C.Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and ""right pelvic lymph nodes"" is a 3.2 x 2.5 x 0.5 cm aggregate of

tan-gray, smooth and glistening. The uterus is bivalved to reveal a 3.1 x 2.6
x 1.1 cm tan, sessile, firm mass with a friable surface overlying the
endometrium at the fundus and extending into anterior and posterior
endometrial cavities. The mass grossly appears to invade 0.2 cm into a 1.2 cmthick myometrium.The mass doesnot extend to the cervix (2.6 cm at closest
approach from the posterior half). The uninvolved endometrium is otherwise
tan, smooth and with multiple less than 0.1 cm cysts. The 0.1 cm thick
endometriam overlies a 1 cm in average thickness unremarkable myometrium. The
cervix (2.9 cm in diameter with a 1.1 cm patent os) has an unremarkable ecto
and endocervical mucosa. A representative of the mass is frozen as AF1. The
frozen section remnant is submitted in block Al.

Gross Description
A. Received in formalin labeled - uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries"" is a previously opened uterus and cervix
with attached right and left fallopian tubes and ovaries, 336.0 grams. The uterus is symmetrical in configuration, 11.0 cm in
length, 7.5 cm in broadest extent, and up to 5.5 cm anterior-posteriorly. The serosa is pink-tan, smooth and glistening. The
cervix with attached vaginal cuff is 4.0 x 4.0 x 4.0 cm, and appears grossly normal. A portion of the cervix has been removed
intraoperatively and submitted for cancer research. Cross sectioningreveals a thin pink, slightly hemorrhagic endometrium,
0.1 cm in greatest thickness. A portion of the endometrium has been removed intraoperatively and submitted for cancer
research. Situated along the posterior aspect of the endometrial canal is a friable, red-tan polypoid lesion, 3.5 x 3.5 cm
across. The cut surface of the tumor reveals it to be grossly confined to the endometrium. At this level, the myometrium is at
least 2.5 cm in thickness. There is an area of circumscribed nodularity in the uterine wall, grossly consistent with a lelomyoma
of 1.0 cm. The right and left fallopian tubes are unremarkable. The right and left ovaries are each approximately 2.0 x 1.5 x
1.0 cm, and appear grossly normal. A portion of each ovary has been removed intraoperatively and submitted for cancer
research. Representative sections, blocks Al-A13.

B. LEFT TUBE AND OVARY Labeled with patient 's name ,labeled ""left tube and ovary"", and received
fresh in the Operating Room and subsequently fixed in formalin ,is about a 21 .5 gram salpingo-
oophorectomy specimen . The ovary is about 5 .0 x 3.5 x 2 .0 cm. The adjacent fimbriated fallopian tube
is 3.5 cm long and ranges from 0 .5 to 0 .6 cm in diameter with a maximum luminal diameter of about
0.2 cm.
The ovary andfallopian tube appear grossly free of metastatic tumor.
The ovary isremarkable for about a 0.5 cm cystic lesion that is lined by white-tan tissue and
contains tan grumous material and a few strands of hair. The lesion is grossly consistent with a
teratoma . The ovaryis also remarkable for relatively abundant yellow -tan cortical stroma. Attached
to the fallopian tube ,there is a less than 0.2 cm diameter thin-walled translucent smooth-filled
paratubal cyst.The fallopian tube is otherwise grossly unremarkable.

C. UTERUS (FROZEN ) Labeled with patient 's name ,labeled ""uterus (frozen)"", and received fresh in the
Operating Room for intraoperative frozen section ,and subsequently fixed in formalin is about a 680
gram supracervical hysterectomy specimen .The uterus is about 13.0 x 12.0 x 8.0 cm in greatest
overall dimensions. The endometrial cavity is about 13 .0 cm long and up to 6.0 cm in diameter. The
endometrial mucosa has a maximum thickness of about 1.3 cm. The muscular uterine wall ranges
from about 2.5 to 3 .0 cm in thickness.
The endometrial cavityis largely occupied by a friable tan exophytic tumor that is about 12.0 x 5.0 cm
in area . The tumor involves the fundus ,anterior and posterior lower uterine corpus ,and lower uterine
segments .The surface of the tumor is focallynecrotic. Cut sections reveal induration of the inner
third of themyometrium consistent with myometrial invasion by tumor. The tumor extends to the
surgical margin of resection of the specimen.
SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT No other gross pathologic lesions of the endometrium are seen.The myometrium shows
trabeculations and a few minute cystic spaces suggestive of adenomyosis.There is also a 0.5 cm
diameter fairly well delineated tan tumor nodule in the subserosal region of the uterus. No areas of
hemorrhage or necrosis are seen in this nodule.

DIAGNOSIS:
A. Uterus, bilateral ovaries and fallopian tubes;
hysterectomy and
bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy: FIGO grade I (of III)
endometrial
adenocarcinoma1 endometrioid type, is identified forming a
mass (2.9
x 2.5 x 1.1 cm) located in the posterior and left lateral
wall of
the endometrial cavity. The tumor superficially invades
0.3 cm into
the myometrium (total myometrial thickness, 2.2 cm). The
lower
uterine segment is uninvolved by tumor. Lymphovascular
space
invasion is not identified. The margins are negative for
tumor.
The cervix is unremarkable. There are multiple (2)
intramural
leiomyomas (0.5 cm and 0.6 cm in greatest dimension) and a
single
subserosal leiomyoma (0.5 cm in greatest dimension) in the
myometrium. The bilateral ovaries and remnants of
fallopian tubes
are unremarkable.
With available surgical material, [AJCC (7th edition)
pT1bNX].
This final pathology report is based on the
gross/macroscopic
examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation
of the
specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent
sections are
reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive
changes
identified on permanent section review will be reflected
in a
revised report.

Uterine cancer:
-Histologic Type: Endometrioid andenocarcinoma
Tumor site: anterior ,posterior endometrium ,including lower uterine segment,
with extension to involve endocervix.
Histologic grade :FIGO grade 3 (architectural grade2 ,cytologic grade 3)
Pathologic staging (pTNM[FIGO]): pT2, pNO, pM n /a (AJCC/UICC TNM 7th edition)
Microscopic Description:
Sections demonstrate an invasive endometrioid adenocarcinoma compoased of
pleomorphic, atypical cells with increased nuclear: cytoplasmic ratio, prominent nucleoli
and a moderate amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm. Numerous mitotic features are
identified. Architecturally, the neoplasm contains foci with a solid growth pattern in >5%
of the tumor. The malignant glands appear crowded and demonstrate irregular
contours. Maximal depth of invasion is 1.1cm in total thickness of 1.8cm, best
appreciated on frozen section material. Endocervical stromal invasion is seen.
Parametrial tissue does not appear involved. The myometrium demonstrates multiple
vessels with atherosclerotic changes. Lymphatic invasion is seen with a D240
immunostain. Vascular invasion is not identified with a CD31 immunostain. The bilateral
ovaries and fallopian tubes are uninvolved by tumor and demonstrate atrophic features.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
1) Received in fixative, labeled with the patient' s name and unit number and ""uterus,
cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries"", is a 232 gram specimen including a previously
opened uterus (10.5 x 7.2 x 5.5 cm), left fallopian tube (5.' cm in length, 04-0.6 cm
in diameter), left ovary (2.5 x 2.2 x 1.1 cm), right fallopian tube (6.2 cm in length,
0.5-0.7 cm in diameter ), right ovary (3.1 x 2.2 x 1.4 cm). The external surface of
the uterus is dull and covered by multiple fine adhesions. There is an area (1.5 x
1.0 cm) in the lower pole of the left ovary which is ragged and probably represents a
resection margin (inked black). There is no visible gross lesion on the external
surface of the specimen . The cervix measures 2.2 x 2.0 cm and is covered by red-tan
slightly hemorrhagic smooth mucosa. The external os is slit-like and measures 0.4 x
0.2 cm. The endocervical canal is 2.7 cm in length and has pink-tan herringbone
mucosa . The endometrial cavity measures 5.5 cm in length x 3.7 cm from cornu to
cornu. There is anextensive exophytic papillary growth involving almost the entire
endometrium sparing only the lower uterine segment, 0.3 cm on the anterior surface and
1.1 cm from the posterior surface. The uninvolved endometrium has pink-tan appearance
and measures 0.2 to 0.4 cm in thickness. The tumor mass is white-tan, fragile and
papillary. The tumor measures 6.2 cm (combined on anterior and posterior surface) x
5.2 cm x 1.4 cm (maximum thickness). The central portion of the tumor is necrotic.
Grossly, the tumor invades myometrium with the maximum extent of the anterior uterine
wall, 1. 4 cm of muscle invasion with 2.8 cm wall thickness. There is a partially
calcified leiomyoma (4.5 cm in diameter) located within the myometrium of the
posterior wall with a focal area of hemorrhage. Both fallopian tubes have previously
removed central portions, consistent with a history of bilateral tubal ligation.
There is a paratubal cyst (0.4 cm in diameter) with smooth internal lining and filled
with yellow fluid, which is located in the distal portion of the right fallopian tube.
Otherwise, the fallopian tubes are unremarkable. The left ovary is composed of
sclerotic white-yellow tissue with multiple corpora albicantia. The right ovary has
smooth and glistening pink-tan surface with white-yellow sclerotic parenchyma and
multiple corpora albicantia. The specimen is serially sectioned and submitted as
follows:

marked as ""pelvic washing with 1000 units of Heparin .""It consists of approximately 25 cc of yellow
watery fluid .Two cytospins are obtained.
B. The specimen is received fresh in a single container, labeled with the patient's name and number, and
marked as ""uterus ,cervix, tubes and ovaries .""It consists of a hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-
oophorectomy specimen weighing .62 grams .The uterus measures 6.8 x 5 x 2.5 cm and is in continuity
with the right 2 .5 x 1.5 x 1 cm, and left, 3 x 1.3 x 1 cm ovaries ,and the fimbriated right and left fallopian
tubes, each 8 x 0.5 cm.
The entire anterior endometrial cavity is filled with a 3 x 2 cm tumor. The tumor is friable and protrudes
up to 1.6 cm above the flat.endornetrial surface. Detached aggregates of tumor are found within the
endocervical canal. Further,, there is no grossly apparent extension into mucosa or underlying
endocervical stroma. There is suggestion of minimal superficial invasion into underlying myometriurn
which measures 1.1 cm in thickness. The adnexa are grossly free of tumor. Solid fibrous nodules
measuring-up to 0.8 cm in largest diameter are found growing on both ovarian surfaces. Paratubal
cysts are present bilaterally.

Procedures/Addenda:
Addendum
Addendum
The following addendum is issued to report the results of
estrogen and progesterone receptor and p63 immunohistochemical
studies.
Results:
Estrogen receptor (Ventana, clone SP1):
Interpretation: Approximately 60-700 of tumor cells show
moderate (2+/3) nuclear immunoreactivity.
Progesterone receptor (Ventana, clone 1E2):
Interpretation: Approximately 5% of tumor cells show moderate
(2+/3) nuclear immunoreactivity.
p63: Tumor is negative (with a postive control slide).
Site: Endometrium
Performed on block: E10
Fixation: 10% neutral buffered formalin
Fixation time: Not specified.
Comment:
The lack of p63 staining in the confluent areas of tumor growth
supports interpretation as adenocarcinoma with extensive solid
pattern growth and supports classification as grade 3
endometrioid adenocarcinoma."," Site: Endometrium
Justification: The specimen is labeled as endometrial cancer and multiple blocks are taken from different parts of the endometrium.

Laterality: Not provided
Justification: The clinical history mentions that the patient has endometrial cancer but it does not specify if it is unilateral or bilateral.

Histology: Endometrioid adenocarcinoma
Justification: The immunohistochemical studies show that the tumor is negative for p63, which supports this classification.

Stage: Not provided
Justification: The information given does not include details about the extent of the cancer or if it has spread to other parts of the body.

Grade: Grade 3
Justification: The immunohistochemical studies show that the tumor is negative for p63, which supports this classification as grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma.

Behavior: Malignant
Justification: The patient was diagnosed with endometrial cancer and it is not specified if it has been completely removed or treated.",Endometrioid adenocarcinoma,,Grade 3,Malignant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A. ""Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries (AF1-2)"". Received fresh is a
99 gram uterus (9 x 6 x 3 cm ) with attached left ovary (1.9 x 1.8 x 0.8 cm),
left fimbriated fallopian tube (3.6 cm long x 0.4 cm in diameter, right ovary
(2.6 x 1.5 x 1.2 cm) and right fimbriated fallopian tube (3.2 cm long x 0.5 cm
in diameter). The endometrial cavity is 2.7 cm from cornu to cornu and
expands 4.8 cm and contains an ill-defined fundal soft gray-tan endometrialmass(1.3 x 1 x 0.7 cm) that slightly traces into the anterior and posterior
endometrium, 4.5 cm and 3.1 cm from the anterior and posterior lower uterinesegmentsrespectively. The mass penetrates 0.2 cm into a 1.5 cm thick
trabeculated myometrium that contains a single white whorled intramural nodule(1 x 1 x 0.9 cm).The mass waspartially frozen as representative AF1. Theremainder of the endometrium is red-tan and diffuselycoarse (0.1 cm thick)with a second soft gray-tan mass (1.6 x 1.3 x 0.2 cm) that is 1.1 cm from the
lower uterine segment. Thesecond massextends 0.2 cm into the underlyingmyometrium. The uterineserosa ispink-tan, smooth and glistening. The
exocervix is red-white and smooth with diffuse erythema surrounding a 1 cm
cervical-os-that- leads--into- a-2.-5--cm`trahecu7.afed endocervical canal. The
left and right ovary are grossly unremarkable. The left and right fimbriated
fallopian tubes are both discontinuous and grossly unremarkable.

CLINICAL HISTORY:
Malignant neoplasm corpus uteri. Grade 1 endometrial cancer per endometrial
biopsy.
GROSS EXAMINATION:
A. ""Uterus, cervix, tubes, ovaries and fibroid (AF1-4)"", received fresh and
placed in formalin at is a 303 gram, 13 x 10 x 4.5 cm
didelphic uterus with attached bilateral tubes and ovaries (bilateral ovaries-
2.5 x 1.7 x 1.4 cm, bilateral fimbriated fallopian tube- 6 cm long x 0.6 cm in
diameter). The 3 cm in diameter cervix has one 1.5 cm in diameter patent os
which leads into a septated endocervical canal, dividing the endocervical
canal and endometrial cavities into right and left separate structures. The 7
x 4 cm left endometrial cavity is 100% effaced and replaced by white-tan,
exophytic, soft and triable endometrial tumor (present on both anterior and
posterior endometrium), which grossly invades 1.5 cm into and up to 3.5 cm
thick myometrium. The tumor also extends to involve the left anterior and
posterior lower uterine segment, 3.8 and 2.9 cm from the external os,
respectively. The 7 x 1.4 cm right endometrial cavity is compressed and
distorted by the aforementioned tumor in the left endometrial cavity as well
as by a large intramural nodule underlying the left endometrial cavity. The
right endometrium is 0.1 cm thick and contains two small, superficial tan
polyps, each 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.7 cm. These polyps are within the posterior right
endometrium.
There are three total myometrial nodules ranging from 1.5 cm in greatest
dimension -4 x 3.5 x 3 cm . All three nodules are intramural without
hemorrhage or necrosis , with the two smallest within the anterior, right
myometrium and the largest within the posterior, left myometrium.
The bilateral ovaries are pink-yellow with a 0.4 cm in diameter simple
cortical cyst within the left ovary with smooth inner walls. The bilateral
fallopian tubes are also unremarkable.
Also received is a separate 92 gram (fixed weight), 7.6 x 5.5 x 5.4 cm
white-tan, smooth nodule which on sectioning is focally calcified with an
otherwise whorled cut surface without hemorrhage or necrosis.

D. Portion of omentum, excision:
1.Negative for carcinoma.
Comment:
Within the endometrium, there is a FIGO III endometrioid adenocarcinoma
that invades into the underlying myometrium to closely approach the serosa.
Tumor however, is not identified on the serosal surface. Metastases are noted
in the right ovary, periappendiceal fat (at the tip), and within the mesenteric
fat of the small bowel. The metastases seen in the small bowel mesentery and
ovary show somewhat divergent (higher grade) histology than the primary
endometrioid adenocarcinoma. The pattern of infiltration as well as the
cytology raised the possibility of a synchronous neuroendocrine carcinoma. As a
result, immunohistochemical stains for cytokeratin 7, cytokeratin 20,
chromogranin, and synaptophysin were performed on both the endometrium and
ovarian tumor (B3 and B 13). The staining profiles are identical and consistent
with a metastatic endometrioid adenocarcinoma. Neuroendocrine differentiation
is not seen by immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemistry for estrogen and
progesterone has been performed on (B3) and (B 13) and will be reported
separately. has been called with the results on

Received in normal saline labeled , and ""uterus ,cervix,tubes ,ovaries ""is a 395 gram uterus including cervix and bilateral attached
adnexa. The uterus measures 9.2 cm from cervix to fundus ,4.5 cm from cornu tocornu ,and 3.2 cm from anterior to posterior .The serosal surface of the uterusis smooth ,shiny, and unremarkable without grossly apparent nodules or masses.
The right ovary is entirely replaced by a tan-yellow ,partially necrotic and
hemorrhagic mass that measures 8.5 x 6.5 x 5.5 cm. The mass appears to grossly
obliterate the fallopian tube. However ,there is a focal ,1.5 x 1.3 x 1.0 cm
portion of what appears to be fimbriated end adherent to the mass .In addition,immediately adjacent to the right cornu is a 3 .5 cm in length by 1.0 cm indiameter ,distended and dilated tubular structure with a smooth ,shiny serosalsurface that may represent residual fallopian tube .The left ovary (2.0 x 1.2 x
0.6 cm) is smooth and shiny and has a cerebriform surface within grossly evident
nodules or masses .Sectioning this ovary reveals a white to yellow, homogenous
cut surface ,again without masses. The left fallopian tube measures 5.0 cm in
length by 0 .6 cm in diameter and has a smooth ,shiny ,unremarkable serosawithout grossly apparent nodules or masses .There is a 0.2 cm ,white, shiny
paratubal cyst identified adjacent to the fimbriated end. Bivalving the uterus
into anterior and posterior halves reveals a thin, somewhat atrophic endometrium
with abundant overlying hemorrhage .The endometrium measures approximately 0.1
cm in greatest thickness and contains no grossly apparent nodules or masses.
The myometrium is light tan ,trabeculated, and contains two white, whorled
nodules measuring 0.7 cm in greatest diameter and 2.0 cm in greatest diameter.
The myometrium measures 1.8 cm in greatest thickness. The right ovarian mass,
while adherent to the right cornu of the uterus, does not grossly invade into
the uterus and does not involve the serosa .A representative section of the
right adnexal mass is submitted for frozen section analysis with the

Upon clinician, this case was reviewed and additional immunohistochemical staining was performed on blocks 81, B2 and 07.
The fallopian tube shows focal positivity for p53 and MIBI. with features consistent with serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma. There are also foci positive
for p53 and MIBI on the ovarian surface (block 82). These areas have features consistent with tubal intraepithelial carcinoma, as apposed to p53
signature or a tubal in transition lesion. The endometrial cancer, as shown in block 07, is strongly positive for p53 and negative for WT-1, consistent with
a serous carcinoma, high-grade of endometrial origin.
I would recommend the patient be treated according to these findings.

Laterality: The sample includes tissue from both sides of the body, including the right and left pelvic and aortic areas.

Histology: The histological examination revealed tumor growth in the uterus and cervix, with early myometrial invasion. Seven lymph nodes from the right pelvic and aortic areas were negative for metastasis.

Stage: The stage of the cancer is not provided in the report.

Grade: The grade or differentiation level of the tumor is not provided in the report.

Behavior: The behavior of the tumor is described as malignant, with early myometrial invasion and negative lymph nodes.

Microscopic Description
A-G. The microscopic findings support the above diagnoses.
A"," Site: Uterus
Laterality: Not provided (as it's a report on multiple specimens)
Histology: Adenocarcinoma, endometrioid type
Stage: T2b, NX (based on the information provided, the N category is not clear)
Grade: Not provided
Behavior: Malignant (due to the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma)

Justification: The report mentions a ""diffuse spreading mass lesion that covers the entire endometrial surface"" and ""the tumor extends inferiorly to involve the endocervical canal,"" which are indicative of malignant adenocarcinoma. The T category is determined based on the size of the tumor, and NX is used when lymph node involvement is not assessed or not reported.","Adenocarcinoma, endometrioid type","T2b, NX",,Malignant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GROSS DESCRIPTION
A. Part A received fresh, labeled ""uterus, cervix,
bilateral tubes and ovaries"", is a 100 gram, 5.5 x 5.5 x
4.0 cm. symmetrical uterine corpus with attached 1.4 cm. of lower
uterine segment and bilateral adnexa. The cervical tissue is not
present. The 5.0 x 3.9 cm. uterine cavity contains abundant soft
tan white-red tumor, both anteriorly and posteriorly. A scant
amount of uninvolved endometrium is present posteriorly, which
appears smooth tan pink and averages 0.15 cm. in thickness.
Anteriorly, the tumor spans an area of 5.4 x 4.2 cm. and
posteriorly, the tumor spans an area of 4.2 x 3.8 cm. On
sectioning, the tumor has a maximal thickness of 1.8 cm., grossly
involving up to 50% of the myometrium. The myometrium is tan pink
and measures up to 1.8 cm. in thickness, with a single, posterior
1.4 cm. well circumscribed rubbery whorled tan white intramural
leiomyoma. The right ovary is cystic and focally disrupted,
measuring 6.0 x 4.0 x 0.3 cm. The cyst is vacant with a smooth tan
white inner lining. The left ovary is cerebriform, pale tan gold
and measures 1.6 x 1.1 x 0.9 cm. On sectioning, the stroma is pale
tan with identifiable corpora albicantia. Bilaterally, the
fimbriated tan pink right and left fallopian tube segments average

- Metastatic serous adenocarcinoma involving 2 lymph nodes (2/2). Size of largest metastasis up to 2.5 cm, with
extracapsular extension. Comment:
Histologic sections of the above specimens show extensive involvement by serous adenocarcinoma of primary uterine
corpus origin. A uterine corpus primary is supported by involvement of the uterine corpus with transmural myometrial
invasion to the serosa with extensive lymphovascular space invasion. The involvement of the ovaries is multinodular
with preserved intervening areas of ovarian tissue ,also supporting metastases to the ovaries. Additionally,
representative sections from the endometrial tumor and the left ovarian tumor were evaluated by
immunohistochemistry. The tumor at both sites is diffusely positive for P53 and negative for WT-1, results that support
serous adenocarcinoma of primary uterine rather than ovarian origin.

CLINICAL HISTORY:
55 year old woman with a stage I endometrial carcinoma.
GROSS EXAMINATION:
A..-""Uterus"". A uterus measuring 9.5 x 4.0 cm and bilateral 2 cm fragments of
fallopian tubes. The uterus is grossly distorted by multiple leiomyoma
ranging from 1 to 3 cm in diameter. The uterus is opened anteriorly in the
midline revealing an exophytic mass measuring 5 x 3 x 1 cm with numerous
papillary projections into the endometrial cavity, involving anterior and
posterior endometrium and extending very close if not into the upper portion
of the endocervical canal. The endocervical canal measures 3 cm in length.
The myometrium is 1.5 cm thick. Grossly, the endometrial tumor appears to
involve the superficial.myometrium. The resection margin is inked in black
and multiple representative sections are taken.
BLOCK SUMMARY:
Al remnants of Afl, consisting of a.2 x 1 x 0.3 cm soft tan tissue and
multiple 2-3 mm fragments.
A2 remnant of Af2 consisting of tan soft tissue fragments measuring 1 x 0.5 x
0.2 cm.
A3 anterior endocervical canal, and the left fallopian tube.
A4 posterior endocervical canal, and right fallopian tube.
A5 anterior corpus and endocervix.
A6 anterior corpus including a leiomyoma.
A7 posterior corpus.
AS posterior corpus and endocervical canal.
A9 1 cm leiomyoma.
B. ""Left tube and ovary"". A 5 cm segment of fallopian tube, an ovary
measuring 3 x 1.5-x 0.1 cm, and a cyst measuring 2â€¢x1.5 x 1 cm that is
attached to the inferior portion of the ovary. The fallopian tube is 0.5 cm
in diameter and appears unremarkable. The ovary is yellow-tan with lobulated
surface. No focal lesions are present. The cyst attached to the ovary is
unilocular, contains a small amount of serous fluid. The wall is thin and
translucent.

fibroconnective tissue biopsy. The specimen is trisected and entirely submitted in
cassette B1.
C.Received fresh for tissue banking is a 50 gram, 5.0 x 4.8 x 3.6 cm uterine corpus which
has a separately received, disrupted 11 gram, 2.8 x 2.5 x 2.5 cm cervix. The cervix has an
eccentric 0.4 cm os. The uterus is received with the attached bilateral fallopian tubes
and ovaries and weighed with the tubes and ovaries removed. The cervix cannot be oriented
anterior to posterior, and the ectocervical rim will be inked blue with the deeper tissues
inked black. The uterine serosa has focal hemorrhagic adhesions and subserosal nodularity.
The uterus is bivalved to have a diffusely ragged, friable endometrium. The friable.
ragged endometrium appears to fill the entire cavity and is cauterized near the roughened
removed area of the previously amputated cervix. The ragged tumor-like area is 4.5 x 4 0
cm.Sectioning the myometrium shows a 1.8 cm possibly posterior, calcified leiomyoma
within the myometrium. The myometrium ranges up to 2.2 cm in this region, and there
appears to he possible invasive tumor extending 1 6 cm. The tumor is sampled for tissue
banking at The tumor grossly appears to involve more than 50% of the
myometrium posteriorly. and the myometrium is disrupted and hemorrhagic on the anterior
surface. The anterior myometrium averages 0.8 cm in thickness. The tumor appears to
extend with 0.2 cm between the tumor and inked serosa. The tumor diffusely extends more
than 50% of the myometrium both anterior and posterior The right fallopian tube is
disrupted and is 1.7 x 0.4 cm. The fimbria cannot be clearly identified. The right
ovary is 2.5 x 2.0 x 1.2 cm. The ovary is sectioned to have a dense fibrous stroma with
multiple corpora albicantia. The left fallopian tube is a 1.5 cm ill-defined hemorrhagic
segment of fallopian tube which is adhesed to a 2.5 x 1.2 x 1.2 cm ovary. The ovary is
sectioned to have a dense fibrous stroma with multiple corpora albicantia. Representative
sections are sampled as labeled:
C1-C3 -representative sections of cervix to include full cross section to
amputation site
C4 -one full thickness cross section of posterior lower uterine segment,
endometrium to serosa and a section of posterior fundic serosa with
subserosa nodules
C5-C7 -additional posterior full thickness cross section of endometrial tumor
to inked serosa
C8-C11 -anterior full thickness cross sections of endometrium, myometrium and

D.Received in formalin labeled ""posterior cul-de-sac"" are two hemorrhagic fibroconnective
tissue biopsies. The biopsies are 0.6 and 1.4 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm. The larger biopsy is
bisected, and the tissues are entirely submitted in cassette D1.
E.Received in formalin labeled ""pericolic gutter"" is a 1.4 x 0.7 x 0 4 cm nodular
fibroconnective tissue biopsy. The biopsy is bisected and entirely submitted in cassette

external :.^ is 1.2 x 0.2 cm, The endocervical canal is 3.5 cm in length with aherringbone appearance
, There is a 6.0 x 3.5 x 1.4 cm pink to tan friable mass on the
anterior wall of the uterus. The cut surface shows tumor invading into the inner half
of the myometrium. There is a 5.5 x 5.0 x 4.5 cm intramural fibroid in the posterior
wall of the uterus. The cut surface of the fibroid is white to tan with whorledappearance
. The tumor mass and fibroid distort the uterine cavity and the size of the
uterine cavity is unable to be determined. The endometrium overlying the fibroid
appears thin but is focally thickened to 0.2 cm. The myometrium is approximately 1.5

Addendum Comment
Section, designated B4, of the left obturator lymph node shows a nodular
architecture with several follicles some of which have small germinal
centers. Occasional follicles composed predominantly or entirely of small
lymphocytes some of which have a monocytoid appearance. Scattered, rare
plasma cells are noted. Areas of fatty infiltration are also identified.
Increased numbers of histiocytes are seen in the dilated sinuses. An
immunohistochemical panel was performed to further characterize the
lymphocytes with respect to architecture. B and T cells (CD20 and CD3
positive, respectively) show appropriate zonation. The T cells are also
positive for CD5 and CD43. No co-expression of CD20 and CD43 or CD5 is
appreciated. The small germinal centers are positive for CD20, CD 10 and
bcl-6, but negative for bcl-2. Some of the small follicles are positive for
CD20 and bcl-2, but negative for CD 10 and bcl-6, these follicles most likely
represent either mantle/marginal zone hyperplasia or primary follicles. CD21
and CD23 stains highlight the follicular dendritic meshwork in the
follicles. Cyclin D 1 is positive in the endothelial cells, but negative in
the lymphocytes.
The combined morphologic and immunophenotypic features in this lymph node
are most consistent with a reactive process. Clinical correlation and
follow-up is recommended.
intradepartmental consultation:
Hematopathology, have been consulted on this case and concur with the
findings and interpretation.

Comment
The tumor is predominantly composed of endometrioid adenocarcinoma with foci
of serous carcinoma. These foci are present at the lower uterine segment/
upper endocervical canal junction, and consititute the area of deepest
invasion. ER immunostain is strongly positive in the endometrioid areas,
while there is patchy staining in areas of serous carcinoma. P53 shows
strong and diffuse staining in endometrioid areas while it is negative in
areas of serous carcinoma.
Due to abnormal morphology of the lymph nodes, additional
immunohistochemical stains and hematopathology consult is pending, and the
results will be reported in an addendum.

GROSS EXAMINATION:
A. ""Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries (AF1)"", received fresh for)n is a 293 gram,
frozen section and placed in formalin at
13.5 x 8.5 x 5.5 cm total hysterectomy specimen with an attached 3.2 cm in
diameter cervix with a 0.6 cm patent os. The specimen is opened to reveal a
3.6 x 5.2 x 2.1 cm tan-white, soft, friable, fungating mass lesion located at
the uterine fundus. This mass lesion is located 3.2 cm to the anterior lower
uterine segment, and 2.8 cm to the closest posterior lower uterine segment.
(A4- anterior lower uterine segment, A5- posterior lower uterine segment). The
mass lesion is sectioned to reveal an apparent 0.8 cm invasion into to a 2.1
cm thick trabeculated myometrium. A section with the apparent deepest
invasion at the fundus is frozen as AF1 with the frozen section remnant
submitted in block Al. Sections of the anterior endomyometrium and posterior
endomyometrium with the aforementioned mass lesion are submitted in blocks
A6-7 respectively. The mass lesions comes to 1.5 cm to the closest serosal
surface. An additional representative section of the mass lesion is submitted
in block AS.
The remainder of the specimen demonstrates an endometrium of 0.1 cm overlying
a 2.1 cm trabeculated myometrium in the uninvolved uterus, within an
endometrial cavity of 6 x 5.1 cm. The uterus uninvolved by the aforementioned
mass lesion is remarkable for a 1.1 x 0.9 cm polypoid lesion in the posterior
lower uterine segment. The polypoid lesion is submitted in block A9. Also in
the posterior uterus are two white, whorled nodules, up to 1.8 cm in greatest
dimension. The smaller white, whorled nodule is submitted in block A7 with
the posterior endomyometrium. The larger white, whorled nodule submitted in
block A10. The cervix is sectioned to reveal a white-pink, firm, homogeneous
unremarkable cut surface. Representative sections of the cervix are submitted
in blocks A2-3 (A2- anterior, A3- posterior). The serosal surface is
pink-tan, smooth, glistening and grossly unremarkable.
Attached to the uterus are bilateral adnexa. The rightovarymeasures 3.8 x
1.5 x 0.8 cm in dimension, demonstrates a smooth unremarkable surface and is
sectioned to reveal a grossly unremarkable parenchyma. Adjacent to the right
ovary is a 9 cm in length x 0.6 cm in diameter fimbriated fallopian tube with
a 1 cm in greatest diameter serous filled paratubal cyst. Representative
sections of the unremarkable tube and ovary are submitted in block A13. The
left ovary is a 4.3 x 0.8 x 0.7 cm in dimension, demonstrates a smooth
unremarkable serosal surface and is sectioned to reveal an unremarkable cut
surface. The left fallopian tube is 6.2 cm in length x 0.6 cm in diameter and
is grossly unremarkable. Representative left tube and ovary are submitted in
block A14.

The diagnosis of Endometrioid Adenocarcinoma in the endometrium of the uterus was made based on the microscopic examination.

Laterality: Not provided
The laterality is not specified as the adenocarcinoma is diffuse and involves the entire uterus.

Histology: Endometrioid Adenocarcinoma
The diagnosis of Endometrioid Adenocarcinoma is based on the microscopic examination of the tissue specimen.

Stage: pT1b pN0 pMX
The pathologic stage was determined to be pT1b pN0 pMX, which indicates that the tumor has invaded up to 50% of the myometrium but has not extended beyond the uterus, and there is no evidence of cancer in the lymph nodes or distant metastasis.

Grade: FIGO Grade II
The FIGO grade of the adenocarcinoma is II, which indicates that the tumor has a moderate degree of differentiation with some solid areas but less than 50%.

Behavior: Malignant
The Endometrioid Adenocarcinoma is a malignant tumor, as evidenced by its ability to invade surrounding tissues and potentially metastasize.",Endometrioid Adenocarcinoma,pT1b pN0 pMX,FIGO Grade II,Malignant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Laterality: Not applicable
Histology: Endometrioid adenocarcinoma
Stage: pT1b (IB) - The tumor has invaded the inner half of the myometrium but has not reached the serosal surface or involved other organs.
Grade: G2 - Moderately differentiated
Behavior: Malignant - The tumor is aggressive and can invade surrounding tissues and metastasize to other parts of the body.

Justification: The uterus contained a tumor filling the endometrial cavity, confirmed as moderately differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma through microscopic examination. The tumor involved the entire endometrial cavity and invaded with a pushing front, making measurement of the exact depth of invasion difficult. However, it is estimated to be approximately 35% of the myometrium thickness, which translates to approximately 14 mm of invasion into a myometrium of approximately 40 mm in thickness. The regional lymph nodes were examined and found to be uninvolved by the tumor.

A. UTERUS, CERVIX, TUBES AND OVARIES
Labeled with the patient's name, labeled ""uterus, cervix, tubes and ovaries"", and received fresh in the
Operating Room for intraoperative frozen section, and subsequently fixed in formalin, is a 200 gram, total
hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy specimen. The uterus is about 9.5 x 6.5 x 6.5 cm in
greatest overall dimensions. The cervical portion of the uterus is about 2.5 cm in length and up to 2.7 cm
in diameter. The external cervical os is 0.3 cm in diameter. The endocervical canal is about 2.5 cm long
and up to 0.2 cm in width. The endometrial cavity is about 6 cm in length x 4.5 cm in diameter. The
muscular uterine wall is about 2.5 cm in maximum thickness. The endometrial mucosa ranges from
about 0.2 to 1.0 cm in thickness. The right ovary is 2.5 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm. The fimbriated right fallopian tube
is 6.5 cm long and up to 0.5 cm in diameter. The left ovary is 2.3 x 1.7 x 1.5 cm. The fimbriated left
fallopian tube is about 4.5 cm long and up to 0.6 cm in diameter.
The endometrial cavity is largely occupied by a soft tan friable exophytic focally papillated tumor that is
about 5.0 x 4.0 cm in area. The tumor replaces the endometrium of the anterior and posterior uterine
corpus and uterine fundus. Cut sections reveal induration of the underlying myometrium which appears
to be infiltrated by firm tan-white tumor. The grossly evident invasive tumor involves about 75% of the
uterine wall thickness. There is no serosal surface involvement or parametrial extension of tumor on
gross inspection of the specimen. The cervix appears grossly free of tumor. No metastatic tumor is seen
in the ovaries or fallopian tubes.
SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT
Page 3 of 5 There is a small amount of uninvolved endometrium in the lower uterine segment. No normal appearing
endometrium is seen in the uterine corpus or fundus. Within the uterus, there are also several tiny to
small circumscribed intramural leiomyomas ranging from about 0.2 to 0.3 cm in diameter. Each of the
leiomyomas is composed of firm solid tan tissue without grossly evident areas of hemorrhage or necrosis.
The cervix is remarkable only for a few mucus-filled cysts ranging from about 0.1 to 0.7 cm in diameter.
Both ovaries are atrophic. The left ovary shows relatively abundant yellow-tan cortical stroma which is
focally vaguely nodular. The left fallopian tube is grossly unremarkable. The right fallopian tube shows
mild segmental luminal dilatation with a maximum luminal diameter of about 0.6 cm.

Reviewer Initi"," Site: The primary tumor site is not explicitly provided, but based on the specimen description, it appears to be in the uterus (Part A).

Laterality: The laterality is not provided, but there are separate designations for left and right pelvic lymph nodes, suggesting that the cancer has spread, but the primary tumor is likely in the uterus.

Histology: The histology of the tumor is not explicitly stated, but based on the context, it appears to be a type of gynecological cancer, such as endometrial or cervical cancer (Part A).

Stage: The stage of the cancer is not provided, but the extensive sampling of lymph nodes suggests that it has spread beyond the primary site.

Grade: The grade of the tumor is not provided, which refers to how abnormal the cells look under a microscope and how quickly the tumor is likely to grow and spread.

Behavior: The behavior of the tumor is not explicitly stated, but it appears to be malignant based on the context (Part A).

Justification: These categories are inferred from the specimen description provided, which includes sampling of various lymph nodes, uterus, and other surrounding tissues.",endometrial or cervical cancer,advanced,,malignant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NO METHICILLIN RESISTANT STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS ISOLATED"," Site: Uterus, broad ligament, pelvic cavity (diaphragm scrapings), peritoneal washing
Laterality: Right, left
Histology: Endometrial papillary serous carcinoma, osseous metaplasia
Stage: Not provided (based on the information given, it is unclear which stage this cancer falls under)
Grade: Not provided (similar to stage, grade is not explicitly mentioned in the information given)
Behavior: Malignant (the presence of metastasis indicates an aggressive and harmful behavior)

Justification: The report mentions the presence of endometrial papillary serous carcinoma in the uterus, with metastasis to the broad ligament. Additionally, there are scrapings taken from both the right and left diaphragm, as well as a pelvic washing, which were all found negative for neoplasm. However, the absence of neoplasm in these areas does not exclude the possibility of metastasis or spread to these sites. Therefore, it is important to include them in the report. The stage and grade are not explicitly mentioned in the information provided, so they cannot be determined with certainty.","Endometrial papillary serous carcinoma, osseous metaplasia",,,Malignant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DIAGNOSIS:
Uterus, bilateral ovaries, and fallopian tubes;
hysterectomy and
bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy: FIGO grade 1 (of 3)
endometrial
adenocarcinoma, endometrioid type, is identified forming a
mass (2.8
x 1.5 x 0.9 cm), involving the fundus. The tumor invades
0.1 cm
into the myometrium (total wall thickness 2.0 cm). The
tumor does
not involve the endocervix. Lymphovascular space invasion
is not
identified. The margins are negative for tumor. There
are multiple
(2 subserosal, each 0.1 cm in greatest dimension; 5
intramural,
ranging in size from 0.4 cm to 0.7 cm in greatest
dimension)
leiomyomata in the myometrium. The bilateral ovaries and
fallopian
tubes are not involved. The fallopian tubes show mild
hydrosalpinx
(right, 2.8 x 1.5 x 1.3 cm; left, 2.2 x 1.2 x 1.2 cm).

ADDENDUM:
The endometrial cancer does not display angiolymphatic
invasion in
the myometrium.
Of note, there is focal squamous cell carcinoma in situ
present in
the cervix. This area, seen both on frozen section and
file slides,
arises in association with squamous metaplasia and was
initially
felt to represent a type of atypical reserve cell
hyperplasia at the
transformation zone. However, in immunostains (using
tissue block
A4), while p53 staining is minimal, there is ""full
thickness"" MIB-I
and p63 staining in the area of histologic concern
supporting the
diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma in situ. This

Addendum
Addendum
Immunostains for ER and PR are performed on a representative block of endometrial tumor (ES). The tumor is ER
negative (1+, <1% )and PR negative (0). In addition ,an immunostain for the vascular endothelial marker Factor VIII
related antigen is performed on a section of the cervix (E3) with foci suspicious for lymphovascular invasion.
Lymphovascular invasion is identified, which is confirmed on the immunostain.
For cases in which immunostains are performed ,the following applies: Appropriate internal and/or external positive and
negative controls have been evaluated .Some of the immunohistochemical reagents used in this case may be classified
as analyte specific reagents (ASR). These were developed and have performance characteristics determined by the
Laboratories .These reagents have not been cleared or
approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not
necessary .These tests are used for clinical purposes. They should not be regarded as investigational or for
research. This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA-88) as
qualified to perform high complexity clinical laboratory testing."," Site: Cervix and Uterus
Justification: The report mentions measurements and findings from both the cervix (e.g., length of endocervical canal, appearance of the ecto- and endocervix) and the uterus (e.g., length and width of endometrial cavity, myometrial invasion).

Laterality: Not provided
Justification: The report does not mention any laterality-related information, as it describes findings that are not specific to one side of the body.

Histology: Adenocarcinoma
Justification: The report mentions a ""tumor"" in the endometrial cavity, which is described as tan, soft, and exophytic. The immunostains for ER and PR are negative, suggesting a non-endometrioid type of endometrial carcinoma, most likely an adenocarcinoma.

Stage: Not provided
Justification: The report does not contain enough information to determine the stage of the cancer accurately. FIGO staging for endometrial cancer depends on factors such as the depth of myometrial invasion, involvement of cervical stroma, and presence of extra-uterine spread, which are not all mentioned in this report.

Grade: Not provided
Justification: The report does not contain enough information to determine the grade of the cancer accurately. Grading of endometrial adenocarcinoma is based on architectural features (e.g., gland formation, nuclear atypia) which are not described in this report.

Behavior: Malignant
Justification: The report describes a tumor in the endometrial cavity with negative ER and PR immunostains, consistent with a malignant neoplasm.",Adenocarcinoma,,,Malignant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

COMMENT :The high grade Muller ian-derived endometrial carcinoma shows
endometrioid features with associated malignant squamous changes (adenosquamous
carcinoma ).There is some ""'spindling""Istreaming of the endometrioid component. Some
cytoplasmic clearing is noted ,raising the possibility of a clear cell component, but the
overall cytoarchitectural features of those areas of the tumor showing clearing favor
squamous change over a clear-cell carcinoma component. Selected slides were
reviewed in consultation with Dr.

Clinical Diagnosis:
Endometrial cancer"," Site: Uterus
Justification: The gross description indicates the presence of an endometrial tumor in the uterus.

Laterality: Not applicable as the primary tumor is in the uterus which is a midline structure.

Histology: Adenocarcinoma
Justification: Although not explicitly stated, endometrial cancer is most commonly a type of adenocarcinoma.

Stage: Not provided
Justification: The stage of cancer cannot be determined from the given information as it requires additional information such as the extent of spread and lymph node involvement.

Grade: Not provided
Justification: The grade of the tumor, which indicates how aggressive it is likely to be, cannot be determined from the given information.

Behavior: Malignant
Justification: Endometrial cancer is a malignant tumor, meaning it can invade and destroy surrounding tissue, and may spread to other parts of the body.",Adenocarcinoma,,,Malignant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MICROSCOPIC :Microscopic examination is performed. Page 4of5
COMMENT :The neoplasm in the endometrium is a papillary serous
carcinoma. There are foci within the neoplastic growth that have an
endometrioid appearance ;however,thesefoci have Grade3 nuclei and,
overall, are estimated to comprise less than 25% of the total mass of
the neoplasm . Accordingly, it is felt that one cannot justify
classifying this as mixed carcinoma .The neoplasm shown extensive
lymphvascular invasion involving.the myometriuta in this manner with
relat very ` i3: 1 owif rec ex tension into the myomerum. arame ria1
tissue on each side of theuterusis involved, and this appears to be
mainly lymphvascular spread. Twelve of nineteen lymph nodes contain
metastatic carcinoma , and both ovaries contain metastatic carcinoma.
The metastatic deposits are similar to theneoplasm seen in the
endometrium.
Omentum and vermiform appendix are uninvolved by neoplasm.
DIAGNOSIS:
A. Right periaortic node:
1. Papillary serouscarcinoma, metastatic, in three of four lymph
nodes.The nodes are disrupted making it not practicable to measure the
size of the metastasis accurately.
2. Extra nodal extension is judged to belikely.
B. Left periaortic node:
Lymph node, one, free of neoplasm.
C. Left common node:
-Lymph node, one (microscopic finding). Metastatic carcinoma is
present in the node.
D. External iliac node:
Lymph nodes ,three,free of neoplasm.
E. Obturator node:
1. Papillary serous carcinoma, metastatic, in two lymph nodes.
2. The largest metastasis measures 2.8 cm in greatest dimension.

J. Uterus ,tubes,ovaries and cervix:
1. Papillary serous carcinoma ,endometrium .See comment.
2. The neoplasm , by direct extension , involves the myometrium to a
depth of approximately 0.6 cm in an area where the myometrium measures
1.5 cm in greatest dimension. However, the neoplasm involves
intramyometrial lymphatics extensively, and focally is present within
O.lcm of the serosalsurface .Several of .theseintravascular foci are
seen near 7 95 seroua.
3. The neoplasm extends along the surface of the uterine cavity to
involve the lower uterine segment and upper endocervical canal. The
involvement is along the surface with no significant penetration of
subjacent myometrium.
4. The neoplasm measures 4 cm in greatest dimension and involves the
entire endometrial cavity.
5. Adenocarcinoma is present in right and left parametrial tissue.
6. Lymph node status : papillary serous carcinoma ,metastatic, in 12
of 19lymphnodes.See parts A through I of the specimen.

GROSS EXAMINATION:
A. ""Uterus, tubes and ovaries (AF1)"", received fresh for frozen section and
transferred to formalin at ^on is a 95 gram, B.7 x 5.6 x 4.1 cm
uterus with attached 3.5 cm cervix with a 0.5 cm patent os. The ectocervix is
tan-pink and smooth with no gross lesions identified. The specimen is opened
to reveal a 3.5 cm x 4 cm endometrial cavity which is fully covered by a
tan-brown friable lesion. The estimated tumor size of the lesion is 4 x 2.5
cm and demonstrates possible gross invasion of 0:2 cm into a 2 cm
myometrium. The tumor extends to 4 cm of the cervical opening and appears to
partially involve the lower uterine segment. The myometrium is tan and
partially trabeculated with no nodules identified. The left ovary, 2.9 x 1 x
0.8 cm and left fallopian tube, 6.5 cm long x 0.9 cm in diameter are grossly
unremarkable. The right ovary, 3 x 1.4 x 0.6 cm is grossly unremarkable. The
fimbriated right fallopian tube, 5.5 cm long x 0.9 cm in average diameter
demonstrates multiple paratubal cysts up to 1.5 cm. A representative section
of the posterior endomyometrial mass is frozen (remnant Al). The serosal
surface is tan-pink and smooth with no grossly identified lesions.

LOCATION OF TUMOR: The bulk of invasive tumor is based in the high endocervical canal , with extension of invasive
tumor to the lower uterine segment. Adenocarcinoma replaces much of the mucosal surface of the upper endometrial
cavity, without myometrial invasion.
HISTOLOGIC TYPE: Moderately differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma (see comment)
HISTOLOGIC GRADE (FIGO): FIGO grade 2 (architecture grade 2 ,nuclear grade 2).
EXTENT OF INVASION: The greatest depth of invasion is at the anterior endocervix, where adenocarcinoma invades
1.1cm and approaches to a distance of less than 0.5mm from the paracervical soft tissue margin (96% wall invasion).
SEROSAL INVOLVEMENT: Not identified
LOWER UTERINE SEGMENT INVOLVEMENT: Present in the posterior wall, with depth of invasion 0.5cm where wall
thickness is 1.8cm (27%).
CERVICAL INVOLVEMENT: Present ,with extensive stromal invasion (see above).
ADNEXAL INVOLVEMENT (SEE BELOW): Not identified.
CERVICAL/VAGINAL MARGIN AND DISTANCE :Negative ;invasive carcinoma approaches to a distance of 0.2cm from the
anterior ectocervical mucosal margin.

Comment:
The specimen shows moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with characteristic squamous morular growth pattern,
suggestive of an endometrioid type histology .The tumor is negative for estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor.
The tumor is positive for p16, but given the endometrioid histology the significance of this is unclear. The bulk of
invasive tumor is present in the high endocervical canal .According to clinical notes, the patient had a diagnostic
endometrial biopsy in with endometrioid adenocarcinoma (FIGO 2). External beam radiation therapy followed.
Endometrial biopsy in : returned endometrioid adenocarcinoma (FIGO 3 ).It is possible that while much of the
upper corpus tumor responded to therapy ,residual adenocarcinoma in the LUS/endocervical canal region has selectively
recurred .Alternatively ,the endocervical tumor location and lack of upper corpus myometrial invasion raises
the possibility of an endocervical primary tumor. Clinical correlation is advised.
Clinical History:
The patient is with endometrial carcinoma.
Gross Description:

Attending Pathologist :I have personally conducted the evaluation of the above specimens and have
rendered the above diagnosis(es)."," Site: Uterine cervix and corpus
Laterality: Not provided (as it's a bilateral process)
Histology: Endometrioid adenocarcinoma
Stage: pT2b (based on the full thickness defect in the lower uterine segment/endocervical canal)
Grade: Moderate (given the description of moderately differentiated tumor)
Behavior: Malignant (as it's an invasive cancer)

Justification: The pathology report describes a moderately differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma with a full thickness defect in the lower uterine segment/endocervical canal, indicating a tumor that involves both the cervix and corpus of the uterus. The stage is assigned as pT2b based on this finding. The grade is given as moderate due to the use of the term ""moderately differentiated.""

0"," 1. ""Site"": Uterus, cervix, ovaries, and fallopian tubes. Justification: The report mentioned a total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy of these organs.
2. ""Laterality"": Not provided. Justification: The report does not specify the laterality as it involves multiple organs on both sides of the body.
3. ""Histology"": Adenocarcinoma, endometrioid type. Justification: The report clearly states the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma in the endometrium of the uterus.
4. ""Stage"": Not provided. Justification: The TNM stage cannot be determined without information on tumor size, lymph node involvement, and metastasis.
5. ""Grade"": Grade 2 (intermediate grade or moderately differentiated). Justification: The nuclear and architectural grades are both reported as Grade 2 in the endometrioid type of adenocarcinoma.
6. ""Behavior"": Malignant. Justification: Adenocarcinoma is a malignant tumor by definition, and this report confirms lymphovascular invasion.","Adenocarcinoma, endometrioid type",,Grade 2 (intermediate grade or moderately differentiated),Malignant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DIAGNOSIS:
A. Uterus, bilateral ovaries and fallopian tubes;
hysterectomy and
bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy: FIGO grade I (of III)
endometrial
adenocarcinoma, endometrioid type, arising in a background
of
complex hyperplasia with atypia, forming an exophytic mass
(2.8 x
2.5 x 1.9 cm) located in the anterior uterine wall. The
tumor
invades 0.2 cm into the myometrium (total wall thickness
2.4 cm).
The tumor does not involve the endocervix and the cervix
is
unremarkable. Lymphovascular space invasion is not
identified.
Multiple (2) intramural leiomyomata ranging in size from
2.2 cm to
3.5 cm in greatest dimension are identified. The
bilateral ovaries
and fallopian tubes are without diagnostic abnormality.
B. Lymph nodes, right pelvic, lymphadenectomy: Multiple
(17) right
pelvic lymph nodes are negative for tumor.
C. Lymph nodes, left pelvic, lymphadenectomy: Multiple
(3) left
pelvic lymph nodes are negative for tumor.
With available surgical materials, [AJCC pTlaNO](7th
edition, 2010).
This final pathology report is based on the
gross/macroscopic
examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation
of the
11 specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent
sections are
reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive
changes
identified on permanent section review will be reflected
in a
revised report.
GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. Received fresh labeled ""uterus, right fallopian tube
and ovary""
is a 176.0 gram uterus with attached bilateral tubes and
ovaries.
The uterine serosa is smooth. There is a 2.8 x 2.5 x 1.9
cm
exophytic mass in the left anterior wall of the
endometrial cavity
grossly invades 0.2 cm to the myometrium. The myometrial
thickness

Comment:
The hysterectomy specimen is received disrupted at the junction of the upper anterior endocervix/anterior lower uterine segment.
A large amount of detached tumor is also received separately
within the container. Recommend correlation with operative
procedure. Specimen B (right pelvic lymph node) is a large lymph
node which is entirely replaced by metastatic serous carcinoma.
There is no definite extracapsular invasion identified in
representative sections; however, the tissue is focally
disrupted.
Representative sections show predominantly serous carcinoma.
Additional representative sections are submitted and one shows a
sarcomatous component (A17). Previous biopsy also shows
carcinosarcoma with homologous typeThe
findings are consistent with carcinosarcoma with serous
carcinomatous component and homologous sarcomatous component.
Immunohistochemistry stains have been added on (A17) and an
addendum will be issued with the result.

Light Microscopy:
Light microscopic examination performed by Dr.
The majority of the tumor is poorly differentiated carcinoma
(serous carcinoma).
Additional representative sections are taken and one slide (A17)
shows a sarcomatous component. Immunohistochemistry is pending
on this section and an addendum will be issued with the result.
Also, the prior outside biopsy shows carcinosarcoma with
homologous type .The findings are
consistent with carcinosarcoma, with serous carcinomatous
component and homologous sarcomatous component. For cases in which immunostains are performed, the following
applies:
Appropriate internal and/or external positive and negative
controls have been evaluated. Some of the immunohistochemical
reagents used in this case may be classified as analyte specific
reagents (ASR). These were developed and have performance
characteristics determined by . These reagents have not been
cleared or approved by the US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA). The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is
not necessary. These tests are used for clinical purposes. They

Microscopic Description
The microscopic findings support the above diagnosis.
Page 2of3 Surgical Pathology Report
Page 3of3"," 1. ""Site"": The site is the uterus, as indicated by the gross description of the specimen which is a previously opened uterus with an exophytic tumor mass in the endometrial canal. Justification: The report mentions receiving a specimen labeled as ""uterus, cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries."" The tumor is located in the uterus, which is also confirmed by the gross description of the specimen.

2. ""Laterality"": Not provided. There's no information about laterality in this report as it appears that the tumor is present throughout the uterus and not localized to one side.

3. ""Histology"": The histology is endometrial adenocarcinoma, based on the microscopic findings supporting the diagnosis of a malignant neoplasm in the uterus. Justification: The report mentions that the microscopic findings support the above diagnosis and the above diagnosis is endometrial carcinoma.

4. ""Stage"": Not provided. The TNM (Tumor, Node, Metastasis) staging system wasn't mentioned in this report.

5. ""Grade"": The grade is not explicitly stated in the report, but it can be inferred as high-grade or poorly differentiated based on the description of the tumor as an exophytic mass with focal necrotic softening and cutting into the myometrium to a depth of 2.0 cm. Justification: The tumor's size, shape, and cutting deeply into the myometrium suggest that it is a high-grade or poorly differentiated tumor.

6. ""Behavior"": The behavior of this tumor is malignant, as evidenced by the microscopic findings supporting the diagnosis of endometrial carcinoma. Justification: Malignant neoplasms are cancerous and have the ability to invade surrounding tissues and metastasize to other parts of the body.",endometrial adenocarcinoma,,high-grade or poorly differentiated,malignant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gross Description
The specimens are received in five containers of formalin, each labeled
"" The first container is labeled ""cervix, uterus, right tube and
ovary. It contains a 600 gram, 15 x 10 x 8 cm previously opened uterus whichhas a shiny light brown serosal surface without focallesions and is obviouslydistorted by abundant myometrial nodules. The cervixmeasures 2.0 x 1.9 cm andhas a shiny white-tan ectocervical mucosa without focal lesions. The nd
transformation zone is grossly unremarkable and the endocervical canalmeasures3.8 cm in length and also has a shiny brown, unremarkable mucosa. The
endometrial cavity measures 7.0 cm long x 5 cm wide x 0.5 cm in depth and has a
finely folded light brown endometrium with a fun9ating, soft and irregular tan
mass over the most superior aspect of the posterior wall and over thegfundus and
most superior aspect of the anterior wall. There is no gross involvement of thelower uterine segment. Numerous sections through the tumor show it to beexophytic without obvious invasion into the underlying myometrium which is
markedly distorted. It has a maximal thickness of 3.6 cm and has numerous
whorled nodules (> 10) throughout with several underlying the endometrialtumwhi
oremass and ranging from 0.4 up to 6.2 cm in maximum dimension. on sectioning
there is no evidence of necrosis, hemorrhage, or cystic change. Several of

CLINICAL HISTORY:
Malignant neoplasm of corpus uteri. Laparoscopic total hysterectomy, BSO, andlymph node sampling.
GROSS EXAMINATION:
A. ""Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries (AF1-3)"", received is a 280
gram, 10.6 x 6.8 x 5.5 cm partially morcellated uterus. The specimen is
unoriented and contains one portion of the cervix (posterior cervix) which is
detached from the specimen. The endocervical canal (2.5 x 1 cm) is white-tan
and has an herringbone pattern. The endometrial canal (not able to bemeasured )has afriable, soft endometrium which begins roughly 2.5 cm from thelower uterine segment. Sectioningreveals a0.6 cm endometrium overlying a 2cm myometrium. The friable endometriumdoesnot appear to invade the
myometrium. There are multiple (greater than 20) white, whorled lesions in
the myometrium, the largest of which measures 2 x 2 x 1.9 cm. Sectioning of
these white, whorled lesions does not reveal any hemorrhage or necrosis. The
right tube (partially morcellated)and measures3 cm in length x 0.6 cm in diameter and has anunattached fimbriae. Sectioningreveals an unremarkabletube. The right ovary (2.5 x 1.2 x 1 cm) is white, cerebriform, and is
grossly unremarkable. The left tube is also interrupted but measures 2.5 cmin length x 0.6 cmin diameter. Sectioning reveals an unremarkable tube andfimbriae. The left ovary (2.6 x 1.3x 0.8 cm) is white, cerebriform, and uponsectioning contains several corpora albicantia. The serosal surface is, inareas whereit is not morcellated, smooth, tan, and grossly unremarkable.

Behavior: Malignant (based on the diagnosis of Endometrioid Adenocarcinoma)

Justification: The diagnosis is based on the immunoperoxidase tests conducted, which may not be cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration but are performed under CLIA certification for high complexity clinical testing. The tumor is located in the endometrium with focal papillary serous differentiation, indicating a high-grade malignancy.

VI. Received labeled ""omentum"" is 36.5 x 11 .7 x 1.2 cm piece of fatty tissue .No masses are found onsectioning nor are any firm areas palpated. RS-3.
VII. Received labeled ""left common node ""is fatty tissue with two pink tan apparent lymph nodesmeasuring 0.6 and 0.8 cm .Both are bisected ,larger toto-A ,smaller toto-B.
MICROSCOPIC :HISTOLOGIC TYPE :Endometrioid adenocarcinoma.
HISTOLOGIC GRADE :G3; poorly differentiated.
MYOMETRIAL INVASION: Present.
EXTENT OF INVASION : Tumor replaces much of the endometrial surface and invades the superficialmyometrium. A maximum 0.7 cm of a 1.7 cm section of endomyometrium contains tumor. Tumor alsofocally involves the lower uterine segment and endocervical surface .Metastatic disease replaces theright ovary and is present in the bilateral pericoli ic tissue and sigmoid serosal samples . The nodularmass in the omentum contains metastatic tumor.
REGIONAL LYMPH NODES: Two sampled (left common area); both negative for tumor.
MARGINS: Uterine resection margins free of tumor.
VENOUSILYMPHATIC (LARGE/SMALL VESSEL) INVASION: None seen.
ADDITIONAL PATHOLOGIC FINDINGS: Focal areas of the endometrial surface show better
differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma (grade 2). However, the vast majority of tumor is growing
in solid sheets with scattered areas showing bizarre tumor giant cells, high mitotic activity and abnormal
mitotic figures. An endometrial polyp is also present and shows focal atypical adenomatous
hyperplasia.
Areas of metastatic tumor show prominent necrosis .A transfer artifact is seen in the left ovary with noevidence of tumor seen in the left fallopian tube and ovary. Right fallopian tube is not grossly orhistologically identified.
COMMENT(S): Findings are consistent with high grade endometrioid adenocarcinoma and are
consistent with an endometrial primary tumor with metastatic spread to the other involved sites.
Immunohistochemical stains : Immunohistochemical stains for cytokeratin 7, cytokeratin 20, villin and
CEA are pending to evaluate this very poorly differentiated tumor. Findings will be reported in an
addendum report.

Addendum
Addendum Disanosls
lmmunohistochemical stains : Cytokeratin 7, cytokeratin 20, CEA and villin were performed with
appropriate control reactivity. Cytokeratin 7 shows strong reactivity in the tumor cells with moderate

Justification: The report consistently mentions the hysterectomy specimens as being related to the uterus and provides a specific diagnosis of endometrial cancer.

Laterality: Not provided.

Justification: The report does not specify whether the tumor was unilateral or bilateral, as it is common in endometrial cancer for the entire uterus to be affected.

Histology: The histologic type of the tumor is reported to be endometrioid adenocarcinoma, NOS.

Representative sections submitted for frozen as AF1, f ozennsection remnant
submitted in block Al. Remaining lymph node is submitted in block A2.
B. ""Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries"", received fresh and placed in
formalin at on is a 390 gram (post fixed weight), 14.5 x 2 x 7.5
cm uterus with a 2.2 cm in diameter cervix with a 1 cm patent os. The serosa
is pink-tan with eight subserosal nodules, ranging from 0.3 to 3.6 cm in
greatest dimension. A 1.1 x 0.9 x 0.3 cm pedunculated subserosal nodule is
present. The serosa is inked black. A 0.5 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm cyst is seen in the
anterior endocervical canal, 1.3 cm away from the ectocervix. The surrounding
tissue of the cervix is inked blue.
A 10.2 x 8.5 cm area of irregularity is noted in the endometrial cavity,
centered in the fundus of the uterus and involving right and left cornu. The
majority of the lesion overlies the 6.2 x 8.5 x 4.5 cm submucosal diffusely
calcified white whorled like nodule. The lesion extends to 4.7 cm away from
the anterior ectocervix. On cut surface the endometrium is 0.2 cm in
thickness and the myometrium is 1.6 cm in thickness. The lesion grossly
extends into the inner third of the myometrium. A 3.8 x 2.2 x 2.8 cm
endometrial polyp is seen adjacent to the right cornu. The polyp is 0.5 cm
away from the primary lesion. Further sectioning reveals three intramural
white whorled like nodules ranging from 0.5 through 1.4 cm in greatest
dimension. A 1.1 x 0.9 x 0.7 cm calcified submucosal nodule is seen in theposterior segment of the uterus.
The right fallopian tube is 8.5 cm in length x 0.6 cm in diameter, sectioningreveals no massesor lesions. The right ovary is 3.5 x 2.4 x 1.3 cm with a
1.5 x 1.1 x 0.9 cm simple cyst. Sectioning reveals yellow lobulated cut
surface with a simple uniloculated cyst with no excrescences. The left
fallopian tube is 8.3 cm in length and 0.8 cm in diameter, sectioning revealsno masses
or lesions. The left ovary is 3 x 1.6 x 0.5 cm. The cut surface isyellow-tan and lobulated with no grossly evidentmasses or lesions.

Received is a single formalin filled container labeled with the patient's name,
and ""uterus and cervix."" The specimen consists of a
hysterectomy specimen including a uterus (11 x 9.8 x 7.2 cm) and attached
cervix. The uterus has been previously incised and the parametrial soft tissue
is inked in blue. The serosa is pink-tan, smooth and glistening with no apparent
abnormalities. The ectocervix is pink-tan with a smooth and glistening mucosa
and has dimensions of 2.7 x 2 cm. The external os is slit like with a diameter
of 1.1 cm. The endocervix, which has a length of 2.1 cm, has a pink-tan mucosa
with the normal palmate folds. The endometrial cavity (3.2 cm cornu to cornu,
5.4 cm from fundus to lower uterine segment) is pink-tan and focally hemorrhagic
with a thickness averaging 0.2 cm. The myometrium is remarkable for a 4.9 x 4.8
x 4.5 cm solitary, exophytic mass on the anterior aspect of the uterus that
comes to within 2.5 cm of the lower uterine segment. The cut surface is
tan-white, fleshy and variegated with focal areas of hemorrhage and necrosis.
The remaining myometrium is unremarkable and is pink-tan, finely trabeculated
with a greatest thickness of 2.8 cm.

COMMENT:Much of the tumor is composed of poorly differentiated carcinomatous
areas, with foci of squamous, endometrioid, and clear cell appearing tumor.
Some areas show definite evidence of sarcomatous differentiation, including
cartilaginous appearing areas as well as foci resembling rhabdomyosarcoma.
Heterologous elements are thus present.
I certify that I personally conducted the diagnostic evaluation of the above
specimen(s) and have rendered the above diagnosis(es).

Gross Description
The specimen is received fresh in 5 containers designated with the patient's name
Part A is designated ""uterus, cervix, R/L tubes/ovaries, other tissue consistent with tumor"". The specimen
consists of a total hysterectomy specimen to include a uterus with attached cervix and attached bilateral
adnexa. Separate in the container are fragments of tan-gray friable soft tissue, approximately 6.5 x 6.5 x 3.4
cm in aggregate dimension. The separate tissue within the container was discussed with
who states that it originated from within the uterus. No tissue was seen outside of the uterus at the time ofoperation.
The left fallopian tube with fimbriae is 3.5 cm in length and 1.0 cm in diameter. The ovary is tan-pink, 1.5 cm in
greatest dimension. Bivalving reveals a normal ovarian architecture. The right fallopian tube with fimbriae is 3
cm in length and 0.7 cm in diameter. The ovary is tan-pink, 1.2 cm in greatest dimension. Serially sectioningreveals a normal ovarian architecture.

The uterus/cervix is 166 g, 8.5 x 7.2 x 4.3 cm. The serosa contains a small amount of fibrous and hemorrhagic
adhesions. The cervix is tan-pink, slightly hemorrhagic, 2.2 x 2.0 x 0.7 cm with an oval, patent os. The
paracervical/parametrial margin is inked black. Upon bivalving, the endocervical canal is 1.0 cm, and the
endometrial cavity is approximately 4.5 cm from cornu to cornu. Within the endometrium is a large tan-gray
fungating mass involving 80% of the anterior endometrium and approximately 10% of the posterior
endometrium. The mass is approximately 8.5 x 4.5 x 2.5 cm, extends to the lower uterine cavity, but does not
appear to involve the lower uterine cavity or cervix. It is approximately 3.2 cm from the squamocolumnar
junction and 2.2 cm to the anterior parametrial margin. Sectioning the anterior endometrium/myometrium, the
mass extends into the myometrium approximately 0.6 cm, involving approximately 25% of the myometrium and
is approximately 0.8 cm from the serosa. Sectioning the posterior endometâ€¢ium/myometrium, the endometrium
involves approximately 25% of the myometrium on the posterior side as well. The specimen is submitted asper code of sections.

The ectocervix (2.5 x 1.8 cm) is covered by white smooth glistening mucosa with focal
submucosa hemorrhage. The external OS is oval and measures 1.0 x 0.7 cm. The
endocervical canal is 2.5 cm long and covered by pink tan mucosa with multiple cysts,
wti.ich is consistent with Nabothian cyst. There is an elevated pale tan firm
endoretrial tumor. (6.0 x 5.5 cm and 1.0 cm above the surface) with irregular friahie
surface involving the anterior surface and part of right posterior surface of the
enciomet.rial cavity, Tumor grossly appears to involve the lower uterine segment at
the presumed twelve o'clock position. Grossly, tumor does not appear to involve the
enclo-ectocervLcai canal. Upon sectioning , the maximum thickness of the tumor is
1.2 cm. The area of deepest invasion of tumor is located in the lower anterior
uterine wall; in this area tumor appears to invade at least the inner half of the
myometrium. The myometr ium measures approximately 1.4 cm at the location with deepest
tumor invasion. The endometrium uninvolved by tumor (posterior surface of the
endometrial cavity) measures 0.1 cm in thickness. The maximum thickness of the
myometrium is 1.6 crn. The serosal surface of the uterus is pink tan smooth without
adhesions.

Comment
Tumor has two different patterns. In the better differentiated areas it forms tubuloglandular
structures while in the other areas it has a solid pattern with high-grade cytologic atypia and an
undifferentiated appearance and this solid component is more than 50% of the tumor. There is
extensive lymphovascular space involvement within myometrium. The tumor within vascular
spaces has the undifferentiated morphology.
Immunohistochemistry staining reveals positive staining of tumor cells in the glandular areas for
estrogen receptor (ER) and focally progesterone receptor (PR). ER and PR are negative in the
solid component. P53, synaptophysin and chromogranin markers also appear negative.

** END OF REPORT **"," Site: Uterus, cervix, and both fallopian tubes and ovaries
Laterality: Right and left sides specified for affected structures
Histology: Adenocarcinoma or similar malignancy in the uterine endometrium, with possible tumor involvement in the cervix; benign or uncertain findings for fallopian tubes and ovaries
Stage: Not provided (requires additional clinical information)
Grade: Not provided (requires microscopic evaluation)
Behavior: Malignant, given the description of a friable tumor invading the myometrium

Justification: The gross description suggests a malignant tumor in the uterine endometrium with potential involvement in the cervix. Although histological confirmation is required for definitive diagnosis and staging, the report's findings indicate a malignancy based on the terms used (e.g., friable, invasive). The fallopian tubes and ovaries have benign or uncertain findings, but they are included in the description due to their proximity to the primary tumor.","Adenocarcinoma or similar malignancy in the uterine endometrium, with possible tumor involvement in the cervix; benign or uncertain findings for fallopian tubes and ovaries",,,"Malignant, given the description of a friable tumor invading the myometrium",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A-D. A microscopic examination was performed to render the above diagnosis.
A. The specimen is received fresh in a single container ,labeled with the patient's name and number, and
marked as ""pelvic washings with 1000 units of Heparin .""It consists of approximately 25 cc of yellow
watery fluid. Two cytospins are obtained.
B. The specimen is received in fixative in a single container labeled with the patient 's name and number
and marked as ""uterus ,cervix, tubes and ovaries .""Itconsists of a hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-
oophorectomy specimen weighing 252 grams .The uterus measures 11 x 12 x 5 cm and is in continuity
with the right 2 x 1 .3 x 1 cm and left 1 .7 x 1.7 x 0. 8 cm ovaries and the fimbriated, right and left fallopian
tubes ,the right 5 x 0.5 cm and the left 6.5 x 0.5 cm.

Histology: Endometrioid Adenocarcinoma
Stage: pT1a pNX pMX (Pathologic Stage based on the current tissue specimen)
Grade: FIGO Grade 3
Behavior: Malignant

Justification: The diagnosis is based on the microscopic examination of the hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy specimen, which revealed a high-grade malignancy - Endometrioid Adenocarcinoma in the uterus with maximum depth of myometrial invasion of 0.4 cm. The cervix, serosa, and specimen margins were free of tumor. No evidence of lymphovascular invasion was found. Ovaries and fallopian tubes were also free of tumor.

For the lymph node dissections and biopsy, no malignancy was identified in any of the nodes. However, since not all regional lymph nodes were removed and examined (pNX), the nodal status cannot be determined.",Endometrioid Adenocarcinoma,pT1a pNX pMX,FIGO Grade 3,Malignant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

COMMENT :The endometriold carcinoma component ,which accounts for at least 90% of
the neoplasm ,Is predominantly exophytic and exhibits papillary villoglandular features.
The FIGO grade of the endometriold tumor component Is based on the combined
architectural features and. nuclear grade for that component .There Is also a minor (by
volume )component of high .nuclear grade uterine papillary serous carcinoma. There are
a few ""free-floating "" fragments of tumor w ithin spaces ,some of which may represent
lymphovascular spaces ,but they are interpreted as dissection strays. has
also reviewed selected sections of the uterine tumor and concurs with the ciassrmrcation
of the neoplasm and also agrees .that there Is no unequivocal lymphovascular invasion
by tumor (IDC2bJ .The preliminary pathologic findings were relayed to on
COMMENT EXPLAINING THE CORRECTION :The phrase ,high-grade, was used twice
(before and.after the phrase ,serous type, in the original diagnosis ,which was obviously
redundant .One of the phrases has now been removed .In the synoptic report, a
typographical error for the FIGO stage has been corrected . (FIGO stage IE has been
changed to FIGO stage [A). There Is no change In the actual diagnosis..

carcinomaOn the anterior uterine serosa, there is a microscopic

While the presence of calcifications may suggest the
possibility of
a serous carcinoma, the tumor cell morphology appears too
small for
that designation. Furthermore, the presence of
endometriosis with a
granulomatous, giant cell, and fibrohistiocytic reaction
suggests
the possibility that this cancer has arisen from
endometriosis.
A third.^ocus of cancer is present in the right ovary and
represents

Slow grade
endometrioid cancer arising from an atypical endometrioid
adenofibroma of the ovary. However, cancer arising from
an
endometriotic cyst cannot be completely excluded.
The left ovary and left and right fallopian tubes are
negative for
tumor.
Comment:
Despite thorough sampling of the intrauterine tumor, there
does not
appear to be any cancer morphology which unequivocallly
matches the
anterior serosal cancer implant. Furthermore, in
immunoperoxidase
studies performed using tissue from the anterior uterine
serosa (Al)
and intrauterine tumor (A2), the cancer in the uterine
serosa shows
' strong and diffuse reactivity with antibodies to p53 and
MIB-1
without reactivity with antibodies to estrogen receptors.
Conversely, the intrauterine endometrial cancer shows
reasonably
strong (roughly 50% of the cells) positivity with estrogen
receptors
with attenuated reactivity with antibodies to p53 and MIB-
1 (again,
about 50% of the tumor cells positive). These
immunoresults
indicate that the cancer focus on the anterior uterine
serosa is
higher grade than the intrauterine cancer. However, they
do not
establish how this uterine serosal focus developed.
ADDENDUM:
HNPCC screen will be performed on endometrial cancer tissue
sections (block A2) â€¢ADDENDUM:
At the request of the clinical service involved in the
care of the
patient, immunohistochemical staining for DNA mismatch
repair
enzymes MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 was performed on the
paraffin-embedded endometrium cancer sections (block A16).
There is
aberrant loss of expression of MLH1 and PMS2 within the
malignant
cells. Internal positive control staining is present. MSH2
and MSH6
expression is intact within both the neoplastic and non-
neoplastic
cells. The findings confirm defective DNA mismatch repair
due to
loss of MLH1 expression with secondary loss of PMS2.
Differentiation
between germline and somatic MLH1 abnormality will require
mutation
analysis.

Comments
Histologic sections demonstrate a poorly differentiated papillary
serous carcinoma involving much of the endometrial cavity. While
grossly suspicious for invasion ,no definitive myometrial invasion
is identified in the multiple sections examined .However ,within the
left ovary a single microscopic focus of tumor ( less than 1mm) with
associated hemorrhage and necrosis is noted .Though microscopic,
this is consistent with an area of adnexal involvement. Clinical
correlation Is recommended.
At the request of the undersigned pathologist ,these slides have
been additionally reviewed by Dr.40Mwho concurs with the
diagnosis.

EMD"," Site: Uterine corpus
Laterality: Not applicable (in this case, the tumor is in the body of the uterus, so there is no laterality)
Histology: Endometrioid adenocarcinoma
Stage: pT1b (IB), based on the depth of myometrial invasion
Grade: FIGO grade 3
Behavior: Malignant (the tumor is invasive and can spread to other parts of the body)

Justification: The site of the tumor is the uterine corpus, as indicated in the specimen description. The laterality is not provided, but it is not applicable in this case because the tumor is in the body of the uterus. The histologic type is endometrioid adenocarcinoma, and the tumor has invaded more than half of the myometrium (pT1b), making it at least stage IB. The FIGO grade is 3, which indicates a high-grade tumor.

bilateral salpingo-oophorectomyspecimenwith attached cervix045 cm. inx 8 x 5.5
diameter with a 0.6 cm patent os). The serosalsurfaceis remarkable forinnumerable brown, red and white irregularities which stud the serosal
surface. The endocervical canal (3 cm in in length x 0.5 cm in diameter) is
white-tan and demonstrates a herringbone appearance (Cl anterior cervix, C2posterior cervix). The cervixdoes not appearto be involved with the irregularwhite masses
. The endometrial canal (8 cm in length x 4 cm from
cornu to cornu) is red and hemorrhagic and demonstrates innumerable white
irregular lesions. Sectioning the endometrium
demonstrates a 0.1 cm endometrium
overlying a 1.8 cm myometrium with innumerable white, nodular,
invasive lesions. These lesions appear to extend through the myometrium to
the serosa. The lower uterine segment grossly appears to be involved (C3
anterior lower uterine segment, C4 lower uterine
segment). C5 and C6 areanterior and posterior endomyometrium respectively. C7 demonstrates serosalnodules.
The right tube (5.5 cm in length x 0.8 cm in diameter) is grossly unremarkable

eviewe"," Based on the pathology report, here are the details for each category:

1. Site: The specimens were taken from various sites including the right and left fallopian tubes and ovaries, uterus, cervix, lower uterine segment, right and left external and internal pelvic lymph nodes, right and left obturator pelvic lymph nodes, right and left common pelvic lymph nodes, hernia sac, omental nodules, right and left para-aortic lymph nodes above and below the inferior mesenteric artery, and right and left gonadal vessels. The specimens were labeled accordingly, and representative sections were submitted for examination.
	Justification: The site is crucial in determining the origin of the pathology and guiding further diagnostic and treatment plans.
2. Laterality: The specimens were taken from both right and left sides of the body, including the right ovary, right fallopian tube, right external pelvic lymph nodes, right internal pelvic lymph nodes, right obturator pelvic lymph nodes, right common pelvic lymph nodes, right para-aortic lymph nodes above and below the inferior mesenteric artery, right gonadal vessels, left ovary, left fallopian tube, left external pelvic lymph nodes, left internal pelvic lymph nodes, left obturator pelvic lymph nodes, left common pelvic lymph nodes, and left para-aortic lymph nodes above the inferior mesenteric artery.
	Justification: Laterality is essential in identifying the affected side and guiding surgical procedures and postoperative care.
3. Histology: The specimens consisted of adipose tissue, unremarkable blood vessels, and lymphatic tissue. No specific diagnosis or abnormality was reported for these specimens.
	Justification: Histology provides information about the cellular composition and structure of the tissue, which can help diagnose various pathologies.
4. Stage: The stage was not provided in the report.
	Justification: Staging is a critical factor in determining the extent of the disease and guiding treatment options. However, it may not be applicable to all specimens or cases.
5. Grade: The grade was not provided in the report.
	Justification: Grading is a measure of the severity or aggressiveness of the tumor, which can help predict its behavior and prognosis. However, it may not be relevant to all specimens or cases.
6. Behavior: The behavior was not provided in the report.
	Justification: The behavior refers to the potential for the lesion to invade surrounding tissues, metastasize, or recur. This information is essential in determining the prognosis and management of the disease. However, it may not be applicable to all specimens or cases.

Overall, the pathology report provided detailed information about the site and laterality of the specimens but lacked critical data on histology, stage, grade, and behavior. This information is necessary for a comprehensive diagnosis and treatment plan.","adipose tissue, unremarkable blood vessels, and lymphatic tissue",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

on I is a 3 x 2.5 x 0.5 cm fragment of white-tan tissue,
partially frozen as AF1. The frozen section remnant is submitted in block Al,
and the remainder of the specimen is submitted in block A2.
B. ""Uterus and cervix"", received unfixed and placed in formalin at
is a 260 gram, 11.5 x 6.5 x 4 cm uterus demonstrating a smooth, on
glistening unremarkable cervix (specimen is received opened). The endometrium
(5.8 x 5 cm) demonstrates a diffuse, exophytic, friable, tan-white tumor that
is involving the majority of the endometrial cavity (>90%). The tumor is 4 cm
from the anterior cervix, and 4.5 cm from the posterior cervix. The mass
extends 4.5 cm deep into the myometrium (4.5 cm thick), and abuts the serosa
without invading beyond the serosa. On cut section, themassdemonstrates a
fleshy, tan-yellow appearance with focal hemorrhage and necrosis. Within the
anterior endometrium, there is a smallareaof possibly uninvolved endometrium
(0.5 x 0.5 cm). Apart from the mass, no other abnormalities are seen withinthe myometrium.

specimen(s) and have rendered the above diagnosis(es)."," Site: Uterus
Justification: The specimen is a hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and the diagnosis of serous adenocarcinoma is specific to the uterus.

Laterality: Not provided
Justification: The report does not mention any laterality information for the tumor.

Histology: Serous adenocarcinoma
Justification: The tumor is diagnosed as serous adenocarcinoma, a type of epithelial cancer that arises from the glandular cells lining the uterus.

Stage: 1C (FIGO)
Justification: The FIGO stage is based on the extent of the tumor, and this report indicates that there is no tumor found in the pelvic or aortic lymph nodes, and the depth of myometrial invasion is less than half.

Grade: 3
Justification: The tumor grade refers to how different the cancer cells look from normal cells and how quickly the cancer is likely to grow and spread. A grade 3 tumor has cells that are very different from normal cells and are growing and dividing quickly.

Behavior: Malignant
Justification: Serous adenocarcinoma of the uterus is a malignant tumor, meaning it can invade nearby tissues and spread to other parts of the body.",Serous adenocarcinoma,1C (FIGO),3,Malignant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Final Surgical Pathology Report
Procedure:
Diagnosis
Vagina, bladder, and rectosigmoid, pelvic exenteration:Recurrent
high-grade endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma with necrosis,
forming a 7.5 cm right paravaginal mass involving the bladder and
rectal walls; negative margins of excision.
Microscopic Description:
Microscopic examination was performed.A poorly-differentiated,
necrotic adenocarcinoma is found to form a 7.5 cm greatest dimension
mass lesion adjacent to the vagina which does not involve the vaginal
mucosa surface. Carcinoma invades the peri-vesicular soft tissue but
does not appear to involve the muscularis propria of the bladder.
There is a nodular deposit of tumor on the bladder serosal surface
which may represent a replaced lymph node. An additional tumor deposit
is present within the soft tissue, which is also possibly an additional
replaced lymph node. Carcinoma invades into but not through the
muscularis propria of the rectum. The excisional margins are free of
carcinoma.
Histologic type: Endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma, recurrent
Histologic grade: high-grade
Extent:Carcinoma invades the perivesicular soft tissue, the rectal
wall including the muscularis propria of the bowel, and the
perivaginal soft tissues.
Margins of resection: Negative
Vascular invasion: Identified

csy./Gross Description
Received fresh labeled ""vagina, bladder, rectum and portion of sigmoid
colon"" is a previously unopened 11 cm segment of distal colon with an
abundant amount of mesocolon, a 6.0 x 4.5 x 4.0 cm portion of residual
tan-pink vaginal tissue and a 4.5 x 4.5
perimeter of the urethra is inked black. The urethra is probe patent
to the bladder lumen which is lined by diffusely edematous tan-pink
mucosa.The infero-posterior bladder mucosa is slightly bosselated and
tan-red.A left ureter segment measuring 3 cm in length and 0.25 cm in
diameter is identified.A right ureter is not identified grossly.
Posterior to the vagina corresponding roughly to the Pouch of Douglas
is a retracted, fibrotic focus with subjacent induration. The surface
is inked blue. The remainder of the surfaces surrounding the attached
portion of vaginal tissue are also inked blue. The periphery of the
vaginal mucosa is inked orange for identification purposes. The
superior portion of vaginal mucosa is invaginated with an ill-defined,
focally necrotic 3.0 x 2.5 cm tan-red-purple focus posteriorly. The
proximal and distal margins of the segment of colon are 5.3 and 7.8 cm
respectively.The colonic mucosa is dark grey with regular folds and
the wall averages 0.5 cm. Occupying the central portion of the
specimen is an ill-defined, soft focally necrotic tumor mass measuring
7.5 cm (superior to inferior) by 5.8 cm (right to left) by 5.5 cm (anterior to posterior). The tumor is contiguous with the
aforementioned necrotic/discolored area of the posterior vaginal wall
and with the retracted serosa within the pouch of Douglas. The tumor
underlies the segment of bowel, grossly extending up to the muscularis.
A rubbery 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.3 cm tan-white nodule is identified along the
posterior serosal surface of the bladder. A portion of tumor is
submitted for tissue procurement as requested. A few slightly rubbery
tan-pink-red tissues in keeping with lymph nodes measuring up to 0.3 cm
are recovered from the associated adipose tissue. RS 14

GROSS EXAMINATION:
A. ""Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries"". Received fresh is a 116 gm,
9.5 x 6.4 x 4.1 cm uterus with bilateral attached adnexa. The opened specimen
discloses an exophytic 6 x 4.5 cm white-tan tumor in the anterior endometrial
cavity, extending from the fundus to the lower uterine segment. The tumor is
1.2 cm thick and penetrates 0.1 cm into the underlying 2.1 cm thick
myometrium. The remainder of the endometrial cavity (6.5 x 4 cm) is lined by a
thin 0.1 cm endometrium overlying a focally trabeculated myometrium. The
endocervical canal is trabeculated yellow-tan with no apparent gross lesions
and the exocervix is smooth and glistening with a patent 0.9 os. A
representative section of the mass has been frozen as AF1 and AF2 and the
frozen section remnants are submitted in blocks Al and A2. Additional
representative sections submitted as follows:

The immunohistachemical study of DNA mismatch repair protein expression reveals presence of MLHI ,MSH2, MSH8 and PMS2 expression in the tumor
(internal controls stain appropriately). The findings do not completely exclude underlying Lynch Syndrome since some mutations may result in intact
protein expression .If there are strong clinical findings suggesting possible Lynch Syndrome ,additional MSI by PCR testing is available and can be
ordered on the resection specimen.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
A. The entire endometrium, lower uterine segment and
endocervix are occupied by papillary serous carcinoma. A
rarepsammoma body is noted. The tumor infiltrates just greater
than one half of the cervical stroma (57%) and just over one half
of
the myometrium (54%). It is difficult to know with certainty
whether this originated within the endometrium or the endocervix.
In
the template below, it is being treated as an endometrial primary
since these tumors are more frequent in this location . Please see
the template below:
Histologic type: Papillary serous carcinoma-
Histologic grade: Poorly differentiated. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
Myometrial invasion:
6 mm. depth of invasion
11 mm.depth of myometrial thickness
54% of myometrial wall
Cervix: Also contains invasive carcinoma to a depth of 8 mm. with
a
maximal stromal thickness of 14 mm. (57%).
Primary tumor (pT) TNM: pT3b
Margins of resection: Tumor noted within vaginal stroma at margin
of resection.
Vascular invasion: Not detected.
Regional lymph nodes (pN): As per parts C through F, metastatic
disease is present to 2 of 17 lymph nodes, [**' **], pNl.
Distant metastasis (pM): Cannot be assessed.
Other findings: Adenomyosis and leiomyomata of the uterus. Right
and left ovaries and fallopian tubes, bilateral parametria all
negative for tumor.

Dual/Sycchnnous P-imary c:NYes"," Site: Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries, bilateral parametria, upper vagina, right and left pelvic lymph nodes, right paraaortic lymph nodes, omentum, left pericolic biopsy, bladder peritoneum, cul-de-sac, right pelvic biopsy, left pelvic biopsy, right pericolic biopsy, left diaphragm biopsy, and right diaphragm biopsy. The diagnosis is primarily focused on the uterus and cervix.

Laterality: Right and left sided lymph nodes are affected.

Histology: Papillary serous adenocarcinoma. This was chosen because it is the type of cancer found in the patient's uterus and cervix.

Stage: The cancer has reached at least stage IIIB, as it has invaded the myometrium and metastasized to the left pelvic lymph nodes.

Grade: Poorly differentiated. This was chosen because of the aggressive nature of the cancer.

Behavior: Malignant, as indicated by the diagnosis of papillary serous adenocarcinoma.

Notes on missing information: The patient's age and menopausal status are not provided, which could have helped in determining the primary site of the cancer. Additionally, the specific number of lymph nodes involved and the size of the tumor are not provided, which would be necessary for a more precise staging of the cancer.",Papillary serous adenocarcinoma,III(B),Poorly differentiated,Malignant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GROSS EXAMINATION:
A. ""Uterus, cervix"". Received fresh is uterus with attached fallopian tubes
and ovaries. The opened 9 x 6.5 x 4.5 cm uterus discloses massive tumor in
multiple states. Arising from the posterolateral fundal wall is a 6 x 5 x 2.5
cm tan, relatively solid, fungating tumor which projects into the endometrial
lumen, and on cross section, invades 3 mm into the 1.2 cm thick myometrium
(A4). Focally it shows hemorrhage and yellow streaks (A9, A10). Sections of
the junction of tumor and normal endometrium are in A3,13.
On the anterior mucosal surface is a slightly discolored tan-yellow plaque
which may represent tumor as a kissing lesion from that described above; there
is no apparent myometrial invasion at this point. A third area of tumor is
present as a 1.5 cm raised nodule in the posterolateral lower uterine segment
0.5 cm from the main tumor mass described above. This nodule also penetrated
3 mm into the 1.2 cm thick uterine wall. A continuous strip of uterus is
submitted to encompass the main tumormass(A5), the nodule in the lower
uterine segment (A6) and cervix (A7) (inked at inferior cut edge in A5,6).
Present in the anterior mucosa of the endometrium is a 2 mm yellow plaque
(A8). The 2.5 cm long endocervix is normal (Anterior All, Posterior A12).
The right ovary 1.5 x 1 x 0.9 cm (Al), right fallopian tube 7.5 x 0.3 to 0.5
cm (Al), left ovary 1.5 x 1 x 0.5 cm (A2), and left fallopian tube 8 x 0.3 to
0.5 cm (A2) are normal.
""B.Right obturator"", received fresh. The specimen consists of a 4.5 x 3 x
0.9 cm fibrofatty tissue which contains lymph nodes, the largest of which
measures 3 x 0.9 x 0.5 cm (B1). Eight lymph node candidates are placed in B2.
C. ""Right common"", received fresh. A 1.5 x 0.9 x 0.4 cm tan lymph node
candidate is present and is placed in toto in Blocks C1.
D. ""Right paraaortic"", received fresh. The specimen consists of a 5.5 x04 cm fib f 2.5 x . roatty tissue with lymph nodes, the largest of which measures09 x 02 ci 1.5 x ..mn (D1). Two additional lymph node candidates are placed inD2.
E. ""Left pelvic"", received fresh. The specimen consists of a 3.5 x 2.5 x 0.9
cm fibrofatty tissue with lymph nodes, the largest of which is 3 x 1.2 x 0.4
cm (El). A smaller node is also included in El.
F. ""Left obturator"", received fresh. The specimen consists of a 2.5 x 1.5 x
0.3 cm fibrofatty tissue with lymph nodes, the largest of which measures 1.4 x
0.4 x 0.3 cm (F1). Two additional node candidates are placed in Fl.
G. ""Left paraaortic"", received fresh. The specimen consists of 2.5 x
cm fibrofatt ti2x0.5 yssue with lymph nodes, the largest of which measuring
0.5 cm (G1). Two additional node candidates are placed in G1.2x1 x
H. ""Omentum x2"". Received fresh are two fragments of fatty tissue measuring
13 x 8 x 2 cm. Two lymph node candidates are in H1, four in H2, five in H3,and seven in H4.

F. LEFT OBTURATOR LYMPH NODES, 2 NODES.
G. LEFT PARAAORTIC LYMPH NODES, 3 NODES.
H. OMENTUM : FIBROFATTY TISSUE ONLY.
NOTE: The tumor is a 6 cm mass arising in the posterior lateral wall, a
subsidiary 1.5 cm nodule in the posterior lower uterine segment and a small
amount of mucosal surface tumor presumably representing that from a kissing
lesion in the anterior endometrium. The largest tumor mass projects and fills
the endometrial lumen, but invades maximally 3 mm into the myometrial wall 1.2
cm thick. The tumor, microscopically, is largely endometrioid. In the lower
uterine segment, clusters of tumor cells focally t-""- -lear cytoplasm
resembling that seen in the outside biopsy the amount of clear
cell change however is insufficient to label the tumor as clear cell
adenocarcinoma. Areas of the main tumor mass also show highly bizarre cells,someof which are multinucleate, but insufficient for the designation of giant
cell carcinoma. Focal areas also show papillarity and bulbous nuclei, but
insufficient to diagnose serous adenocarcinoma.
A 1 mm nodule in the hilar region of the ovary is composed of extremely well
differentiated tumor with cilia which I feel most likely representsa metas-tasis, but could be a microscopical focus of primary malignant serous adeno-
fibroma. Metastatic tumors to the ovary, because of the hormonal milieu in the
ovary, sometimes are more highly differentiated than the primary from whichtheycome. Finally, deep in the uterine wall are small nodules of inflamma-
tory cells. While demonstrating no obvious tumor, it may be a reaction to
tumor cells, supporting that the ovarian tumor is a metastasis."," Site: Uterus
Laterality: Not provided (as it refers to the entire uterus)
Histology: Endometrioid adenocarcinoma

Justification: The report clearly states ""ENDOMETRIUM: ENDOMETRIOID ADENOCARCINOMA, FIGO GRADE 3"" which corresponds to the 'Histology' and 'Grade' categories. The 'Site' is assumed to be the uterus as that is where endometrioid adenocarcinoma typically occurs.

latr Re iâ€¢a :cd:_ / T"," Category: Site
Justification: The report includes various sites in the abdominal cavity and lymph nodes.

Category: Laterality
Justification: The pathology is present in both left and right sides of the body.

Category: Histology
Information: Multiple types of histology are described, including atrophy, leiomyomata, mucinous cystadenoma, benign fibroadipose tissue, metastatic carcinosarcoma, and benign lymph nodes. The most significant finding is metastatic carcinosarcoma, which is a malignant tumor composed of both carcinomatous and sarcomatous elements.

Category: Stage
Justification: The stage is not explicitly provided in the report. However, given the presence of metastatic carcinosarcoma in various sites, it can be inferred that the cancer has spread beyond the primary site, indicating a later stage.

Category: Grade

The depth of invasion is difficult to determine due to extensive
involvement of adenomyosis. There is carcinoma present at a maximum depth of
0.7 centimeters in a 2.6 centimeter thick myometrium, but the vast majority of
the tumor in the myometrium is within adenomyosis, which is considered
non-invasive disease. There are foci that likely represent invasion, but
these are very small areas and the overall depth of true invasion is likely no
morethan 0.1-0.3 centimeters."," Site: Uterus

Comment :
Histologic sections of the uterine corpus cancer reveal a poorly
differentiated carcinoma with >50% solid growth in addition to
gland formation. Squamous differentiation is noted, consistent
with endometrioid subtype. Due to the presence of areas of tumor
necrosis and other features, immunohistochemistry was performed
to evaluate for other histologic subtypes. The carcinoma
exhibits generally weak staining for P53, patchy staining for
P16, and is negative for synaptophysin and chromogranin. These
results do not support serous or neuroendocrine differentiation
in this tumor.
Intraoperative Consult Diagnosis:
A frozen section was requested at am from
FSA1: Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries
- Endometrioid adenocarcinoma, Grade 2, with superficial
myometrial invasion in representative sections.
Drs. at am Clinical History:
-year-old female with endometrial cancer.
Gross Description:
Received are three appropriately labeled containers.
Container A is received fresh for frozen section and is
additionally labeled ""uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and
ovaries."" It holds a 120.1 gram, 9.4 x 6.0 x 4.5 cm uterus with
attached bilateral adnexa. The serosa is tan/pink, smooth and
glistening. The parametrial soft tissue margin is differentially
inked: posterior/black, anterior/blue. The 2.5 x 2.2 cm
ectocervix has a 0.9 cm patent os. The ectocervical mucosa is
tan/red and erythematous. The 2.2 cm long endocervical canal is
tan and trabeculated. On the right side of the endometrium
involving both the anterior and posterior walls there is an 8.0
x 3.5 x 1.5 cm tan firm exophytic mass. The mass on section
appears to superficially invade into the underlying myometrium
(FSAl). The mass comes to within 1.5 cm of the serosal surface
and is 1.0 cm from the lower uterine segment. The remainder of
the endometrium is tan, firm, and 0.1 cm thick. The myometrium
is tan, firm and up to 1.5 cm. No myometrial nodules are
present. No additional abnormalities are noted.
The right ovary is 2.0 x 1.0 x 0.8 cm. The outer surface is
tan/pink and focally red/brown. On section, the cut surface is
tan and smooth. The 3 cm in length x 0.4 cm in diameter
fimbriated fallopian tube has a tan smooth outer surface. On
section, the lumen is patent.
The left ovary is 2.0 x 1.1 x 0.6 cm. The outer surface is tan
and smooth. On section, the cut surface is tan/yellow and
unremarkable. The 2.2 cm in length x 0.4 cm in diameter attached
fimbriated fallopian tube has a tan, smooth outer surface and on
section has a patent, unremarkable lumen.

COMMENT:
The specimen is received markedly fragmented and it is difficult to determine the exact size of
leiomyosarcoma (at least 14 cm). Tumor is composed of cords of moderately to highly atypical spindle
cells in a background of loose myxoid stroma with prominent hyalinization. There is no necrosis. Mitotic
rate is up to 3 per 10 HPF. Parametrial soft tissue and bordering myometrium show infiltrative nature of
this neoplasm. Tumor is positive for desmin and vimentin and is negative for muscle specific actin,
caldesmon, CD34, CD10 and CD117. Morphology and immunoprofile are most supportive of the
diagnosis of myxoid leiomyosarcoma. Myxoid leiomyosarcomas usually display low mitotic rate, no
necrosis and moderately atypical cytology of tumor cells.

CLINICAL HISTORY:
Endometrial adenocarcinoma, FIGO grade I, possible clear cell differentiation.
GROSS EXAMINATION:
A. ""Uterus, bilateral tubes and ovaries (AF1)"", received for frozen section is
a 210 gram, 11 x 7.5 x 5 cm uterus. The parametrial soft tissues are inked
blue. The opened specimen exhibits a 3.5 x 2.2 x 2 cm, tan-yellow, polypoid
mass arising from the lower anterior wall of the uterus. Sectioning the
endomyometrium in this region reveals no gross evidence of myometrial invasion
(Al-frozen, A2-3-full-thickness, A4-polyp from myometrium junction, A5-cross
section of polyp). The myometrium underlying the tumor averages 2 cm thick.
This mass does not involve the lower uterine segment or endocervix although
there is a separate 1.6 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm tan, cervical polyp (A6-7). The
remainder of the anterior endomyometrium (A8) is 0.2 cm thick with no
additional masses. The posterior ecto and endocervix (A9) and posterior
endomyometrium (A10) are also unremarkable. The right ovary (2.2 x 2 x 1.6)
and tube (6 x 0.5 cm, transected) is unremarkable without additional masses
(All). The left ovary (2.4 x 2.2 x 1.6 cm) and tube (5 x 0.4 cm, transected)
is also unremarkable with no focal lesions.
B. ""Right pelvic nodes"", received fresh and placed in formalin is a 3.5 x 3 x
2.5 cm aggregate of tan-yellow tissue. Six lymph nodes are identified,
ranging from 0.4 to 1.6 cm in greatest dimension. The largest two lymph nodes
are submitted in blocks B1-2, respectively. B3-4 each have two lymph nodes.
The remainder of the specimen is submitted entirely in blocks B5-B7.
C. ""Left pelvic nodes"", received fresh and placed in formalin is a 4 x 3.5 x 3
cm fragment of tan-red tissue that is dissected for lymph nodes. Six lymph
nodes are identified, the largest is 3 x 2 x 2 cm and extremely fatty. Four
lymph nodes are submitted in Cl, one lymph node bisected in C2, the largest
lymph node entirely submitted in C3-7. The remainder of the specimen is

COMMENT: The endometrioid carcinoma is a grade 3 tumor in the endometrium .Some of the
metastases in the lymph nodes appear to be grade 2; however, it is difficult to grade the tumor
because there is extensive squamous metaplasia in the primary tumor as well as in the metastases
and there are clear cell changes.

PATH #:
Labeled with the patient's name, labeled ""uterus and cervix"", and received fresh for gross consultation and
subsequently fixed in formalin is a total hysterectomy specimen weighing 340 grams. The uterus is symmetric in
shape. The uterus measures 12.0 cm from the fundus to the ectocervix, 7.0 cm from cornu to cornu, and a
maximum of 6.0 cm from the anterior surface to the posterior surface. The serosal surfaces are pink-tan and
smooth. The parauterine and paracervical soft tissues are inked black. The cervix is 3.7 cm in length and up to 4.0
cm in diameter in the ectocervical region. The ectocervix is gray-white and smooth with focal pinpoint hemorrhage.
The external cervical os is 0.8 cm in length and ovoid. The specimen has been previously incised along both sides.
The endocervical canal is 2.5 cm in length and lined by pink-tan rugose mucosa. The transformation zone is
distinct. One soft sessile polypoid lesion is note don the posterior surface of the lower uterine segment measuring
0.7 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm. The polyp is 2.0 cm superior to the transformation zone. Sectioning of the cervix reveals no
gross abnormalities. No vaginal cuff is present. The endometrial cavity is 6.5 cm in length and up to 7.0 cm in
width. Within the uterus is a friable, polypoid pink-tan tumor mass that measures 10.7 x 9.5 cm in total surface area
and involves the anterior and posterior corpus and fundus as well as possible extension into the lower uterine
segment on the posterior aspect. The exophytic portions of the tumor have a maximum thickness of 2.0 cm. The
uterus has been previously sectioned revealing invasion of the wall to approximately 50% depth. No normal-
appearing endometrial lining is identified except in the lower uterine segment, where the thickness ranges from 0.2

A. UTERUS, BILATERAL TUBES AND OVARIES
Labeled with the patient 's name , labeled ""uterus, bilateral tubes and ovaries"", and received fresh in the OR for
intraoperative gross consultation and subsequently fixed in formalin is a uterus with attached bilateral tubes and
ovaries weighing 2400 grams. The uterus measures 19.0 cm from fundus to amputation site, 16.0 cm, from right to
left, and 10.0 cm from anterior to posterior. The endometrial cavity measures 12.0 cm, in length and up to 11.0 cm
in width. The right ovary measures 2.2 x 1.3 x 1.0 cm. The right fallopian tube measures 9.0 cm in length and up to
1.0 cm in diameter. The left ovary measures 2.3 x 1.3 x 1.0 cm. The left fallopian tube measures 9.0 cm in length
and averages 1.0 cm in diameter. A portion of omentum attached at the fundus measures 11.0 x 6.0 x 1.0 cm.
The endometrial cavity is filled with a large soft tan-red focally hemorrhagic and necrotic tumor mass which
protrudes from the amputation site and measures 16.0 x 15.0 x 10.0 cm. The tumor extends to the anterior and
posterior amputation sites which are inked black, extends through the uterine wall and focally invades the overlying
serosa which is inked black. An area of serosal involvement on the posterior surface measures 3.0 x 2.0 cm.
Several subserosal tumor nodules are found at the attachment site of the omentum to the fundus. The entire
endometrium is involved by tumor. Sectioning of the tumor reveals a solid soft tan-red necrotic focally
hemorrhagic and focally cystic cut surface.
The remaining serosa shows focal hemorrhage and scattered fibrous adhesions. The right ovary shows a few serosal
adhesions .The right fallopian tube is fimbriated and the mesosalpinx contains a soft ovoid tan-red nodule which
measures 1.5 x 1.3 x 1 ..3 cm. The left ovary shows some hemorrhagic adhesions .The distal 3 .3 cm of the left
fallopian tube is cystic and dilated and measures up to 1.8 cm in diameter .Sectioning portal fibrosis the distal end
reveals a unilocular cavity filled with clear watery fluid. The lining shows focal soft pink -tan nodules which
measure up to 1.0 cm .No timbria are identified .A few additional smooth -walled paratubal cysts measure up to 1.3
cm. The myometrium measures up to 3.5 cm in thickness .No definite cervical tissue is identified.

Comment: Amendment Comment:
After presentation at
clinical request was made to review depth of invasion to further
clarify inner
half (<50%) versus outer half (>50%) invasion, given that
original measurement
was exactly at 50%. Per intradepartmental review, the consensus
is invasion
into the inner half (33%) (A6). Drs. agree (intradepartmental
consultation). Immunohistochemical stain for CD31 was performed
on block A6 and
highlights a vessel around the focus initially measured at 50%
invasion,
demonstrating that this deeper focus is lymphovascular invasion
and not deep
myometrial invasion. Therefore, the stage is amended to pTla
from pTlb. The
other diagnoses are unchanged. A telephone message was sent to
Dr. regarding this amendment on

GROSS EXAMINATION:
A. ""Uterus and cervix (AF1)"", unfixed, transferred to formalin. A 59.0 gram,
10.0 x 5.0 x 3.0 cm uterine fundus and cervix. The uterine serosa is smooth
and glistening with a moderate amount of adhesions. The ectocervix measures
3.4 cm in diameter with a cervical os of 1.4 cm. The exocervix is smooth and
glistening, is pearly white and is mildly hemorrhagic. The endocervical
measures 2.7 cm and is composed of a tan, velvety trabecular mucosa. Theuterine fundus measures4.5 cm and 4.5 cm from cornu to cornu. The overlying
endometrial mucosa is tan and velvety. A 3.0 x 2.7 cm exophytic tan mass lies
on the anterior half of the uterine cavity, eccentrically towards the right
cornu. The full thickness of the uterine wall extends 1.4 cm with the
endometrium accounting for 0.1 cm. The thickness of themassis 1.0 cm, whicharises above the endometrial surface 0.5 cm. Representative samples of this
exophytic mass are in blocks Al-A2. Representative samples of uninvolved
endocervical canal and uterine fundus, anteriorly are submitted in blocks
A3-A4. Representative samples of endocervical canal and wall of uterine
fundus, posteriorly are submitted in blocks A5-A6. All remnants are placed inblock A7.

Comment:
Histologic examination reveals tumor with solid and cribriform growth patterns .Cells show enlarged nuclei with
markedly prominent nucleoli and abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm. Immunohistochemical stains were performed and
tumor cells are positive for CK 7 and show patchy positivity for p53. Immunostains for CK 20, p16, and p63 are negative.
Morphology and immunoprofile support the above diagnosis .Findings in one area raised the possibility of
lymphovascular space invasion. However , immunostains for CD31 and CD34 do not convincingly show intravascular
tumor.
Clinical History:
with endometrial cancer.

Grossing Pathologist:
Light Microscopy:
Light microscopic examination is performed by Dr.
Sections of the uterus reveal mixed patterns of endometrial adenocarcinoma. A portion of the tumor is composed of
lower grade cells forming glands and solid sheets with even luminal borders and generous pink cytoplasm .The majority
of the lesion is variably glandular and papillary with higher grade nuclei ,slit-like spaces ,and focal cell sloughing. A p53
immunohistochemical stain shows strong and diffuse nuclear staining in this latter area, with little or no nuclear staining
in the low grade component .The tumor is polypoid and superficially invades the myometrium. The right and left ovaries
and the left fallopian tube are negative for carcinoma; the right fallopian tube has a stenotic central lumen with
concentric irregular glands invested by smooth muscle ,consistent with salpingitis isthmica nodosum ;one of these
glands contains a free -floating fragment of carcinoma (block C12 ).The lower uterine segment and cervix are negative for
tumor ,and separately submitted lymph nodes are negative as well. An IHC stain for estrogen receptor shows moderate
to strong staining in a majority of tumor nuclei; an IHC stain for progesterone receptor shows moderate staining in a
small subset of tumor nuclei .Sections from mural lesions show benign proliferations of smooth muscle ,consistent with
leiomyomata.
Appropriate internal and /or external positive and negative controls have been evaluated. Some of the
immunohistochemical reagents used in this case may be classified as analyte specific reagents (ASR). These were
developed and have performance characteristics determined by the
. These reagents have not been cleared or approved by the US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA). The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary .These tests are used for clinical
purposes .They should not be regarded as investigational or for research .This laboratory is certified under the Clinical
Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA-88 )as qualified to perform high complexity clinical laboratory
testing.

specimen 2 is received fresh for intraoperative consultation labeled
""uterine fundus, bilateral adnexa, right colon, appendix, and distal
ileum."" The specimen consists of a uterus (6.0 x 5.0 x 4.0 cm) with cervix
remnant (2.0 x 1.2 cm in surface diameter, excised to a depth of 1.1 cm),
attached bilateral ovaries (2.2 x 1.2 x 0.5 cm each), bilateral fallopian
tubes (8.0 cm in length and 0.3 cm in diameter each),with adhered distal
ileum (45.2 cm in length), appendix (6.0 cm in length and 0.3 cm in
diameter), and attached colon (6.0 cm in length and 4.0 cm in
circumferential diameter) and mesenteric fat (approximately 20.0 cm).
There is an ill-defined tan, friable mass(approximately 16.0 x 16.0 x 12.0
cm) that extends from the uterine fundus through the serosa and invades the
surrounding soft tissue. The tumor is adherent to the colon, ileum and
appendix without invasion into these structures. The mass has mottled,
friable tan cut surfaces withextensive hemorrhage and necrosis. Multiple
tumor nodules involving the bowel wall, mesentery, external surface of the
right fallopian tubeare identified.
The endometrial cavity measures 4.0 x 3.0 cm and is lined by pink-tan
endometrium, 0.2 cm in average thickness. The posterior endometrium shows
an endometrial polyp (3.0 x 1.2 x 0.3 cm). The myometrium is pink-tan with
an average thickness of 2.5 cm. The myometrium shows multiple intramural
and subserosal white-tan, firm nodules (1.0 to 7.0 cm in greatest
dimension) with whorled cut surfaces. No hemorrhage,, necrosis, or
degeneration is seen .The ovaries and fallopian tubes are grossly
unremarkable.
The colonic mucosa is grossly normal. The serosa shows multiple tumor
deposits. The attached mesenteric fat has numerous tumor deposits.

Comment:
Two invasive carcinomas are identified. The endometrial
adenocarcinoma is endometrioid type, FIGO grade 3, and invades
cervical stroma. In addition, representative sections of cervix
show an adenoid basal carcinoma which is deeply invasive into
the cervix. The adenoid basal carcinoma involves seven slides
and measures 1.4 cm in greatest horizontal length on a single
slide. The exact horizontal dimension is difficult to measure
because the cervix is not submitted as to clock face; however,
the findings suggest the size is < 4 cm which is staged as pTlb.

A18-A28 - Remainder of ectocervix Light Microscopy:
Light microscopic examination performed by Dr.
Sections of the endometrial tumor show an endometrioid
adenocarcinoma with solid areas and high grade (grade 3) nuclei.
A representative section of the cervix shows a basaloid neoplasm
with focal gland formation and luminal eosinophilic material.
The basaloid neoplasm in the cervix forms small nests and
tubules, and is deeply invasive into the cervical wall. The
peripheral cells are basaloid and palisading, and there are
scattered larger luminal cells. There is no stromal response to
the basaloid carcinoma. The morphology of the two tumors is
different. Immunostains are performed on both tumors and the
rest of the cervix is submitted.
The tumor in the cervix (Al) is strongly and diffusely positive
for P16, P63 and CAM 5.2. Vimentin is subset positive. 5-100,
CEA, CD56, ER and PR are negative. Synaptophysin and
chromogranin are non-contributory as the tissue washed off the
slide. The endometrial carcinoma (A17) is P16 positive, vimentin
positive, CEA negative, P63 subset positive and shows weak
positivity for ER (1+, 40%) and positive for PR (2+, 40%) in a
subset. The morphology and immunostaining is different between
the two tumors and the morphology of the basaloid tumor in the
cervix is most consistent with adenoid basal carcinoma (a
second primary carcinoma in the cervix).
The additional sections of cervix show additional sections of
the adenoid basal carcinoma, which is deeply invasive into the
cervix. Also, two sections show involvement by endometrioid
adenocarcinoma with stromal invasion (A19, A20).
Given the differences in morphology and immunostaining, the
patient has two carcinomas, one is endometrial (endometrioid
FIGO Grade 3) with superficial invasion of the cervical stroma.
The second tumor is of primary cervical origin and confined to
the cervix (adenoid basal carcinoma). Note, Dr. has
also reviewed these two tumors and agrees with the diagnosis.
At the surface of the basaloid carcinoma, there are scattered
foci suspicious for an in situ component (high grade squamous
intraepithelial lesion). P16 and Ki-67 are performed on a
representative section (A28). A P16 strongly stains the
carcinoma and stains a subset of the in situ atypical
epithelium. Ki-67 stains scattered cells. The findings are
consistent with an in situ component in the cervix (HSIL/CIN 3).

GROSS EXAMINATION:
A. ""Uterus and cervix (AF1)"", received fresh for frozen section diagnosis is a
68 gm, 8 x 5.5 x 3 cm hysterectomy specimen with attached cervix (3 cm in
length x 3 cm in diameter) with a patent os of 0.6 cm. The serosal surface is
pink-tan and grossly unremarkable. The paracervical soft tissue is inked
entirely in blue and the specimen is opened laterally on each side. The
cervical canal (2.5 cm length x 2.4 cm wide) is tan-pink, has a herringbone
pattern. The endometrial canal (4.5 cm in length x 3 cm from cornu to cornu)
demonstrates a large, contiguous, fungating mass on the posterior portion
(beginning 1.5 cm superior to the lower uterine segment and continuing to the
anterior endometrium approximately 2.6 cm from the lower uterine segment. Both
lower uterine segments are grossly uninvolved. Serial sectioning of the
endometrium demonstrates a focally 1 cm thick endometrium overlying a 1.1 cm
thick myometrium. The area of deepest invasion is located on the posterior
surface and appears to grossly invade 0.8 cm into a 1.7 cm myometrium. The
deepest invasion on the anterior endometrium is 0.3 cm into a 1.7 cm
myometrium.

A. UTERUS, CERVIX, BILATERAL FALLOPIAN TUBES AND OVARIES
Labeled with the patient's name, labeled ""uterus, cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries"", and
received fresh in the Operating Room for gross and frozen section evaluation and subsequently fixed in
formalin is an opened 100 gram total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy specimen. The
uterus is about 7.0 x 4.9 x 4.8 cm. The cervical portion of the uterus is about 2.5 cm long and up to 2.4
cm in width. The endometrial cavity is 4.1 cm long and up to 3.6 cm in width. The endometrial rnucosa
ranges from 0.1 to 0.4 cm in thickness. The muscular uterine wall ranges from 0.9 to 2.0 cm in thickness.
There are parametrial soft tissues attached to the uterus, those on the right side are up to 0.7 cm in width
and those on the left side are up to 0.9 cm in width. The right ovary is 1.9 x 0.9 x 0.7 cm. The fimbriated
right fallopian tube is 7.5 cm long, ranges from 0.3 to 0.5 cm in diameter and has a maximum luminal
diameter of 0.1 cm. The left ovary is 1.5 x 0.9 x 0.7 cm. The fimbriated left fallopian tube is 6.8 cm long,
ranges from 0.3 to 0.5 cm in diameter and has a maximum luminal diameter of 0.1 cm.
There is a soft yellow-tan friable endometrial tumor that involves a 3.8 x 3.5 cm area of the mucosa in the
anterior uterine corpus, lower uterine segment, and fundus. Myometrial invasion by semi-firm tan-yellow
tumor is present and involves approximately 55% of the uterine wall thickness (involves up to 1.5 cm of
the wall, in an area where the maximum wall thickness is 2.5 cm). The uterine serosa is uninvolved by
tumor. The cervix, vaginal cuff and parametria appear grossly free of tumor. No metastatic tumor is seen
in the ovaries or fallopian tubes. Within the myometrium of the posterior uterine corpus, there are two ill-
defined areas of soft tan-yellow tissue. One of these areas measures 1.8 x 1.0 cm, is submucosal and
extends 0.8 cm into the myometrium. The other lesion measures 0.7 x 0.6 cm, and is intramural, and
extends up to 1.0 cm into the myometrium.
SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT
Page 2 of 4 About seven well-circumscribed uterine leiomyomas ranging from 0.2 to 2.0 cm in diameter are also
present. Most are intramural, one is submucosal, and one is subserosal. The leiomyomas are each
composed of firm solid tan-white whorled tissue without grossly evident areas of necrosis or hemorrhage.
The anterior cervix is remarkable for a 0.8 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm possible polypoid area.
Both ovaries are atrophic. The left fallopian tube is unremarkable. The right fallopian tube shows two
paratubal cysts measuring 0.2 to 0.5 cm in greatest dimension, each lined by tan smooth tissue and each
filled with clear fluid.

The tumor
shows histologic evidence of smooth muscle differentiation. A
mitotic count
reveals up to 90 mitotic figures per 10 high power fields. The
tumor
additionally shows significant cytologic atypia and coagulative t ^y
tumor necrosis.
Immunohistochemical studies show the tumor to be strongly
positive for smooth
muscle actin, desmin, estrogen receptor (2-3+, >90%) and
progesterone receptor
(2-3+, 700). The tumor is negative for OSCAR pancytokeratin.
This
immunophenotype supports the diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma.

Clinical History:
-year-old female with a cervical mass.
Gross Description:
Received are two appropriately labeled containers.
Container A is additionally labeled ""uterus and cervix."" It
contains a 1150 gram
uterus and cervix with a large mass originating from the lower
segment of the
uterus or cervix. The mass measures 18 x 14 x 8 cm. The cut
surface is nodular,
tan to brown with more fibrous areas and appears focally
necrotic. It is
predominantly well circumscribed mass. The majority of the mass
appears to have
a peritoneal lining, but orientation of the uterus in relation
to the mass is
difficult due to the distortion of the specimen. Sectioning of
the remainder of
the uterus does not reveal additional masses or nodules.
Block summary:
A1,A2 - cervix and opposing cervix
A3,A4 - grossly uninvolved myometrium and endometrium
A5-A16 - representative sections of tumor
Container B is additionally labeled ""right and left ovaries.""
The specimen
consists of two tissue fragments grossly consistent with
bilateral ovaries and
fallopian tubes which are otherwise undesignated. The larger
ovary measures 2.5
x 2.0 x 2.0 cm with a smooth lobulated white/tan to pink
external surface and a
cut surface revealing a hemorrhagic appearing corpus luteum. The
associated
fallopian tube is approximately 4 cm in length with an external diameter of 0.6

Dat< COMMENT:
As no cervical mass was identified clinically and on gross examination, including intraoperatively, the cervix was
submitted entirely for histologic examination and demonstrates poorly differentiated adenosquamous carcinoma
involving all quadrants .The tumor shows a horizontal spread of 11 mm, and Invades to the depth of 5 mm of 20 mm
cervical stromal (<1/3). The negative immuno stains for chromogranin and synaptophysin exclude neuroendocrine
differentiation .The Immunophenotype previously performed on the original endometrial curettage material
,upports the morphologic impression of an endometrial adenocarcinoma and a separate, HPV-related (diffusely
strongly positive p16) cervical carcinoma.
The focus of adenocarclnoma In the left fallopian tube has the same morphology as the endometrial adenocarcinoma,
endometrioid type .The entire fallopian tube was submitted for histologic examination and although endometriosis in
identified ,there is no transition between endometriosis and tumor and there is no evidence of complex atypical
hyperplasia. Accordingly ,the tumor in the fallopian tube interpreted as metastatic focus from the endometrial
adenocarcinoma.
The morphology of the cervical tumor is distinct from U- Andometrial tumor ;they are synchronous primary tumors.

the
myometrium to a depth of 1.5 cm (myometrial thickness 1.6
cm). The
lower uterine segment and cervix is also involved by
tumor.
Immunohistochemical stains (estrogen receptor,
progesterone
receptor, pCEA, vimentin) and HPV in situ hybridization
was
performed on the paraffin embedded uterine tissue. The
neoplastic
cells are focally positive for estrogen receptor, positive
for
vimentin and lack staining for progesterone receptor and

Addendum
Addendum
Immunostains for ER and PR are performed on representative blocks of the endometrial tumor (A16) and the tumor in
the right ovary (A12). The endometrial tumor is ER positive (1+, 20%) and PR weakly positive (1+, 2%). The tumor in
the ovary is ER positive (3+, 70%) and PR positive (3+, 65%). The tumor in the ovary is more strongly ER/PR positive than
the tumor in the endometrium ,however the findings are still considered to be best classified as a primary endometrial
tumor with ovarian metastases .Clinical correlation is suggested.
For cases in which immunostains are performed ,the following applies: Appropriate internal and /or external positive and
negative controls have been evaluated .Some of the immunohistochemical reagents used in this case may be
classified as analyte specific reagents (ASR). These were developed and have performance characteristics determined by
the These reagents have not been cleared or
approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not

Laterality: Right and left pelvic regions
Histology: Endometrial carcinoma with metastases to bilateral adnexa
Stage: Not provided in the given information, but typically determined by surgical staging
Grade: Low overall FIGO grade
Behavior: Malignant, as it is a primary endometrial tumor with metastases to the ovaries

Justification: The tumor was found primarily in the endometrium and extended to involve both ovaries. Although the overall FIGO grade is low, the pattern of spread and similar morphologic features suggest that this is a primary endometrial tumor with metastases to the bilateral adnexa.

Laterality: Not provided, as laterality refers to the side of the body where the disease is located, and in this case, the cancer is present throughout the uterus, affecting both sides.

Histology: The histology of the cancer is a carcinosarcoma (malignant mixed Mullerian tumor). This type of tumor contains both carcinomatous and sarcomatous components.

Stage: The cancer is at FIGO stage II, as it has invaded less than half of the myometrium and involves the cervical stroma.

Grade: Not provided, as the report does not mention the grade of the carcinoma or carcinosarcoma. Grade refers to how differentiated the cancer cells are and how quickly the cancer is likely to grow and spread.

Behavior: The behavior of this cancer is malignant, meaning it is cancerous and has the potential to invade surrounding tissues and metastasize to other parts of the body.

Histology: Endometrioid adenocarcinoma
Stage: pTlc (IC), pNO, pMX; this is a uterine cancer that has invaded half or more of the myometrium, with no regional lymph node metastasis detected, but distant metastasis cannot be assessed
Grade: Architectural grade II/III, high-grade nuclear atypia (grade III)
Behavior: Malignant, as it is a cancer with invasive properties and high-grade features

Justification: The pathology report provides information on an endometrioid adenocarcinoma with high-grade nuclear atypia. The staging information indicates that the tumor has invaded half or more of the myometrium, but there is no evidence of regional lymph node metastasis. However, distant metastasis cannot be assessed. The high-grade nuclear atypia (grade III) suggests a more aggressive behavior, consistent with malignant neoplasms.",Endometrioid adenocarcinoma,"pTlc (IC), pNO, pMX","Architectural grade II/III, high-grade nuclear atypia (grade III)","Malignant, as it is a cancer with invasive properties and high-grade features",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A. ""Uterus, tubes and ovaries"" (AF1-AF2), received fresh for frozen section
diagnosis is a 398 gram, 13.5 x 11.0 x 9.0 cm hysterectomy specimen with
attached cervix (5.0 x 3.0 cm). The specimen was opened by the surgeon. The
serosal surface is markedly distorted by multiple subserosal and myometrial
leiomyomata, but otherwise grossly unremarkable. Opening the specimen
demonstrates a cervical canal (2.5 cm in length x 1.5 cm in diameter) which is
white-tan and has a herringbone pattern. The endometrial canal (7.5 cm in
length x 5.5 cm from cornu to cornu) is markedly distorted by large,
calcified, submucosal leiomyomas, the largest of which (5.0 x 4.6 x 4.2 cm) is
located in the anterior myometrium. Two other large, submucosal leiomyomas
are located in the posterior myometrium and measure 4.5 x 3.8 x 3.2 cm and 3.0
x 3.0 x 1.9 cm. All leiomyomas are calcified. The endometrium demonstrates
red-tan, hyperplastic mucosa with a fungating lesion located primarily on the
anterior side (4.5 x 3.5 cm). A photograph is taken. This fungating mass
is 0.9 cm of the anterior lower uterine segment. This area overlies the
largest calcified leiomyoma and for this reason we will not be able to obtain
full thickness sections in this area.
The right fallopian tube is 6.0 cm in length x 0.5 cm in diameter and upon
sectioning grossly unremarkable. The right ovary (2.0 x 1.1 x 0.6 cm) is
white-tan, cerebriform and grossly unremarkable. The left fallopian tube (6.7
cm in length x 0.5 cm in diameter) is upon sectioning grossly unremarkable.
The left ovary (1.2 x 1.1 x 0.4 cm) is white-tan, cerebriform and grossly
unremarkable.

Addendum Comment
Immunostains of the endometriat adenocarcinoms show an abnormal expression pattern, with loss of expression of
MLH1 and PMS2 in the tumor, with preserved expression of MSH2 and MSH6.
These antibodies are directed against the DNA mismatch repair enzymes MLH1 ,MSH2 ,PMS2 ,and MSH6. These
targets are expressed In normal cede. When expression is lost, the result is often micro -saleWta Instability. Thus, one
may Immunostain for these mismatch repair enzymes ,as a surrogate for MSI testing. In cases where the
immunostains show a normal pattern of expression ,MSI Is very unlikely .One can then reasonably skip the more
expensive and time consuming process of MSI analysis in such cases .In contrast, tumors such as the current case,
with loss of expression of one or more of these proteins ,are dkey to manifest MSI.
In this case ,tissue will be sent for condrnetory PCR testing for MSI.

MethodTUMOR MICROSATELLITE INSTABILITY
A PCR based assay is used to test for tumor microsatellite instability (MSI) with the use of 5 mononucleotide
repeat markers (BAT25 ,BAT26, Mono27 ,NR24 ,and NR21 ).The tumor tissue is classified as MSS/MSI-L
(instability detected in 0 or I out of S markers), or MSI -H (instability in 2 or more of 5 markers tested).
Results
Tumor type: endometrial adenocarcinoma MSI: MSI -H (instability observed in 3 of 3 informative markers)
Interpretation
High levels of microsatellite instability (MSI-H) are indicative of defective DNA mismatch repair function.
These results increase the is that this individual has an inherited colon cancer syndrome due to defective
DNA mismatch repair (HNPCC). However ,MSI testing does not distinguish between a somatic and a
gennline defect in one of the DNA mismatch repair genes, nor does it provide information as to which gene
might be involved .The use of immunohistochemistry ,followed by germline mutational analysis ,can further
evaluate the possibility of HNPCC in this individual.
Genetic counseling is suggested prior to proceeding with genetic testing to discuss the risks and benefits of
testing with this individual.
CAUTIONS: Test results should be interpreted in context of clinical findings ,family history ,and other
laboratory data .If results obtained do not match other clinical or laboratory findings, please contact the
sag. 4 or s

Microscopic Description and Comment:
Most of the tumor is exophytic .The tumor cells in the hysterectomy form glands and some solid areas .The tumor cells
have a high nucleadcytoplasmic ratio and nuclear hyperchromesia .Immunosleins show that the tumor cells are
diffusely positive for p16 (some areas with patchy ) and p53 (some areas weak). ER is weakly and diffusely expressed
in tumors and PR is only locally expressed In tumor calls . This Immunoprofile Is consistent with mixed serous and
endometrioid carcinoma .Some tumor cells have hybrid features .We re -reviewed this patients previous material

Page : 2 of 4 Printed from T5 x 1.5 cm. Each fragment shows a linear scar running along its length .Serial sectioning reveals firm fibrotic (issue
in the region of the scar. No grossly ident ifiable lesions are seen ,Representative sections from each of these
fragments are submitted. Labeled Al and A2. Jar 1.
The second container is labeled 'uterus ,cervix ,and bilateral tubes and ovaries .""It contains a uterus with attached
cervix and bilateral attached adnexas weighing 133 grams .The uterine corpus measures 8.5 cm from top to bottom,
5.5 cm from cornu to comu, and 4 .0 cm anterior -posterior .Multiple nodular masses are seen In subserosal location.
The ectocervix is grossly unremarkable ,tan-pink and shows small petechial hemorrhages .The os is probe patent. The
specimen is bivalved to reveal an exophytic lesion in the anterior wndometrtal cavity .This lesion measures 2.5 x 1.0
cm. Sectioning reveals the extent of this lesion to be superficial and confined to the andometrium .A wall thickness is
difficult to determine as it is distorted by the presence of multiple myomes ,the largest of which measures 4.0 x 3.5 x
3.5 cm .The right ovary measures 1.3 cm in greatest dimension and is unremarkable, atrophic .The right fallopian tube
is pinned out like a string and has an average diameter of 0.3 cm and a length o14.0 cm .The left fallopian tube is
similarly pinned out like a string and has an average diameter of 0.2 cm except in the region of the fimbria where its
appearance is more unremarkable. The left ovary measures 1.2 cm In greatest dimension and is grossly atrophic and
unremarkable .Labeled 81- anterior cervix :82 - posterior cervix: 83 to 87 - exophytic lesion from the anterior
endomyomelrium ;B8 - posterior myometrium (single full thickness section bisected );B9 to 812 - remainder of

COMMENT:
Immunohistochemlcal staining for vimentin and cytokeratln ,CAM 5.2, support the above diagnosis. The metastatic.
tumor Is mainly composed of sarcomatous component of the malignant mixed mullerian tumor. Selected slide of this
case was also reviewed by Dr . ,who concurs with the above diagnosis .This endometrial cancer
represent a malignant mixed mullartan tumor ,FIGO stage 3C. Peritoneal cytology Is negative.

Justification: Although there is no direct mention of laterality for the primary tumor, the report describes tumors found in various lymph nodes and structures on the right side, suggesting that the primary tumor is likely located on the right side of the uterus.

Histology: Carcinosarcoma (malignant mixed mesodermal tumor)
Justification: The report clearly states that the tumor is a carcinosarcoma, which is a type of malignant mixed mesodermal tumor.

Stage: III C
Justification: The patient has been assigned FIGO stage 3C based on the extent of the tumor and lymph node involvement. This stage indicates that the tumor has extended beyond the uterus, with positive pelvic or para-aortic lymph nodes.

Grade: Poorly differentiated (FIGO grade 3)
Justification: The report mentions a FIGO grade of 3, which corresponds to poorly differentiated tumors.

Behavior: Malignant
Justification: This is an inherent characteristic of carcinosarcomas, as they are by definition malignant tumors.",Carcinosarcoma (malignant mixed mesodermal tumor),III C,Poorly differentiated (FIGO grade 3),Malignant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
1.The specimen is received fresh for frozen section labeled ""uterus,
cervix, tubes and ovaries'. It consists of a markedly distorted globular
uterus with adnexa weighing 564 g and measuring 12 cm from fundus to
cervical os, 8.5 cm from cornu to cornu, and 8.5 cm in anterior posterior.
The serosal surface is smooth, tan-pink, and glistening. The cervical os
is slit-like and patulous measuring 0.8 cm. The ectocervix is smooth and
tan-gray measuring 2 x 2 cm. On opening, the endocervical canal is
unremarkable. The endometrial cavity measures 7 cm in length and 7 cm
across. The endometrium is tan-pink and focally nodular throughout the
endometriul cavity measuring up to 0.7 cm in thickness. No apparent
invasion or dominant mass is seen. In the fundus a 2.5 x 1.5 x 0.4 cm
polypoid soft lesion is identified. In the posterior uterine wall there is
9 x 7 x 7 cm firm calcified intramural nodule located as superficial as 0.3
cm from the surface of the endometrium, serial sectioning through the
nodule reveals gray soft to rubbery homogeneous center and firm calcified
edge measuring up to 0..7 cm in thickness. The anterior myometriurn is
tan-pink and trabecular, and measures 2.5 cm in thickness, the posterior
myometrium measures up to 7.5 cm in thickness. Multiple small well
circumscribed firm nodules with white whorled cut surfaces arepresent in
the myome.trium measuring up to 1.2 cm in greatest dimension. The adnexa
are attached and are grossly unremarkable. The right and left fallopian
tubes measure 5 and 6.5 cm in length, respectively. The right and left
ovaries measure 3 x 2.3 x 2.1 cm and 2.1 x 1.7 x 1.4 cm, respectively.
There are several hemorrhagic corpus luteal cysts at the periphery of the

Laterality: Not provided (as this refers to the side of the body and is not relevant for a uterine tumor)
Histology: Calcified intramural nodule in the posterior uterine wall, multiple small white nodules in the myometrium
Stage: Not provided (as staging usually requires additional clinical information such as lymph node involvement and spread of disease, which is not given in this description)
Grade: Not provided (as this typically refers to the differentiation of cancer cells, and the description does not indicate that this is a malignant tumor)

3. ""Histology"": Leiomyosarcoma, Benign endocervical polyp, Simple hyperplasia without atypia in a background of disordered proliferative endometrium, Leiomyomata. Justification: The report described these histologies for the specimens.
4. ""Stage"": Not provided. Justification: The report did not mention any staging information.
5. ""Grade"": Low grade for the leiomyosarcoma. Justification: The report mentioned that the leiomyosarcoma shows moderate cellularity with an average of 5 mitoses/10 high power fields and no nuclear pleomorphism or necrosis, which suggests a low grade.
6. ""Behavior"": Malignant for the leiomyosarcoma, Benign for others. Justification: The report mentioned that the leiomyosarcoma infiltrates into the subserosa of the small bowel and has one metastasis among 15 tumors with similar histologic features, indicating malignant behavior. Other specimens were described as benign.","['Leiomyosarcoma', 'Benign endocervical polyp', 'Simple hyperplasia without atypia in a background of disordered proliferative endometrium', 'Leiomyomata']",,['Low grade'],"['Malignant', 'Benign', 'Benign', 'Benign', 'Benign']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

G. UTERUS AND CERVIX - (FROZEN)
Labeled with the patient 's name ,labeled received fresh for intraoperative frozensection consultation ,and subsequently fixed in formalin is a 96.6 gram total abdominal hysterectomy
specimen without adnexa. The uterus is about 9.0 x 5.5 x 3.5 cm. The cervical portion of the uterus is
about 3.8 x 3.0 x 3.0 cm. The endometrial cavity is approximately 4.0 cm wide and 3.5 cm in length. Themuscular uterine wall ranges from 1 .2 to 1.5 cm .The right parametrial tissue is 2.0 x 1.2 x 0.5 cm, the left
parametral tissue is 1.3 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm, and a small portion of anterior paracervical tissue is 1.3 x 1.0 x
0.5 cm. The anterior vaginal cuff is 3.5 cm x 1.3 x 0.3 cm. The rim of posterior vaginal cuff is 0.8 x 0.2 x0.2 cm. The cervical os is approximately 0.3 cm.
Thereis a tan soft to firm uterine tumor that involves a 4.2 x 4.0 cm area of the endometrium in thefundus and uterine corpus (posterior > anterior )and extends into the lower uterine segment ,but not into the cervix .Myometrial invasion is present ,up to 1.5 cm into a 1 .5 cm wall. The tumor focally penetrates
the uterine serosa and abuts the uterine serosa elsewhere. The parametrial tissues and vaginal cuff aregrossly free of tumor.
The endocervical mucosa in the transformation zone appears irregular,fibrotic ,and ulcerated. No distinct mass or invasive tumor is seen . The ectocervicalmucosa shows patchy areas of ero sion and /or defects, including a 0.7 x 0 .6 cm oval lesion in the 6 :00-9:00 quadrant. No invasive tumor is evident on gross
inspection of the cervix. The cervix also shows several mucus-filled cysts, the largest of which is about
0.3 cm in diameter. The vaginal cuff is grossly unremarkable. There is very little grossly uninvolved
endometrium, that is up to 0.1 cm in thickness. There are foci of hemorrhage in the endometrium and
superficial myometrium. There is a 0.3 cm diameter leiomyoma composed of firm tan solid tissue in thelower uterine segment .No areas of necrosis or hemorrhage are seen in the leiomyoma.A few uterine serosal adhesions are also present.
Gross photographs are obtained.

Intraoperative Consultation
A.Complex hyperplasia with atypia. No definite evidence of an
invasive process. Adenomyosis also present. Gross Description
A.Received fresh labeled ""uterus, cervix, both tubes and ovaries"" is a
142 g, 7.0 x 6.2 x 4.7 cm symmetrical uterine corpus with attached 3.8
cm cervix and bilateral adnexa. The serosa is smooth tan-pink. The
annular 3.5 cm tan-white ectocervix surrounds a 1.0 x 0.2 cm ovoid
patent os. Endocervical mucosa is mildly trabecular tan-pink. The
distorted, 4.2 x 2.7 cm uterine cavity is lined by markedly soft pale
tan endometrium/tumor. A frozen section is performed. On sectioning,
the lesion has an apparent maximal thickness of 0.8 cm, involving the
upper one 3rd of the myometrium anteriorly. The myometrium is markedly
trabecular tan-pink and measures up to 2.5 cm. A few rubbery tan-white
intramural leiomyomata measuring up to 1.7 cm are present.
Bilaterally, the rubbery tan-pink ovaries average 2.4 x 2.0 x 1.6 cm.
On sectioning, the stroma both ovaries is pale tan with identifiable
corpora albicantia. The markedly convoluted right and left fallopian
tubes are adhesed and appear to be to measure approximately 5 cm in
length and range from 0.4 to 0.8 cm in diameter. The lumina appear
pinpoint.
Summary: 1 and 2 - anterior cervix/Lus, continuity inked blue, 3
through 7 - representative anterior endomyometrium, fundus to Lus
including identifiable tumor, 8 and 9 - posterior cervix/lower uterine
segment, continuity inked black, 10 through 13 - posterior
endomyometrium, fundus to Lus, 14 - leiomyomata, 15 - right adnexa, 16
17 - left adnexa
B.Received fresh and subsequently fixed in formalin labeled ""hernia
sac"" is a 4.3 x 4.3 x 0.5 cm aggregate of pink-tan fibromembranous
tissue and yellow lobular fat. RS 1.

and less solid areas are positive for estrogen and progesterone receptor. Vimentin Is largely negative with only focal
positive staining .Despite the primarily endocervical location ,except for the positive CEA, these results are more
consistent with an endometrial primary .Note that about 15% of endometrial primary tumors are CEA positive .In situ

The specimens are received in nine tormalln -filled containers labeled with the patients name The first
container is further labeled' uterus, cervix ,bilateral tubes and ovaries .-It contains a uterus and cervix with attached
bilateral ovaries and fallopian tubes weighing 308 grams post fixation .The uterus and cervix measure 11.3 cm from
fondue to tip of cervix x 7.5 cm from comu to comu x 6.5 cm from anterior to posterior .The serosal surface Is tan-pink
to purple and without lesions .There is a probable subserosal leiomyoma measuring 1.8 cm In diameter .It is well
circumscribed and has a tan-gray whorled cut surface. The cervix measures 3.8 x 5 x 5 cm. The pericervloal soft tissue
resection margin has been previously inked In black .There is a scant amount of parametrlal soft tissue measuring 2.5
x 2.0 x 0 .3 cm on the right and 2 .0 x 1.0 x 0.2 cm on the left. The tan-pink ectocervix has been previously incised. It
roughly measures 5.0 x 3 .7 cm. There Is a portion of vaginal cuff anteriorly measuring 4 x 0.5 cm. There is also a
portion of vaginal cuff located along the posterior cervix measuring 3.0 x 0 .8 cm. The cervical and vaginal mucose is
without lesions except for a few petechial hemorrhages noted on the ectocervix posteriorly. The external os measures
-1.3 x 0 .7 cm. Tan to maroon hemorrhagic tissue is seen within the os. The uterus and cervix have been previously
opened to reveal a polypold tumor mass located within the upper endocervical canal. The point of attachment Is within
the upper two -thirds of the endocervical canal. The tumor measures 4.9 x 2 .6 x 3.0 cm .Sectioning through the tumor
reveals a tan-pink cut surface .The tumor appears to invade into the wall of the cervix .The maximal depth of Invasion
appears to be 1.2 cm where the total cervical wall thickness measures 1.4 cm .This deepest point of Invasion Is located
within the anterior cervix at approximately the 12 o 'clock position .The tumor appears to No 0 .2 cm from the
paraeervieal soft tissue resection margin and 1 .2 cm away from the vaginal cuff margin where It most closely
approaches deep margin .There are also some polypoid excrescences noted more Inferior to this main tumor mass
within the endocervical canal .They measure ,in aggregate, 0.7 x 0 .5 x 0.15 cm. This smaller mass appears rather
superficial and is located 1.0 cm from the external os. The endometrial cavity measures 3.7 x 3 .2 cm. The endometrial
mucosa appears thickened and contains polypoid tumor in both the antenor and posterior endometrial wall. The
maximal endometrial thickness measures 0.5 cm. The depth of myometriel Invasion appears to be 1 mm where the
total myometrial wall thickness measures 2.2 cm .Within the myometrtum, there are multiple probable Ieiomyomas with
circumscribed borders and tan-pink to white whorled cut surfaces .They range In size from 0 .7 to 1.7 cm In diameter,
The right ovary measures 3.5 x 1.3 x 1.3 cm ,The serosal surface Is tan to purple and unremarkable .Sectioning
reveals a tan-white to gray variegated cut surface with a yellow -orange corpus luteum .The right fallopian tube has
been previously cut and measures 5.0 cm in length with a diameter ranging from 0.3 to 0.9 cm. The serosal surface Is
pink to purple and contain a few subserosal cysts ranging in size from 0.1 to 0.6 cm In greatest dimension .Sectioning
reveals a pinpoint lumen with a well thickness measuring 0.2 cm .The left ovary measures 3.9 x 2 .0 x 1.8 cm. The
serosal surface is tan -pink to purple and unremarkable .Sectioning reveals a tan-gray to purple variegated cut surface
with yellow -orange corpora lutes. There is one hemorrhagic focus measuring 0.9 x 1.1 x 0.5 cm. The left fallopian tube
measures 6.3 cm In length with a diameter ranging from 0 .3 to 0.9 cm. The serosal surface Is purple to gray with a few

CLINICAL INFORMATION:
Pelvic mass uterine cancer. Exploratory laparotomy, total abdominal
hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, lymph node dissection,
extensive lysis of adhesion, omentectomy.
GROSS DESCRIPTION:
1.Thespecimen is received fresh for intraoperative consultation and
labeled uterus, cervix, tubes and ovaries. It consists of a 589 g, markedly
distorted hysterectomy specimen with attached bilateral adnexa. The uterus
measures 15.5cm from fundus to ectocervix, 10.Ocm from cornu to cornu, and
8.5cm from anterior to posterior. The cervix is surfaced by a 2.5 x 2.2cm
portion of tan-white glistening mucosa.The cervix exhibits a 0.5cm
slitlike, probe patent os. The uterine serosa is tan-pink to red purple,
smooth and glistening to focally shaggy. The anterior aspect of the serosa
is inked in blue and the posterior aspect inked in black. The uterus is
bivalved into anterior and posterior halves to reveal a 5.0 x 4.0 x 2.5cm
tan-gray to tan-brown, exophytic massidentified in the endometrial cavity.
The mass is located in the anterior and posterior fundus and focally
extends to within 6.5cm of the cervical os, on the posterior aspect. The
mass is located predominately in the fundic aspect of the endometrial
cavity; however the massapproaches the posterior lower uterine segment.
Cut section of the mass reveals a variegated, tan-gray to red-brown, soft
cut surface. The mass extends into the myometrium, predominantly in the
posterior fundus. The mass focally extends to within 0.2cm of the posterior
uterine serosa. The tumor is diffusely softened with areas of apparent
necrosis. The remainder of the endometrial cavity, which measures 8.0cm in
length and 4.Ocm across, exhibits tan-red, glistening endometrium,
averaging 0.2cm in thickness. The myometrium is tan-pink and trabecular,
ranging from 1.0cm up to 3.5cm in thickness. Also identified in the
anterior fundus is a 1.0cm in greatest dimension ovoid, tan-white, rubbery
intramural nodule. The nodule exhibits a tan-white to tan-yellow whorled,
rubbery cut surface. The endocervical canal is tan-white, trabeculated and
measures 2.5cm in length. The attached right ovary is tan-yellow,
bosselated and measures 3,0 x 2.5 x 1.5cm. The ovary is sectioned to reveal
a 1.3cm hemorrhagic, corpus luteum and several tan-white, corpora
albicantia ranging up to 0.5 cm. The remainder of the cut surface consists
of tan-pink ovarian stroma. The attached right fallopian tube is difficult
to identify grossly, however adjacent to the right ovary is a 3.0 x 0.8cm
red- purple tubular structure. The structure exhibits an apparent lumen on

measures 2.0 x 1.5 x 1.2cm. The ovary is sectioned to reveal several
tan-white corpora albicantia, ranging up to 0.3cm in greatest dimension.
The remainder of the cut surface consists of tan-pink ovarian stroma. The
attached left fallopian tube measures 4.Ocm in length, ranges from 0.5cm up
to 0.8cm in diameter and exhibits a fimbriated end. The tube exhibits a
smooth glistening serosa and a pinpoint lumen on cut section.
Representative sections of the aforementioned mass are submitted for frozen

Comment:
Sections of the smooth muscle tumor in the myometrium show a
proliferation of pleomorphic spindle cells showing marked
cellular pleomorphism, significantly increased mitotic activity
(>10 mitoses per 10 high power fields counted), and tumor
necrosis. In addition, the tumor is frankly infiltrative (e.g.
A2) and lymphovascular space invasion is also present (e.g.
A10). Immunohistochemical evaluation performed on the previous
endometrial biopsy ( .supports classification as a leiomyosarcoma. No carcinoma component is identified to qualify
for a carcinosarcoma.
Clinical History:
-year-old female with a pelvic mass.
Gross Description:
Received is one appropriately labeled container, additionally
labeled ""uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries."" It holds
a 690 gram, 12.3 x 8.3 x 7.2 cm uterus with attached bilateral
adnexa. The serosa is dark gray and smooth. The 3.0 x 2.5 cm
ectocervix has a 0.6 cm patent as. The 2.7 cm long endocervical
canal is tan and trabeculated. Within the endometrial cavity
there is a 10.0 x 9.5 x 4.5 cm tan soft, somewhat nodular mass
with central yellow soft areas. The mass appears to originate
from the myometrium. The uninvolved myometrium is tan, firm and
up to 3.5 cm thick. The endometrium is tan-yellow and ranges in
thickness from 0.3 to 0.6 cm. There is a 2.5 x 2.0 x 0.6 cm
polyp attached to the anterior endometrium. On section, the
polyp appears to be contained to the endometrial surface.
The right ovary is 3.8 x 1.9 x 1.0 cm. The outer surface is tan
and smooth. On section, the cut surface is grossly unremarkable.
The attached fimbriated fallopian tube is 4.0 cm in length x 0.4
cm in diameter. Along the outer surface there are several
translucent fluid-filled cysts up to 0.6 cm. The remainder of
the outer surface is dark red and smooth. On sectioning, the
lumen appears patent.
The left ovary is 2.8 x 1.5 x 1.2 cm. The outer surface is tan
and smooth. On section, the cut surface is tan/yellow, firm and
unremarkable. The attached fimbriated fallopian tube is roughly
4.1 cm in length x 0.6 cm in diameter. Along the length of the
tube there are multiple translucent cloudy fluid-filled cysts up
to 0.4 cm. The remainder of the outer surface is dark brown and
smooth. On section, the lumen appears patent.

COMMENT
The tumors in the uterus/cervix and bilateral ovaries show similar morphology. Tumor infiltrates through the entire full-thickness
of the myometrium as well as the ovaries, therefore it is difficult to establish the primary site, although an endometrial primary isfavored.

Gross Description
1. The specimen is labeled with the patient's name and as ""hysterectomy BSO"". It consists of a
uterus with bilateral adnexa weighing 221 g. The uterus measures 9.2SI x 6.6ML x 4.1 AP cm and
the cervix measures 3.1 cm in diameter. The slit os measures 0.3cm long. The right fallopian tube
measures 6x0.7 cm and the right ovary is not well defined. The left fallopian tube measures
6x0.8cm and the left ovary 3.1 x2.4x1.6cm.
The serosal surface of the uterus shows hemorrhagic adhesions.A tumor is present
predominantly in the left fundus extending into the myometrium. There are central areas of
necrosis. It is forming a mass and measures 2.1 SI x 3.3 ML x 3.8 AP cm. The posterior lower
endomyometrium shows a friable papillary lesion measuring 2.8 SI x 1.4 ML x 1.3 APcm. Grossly
the lesion does not reach the lower uterine segment. A large intramural fibroid with whorllike
appearance also identified measuring 3.5 cm in diameter. The exocervix is smooth and shows
nabothian cysts. The right fallopian tube shows hemorrhagic adhesions on the outer surface but
is patent on sectioning. The right fallopian tube is ill-defined but the area is somewhat
hemorrhagic with membraneous tissue. The left fallopian tube also shows hemorrhagic
adhesions on the surface and patent on sectioning. Hemorrhagic adhesions identified on the tan-
white surface of the left ovary. Translucent follicular cyst also seen at the surface. On sectioning
corpus luteum is identified measuring 0.6 cm in diameter.

circumferences
the 4.2 x 3.8 cm. dusky tan-pink-red ectocervix. The patent os
measures 1 x 0.3 cm. The anterior paracervical surface is inked
blue and the posterior paracervical surface is inked black. On
opening, the cervical canal contains soft tan-white tumor, which
extends into and filled the distorted 4 x 2.5 cm. endometrial
cavity. Sectioning through the cervix and lower uterine segment
reveals glistening tan-white tumor, which measures up to 2 cm. in
thickness and extends to within 0.2 cm. of the inked paracervical
surface. The tumor throughout the endometrial cavity measures up
to
2.2 cm. in thickness, involving greater than 75% of the myometrium
grossly. The myometrium is tan-pink and measures up to 2 cm. in
thickness. The 2.4 x 2.2 x 1.6 cm., rubbery tan-gold left ovary
shows pale tan stroma on sectioning by identifiable corpora
albicantia. The discontinuous-appearing fimbriated pink-purple
left
fallopian tube measures 5.5 cm. in length and averages 0.5 cm. in
diameter, with a pinpoint to stellate lumen on sectioning.

Labeled with the patient 's name ,labeled ""uterus /cervix /right tube and ovary /left tube and ovary"", and
received fresh from the operating room is a 150 gram specimen consisting of a previously opened uterus
with attached fallopian tubes and ovaries. The uterus measures 7.0 x 7.0 x 5.0 cm. The exocervix
measures 4.0 x 3.0 cm. The endocervical canal measures 4.0 cm in length and 0.6 cm in diameter. The
endometrial cavity measures 3.0 cm in length and 3.4 cm in width. The right ovary measures 3.0 x 1.2 x
0.4 cm and the right fallopian tube measures 3.6 cm in length and 0.3 cm in diameter. There is a 2.5 x
2.5 x 2.0 cm right paratubal cyst. The left ovary measures 2.0 x 1.3 x 0.8 cm and the left fallopian tube
measures 3.2 cm in length and 0.2 cm in diameter.
The endometrial cavity is largely replaced by a friable, red/tan, heaped up 3.0 x 3.0 cm mass which
extends from the fundus to the lower uterine segment on both the anterior and posterior surfaces. The
cut surface reveals invasion into the underlying superficial myometrium. A representative section has
been used for frozen section. The myometrium measures 1.5 cm in thickness and contains multiple,
approximately five to seven nodules located submucosal,intramural ,and subserosal . They range from
1.0 to 3 .0 cm in greatest dimension. Cut surface of all nodules reveal white fibrous,often whorled surface
and firm texture without hemorrhage or necrosis.
The exocervix, external os and endocervical canal are grossly unremarkable. The uninvolved portion of
the endometrial cavity is covered by tan /pink hemorrhagic mucosal surface without additional gross
lesions. The serosa shows no gross abnormalities.
Representative sections are submitted.

adenocarcinoma. Resection margins are negative.
Left ovary with endometriotic cysts ; negative for carcinoma.
Left fallopian tube with hydrosalpinx; negative for carcinoma.
C. Omentum, omentectomy:
Fibroadipose tissue negative for carcinoma.
D. Para -aortic lymph nodes, regional resection:
SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT
FINAL
Two lymph nodes negative for carcinoma (0/2).
E. Right obturator nodes, regional resection:
Two lymph nodes negative for carcinoma (0/2).
F. Left iliac node ,excisional biopsy:
One lymph node negative for carcinoma.
COMMENT:
Given the presence of tumor in both the endometrium and ovary , it is not clear if
synchronous primaries are present
versus an endometrial primary. If synchronous tumors are clinically favored, then the
ovarian tumor is staged as
pT1 cNOM0 and the uterine tumor is staged as T2NOMO. However , if an endometrial
primary is clinically favored,
then the tumor is staged as T3aNOMO based on the presence of ovarian involvement.

Gross Description
The specimen is received in 7 parts:
A. The specimen is received fresh labeled ""UTERUS, TUBES, OVARIES, CERVIX"" and consists of a 195 g distorted uterus with
attached cervix and bilateral adnexa, 8.5 cm from anterior to posterior, 8 cm from fundus to ectocervix, and 7.5 cm from cornu to
cornu. The serosa is tan-pink, smooth and glistening. The ectocervical mucosa is tan-pink, smooth and glistening, 4.8 cm in diameter
which surrounds a 1 cm slitlike os. The serosa on the anterior surface is inked red and the serosa on the posterior surface is inked
black. The endocervical canal is tan, glistening striated. Within the endometrial cavity and displacing the endometrium entirely, is a 7
x 4.5 x 1.5 cm tan, friable, polypoid mass. No uninvolved endometrium is grossly identified. This mass comes to within 3.5 cm from
the anterior endo-ectocervical junction and 4 cm from the posterior endo-ectocervical junction, 1.8 cm from the anterior serosal
surface and 0.5 cm from the posterior serosal surface. Sectioning beneath this mass on the anterior aspect reveals no gross invasion
into the myometrium, but on the posterior aspect, grossly extends to within 0.5 cm of the serosa. There are also approximately 5
intramural and subserosal, tan-white, bulging, whorled, well-circumscribed nodules ranging from 0.5-5 cm in greatest dimension. No
areas of hemorrhage or necrosis are identified.
The left adnexal unit consists of 4.3 x 2 x 1.5 cm ovary and a fimbriated fallopian tube, 5.8 cm in length and 0.7 cm in diameter. The
right adnexal unit consists of a 3.5 x 2 x 1 cm ovary and a fimbriated fallopian tube 5.5 cm in length and 0.7 cm in diameter. A central
portion of each fallopian tube is missing. The outer surfaces of the ovaries are tan pink and cerebriform. Sectioning reveals
unremarkable cut surfaces. The serosa of the fallopian tubes is grey purple, smooth and glistening. Sectioning reveals patent, pinpoint
lumens. Rep. sections are submitted as follows;

The endometrial adenocarcinoma is estrogen receptor positive (2-3+, 90%) andprogesterone receptor positive (3+, 90%)
by immunohistochemistry .Controls stained appropriately.
The focus of localized leiomyomatosis noted in a left pelvic lymph node (slide C10 )is confirmed by positive
immunostaining for HMB45 .Localized leiomyomatosis is a rare entity, and may be associated with disease in other
sites,particularly pulmonary leiomyomatosis. As clinically indicated ,consider further evaluation for potential pulmonary
involvement.

C. UTERUS WITH CERVIX FOR FROZEN SECTION WITH LEFT TUBE AND OVARY
Labeled with the patient's name designated ""uterus with cervix for frozen section with left
tube and ovary"", and received fresh for intraoperative gross evaluation and subsequently fixed in formalin
is a 650 gram intact total hysterectomy and left salpingo-oophorectomy specimen. The uterus is about
14.5 x 10.0 x 9.0 cm. The cervical portion of the uterus is 2.3 cm long and up to 3.5 cm in diameter. The
endometrial cavity is 4.5 cm long and up to 1.3 cm in width. The endometrial mucosa is up to 0.1 cm in
thickness. The muscular uterine wall ranges from 1.5 to 2.5 cm, No vaginal cuff or parametrial tissues
are present. The left ovary is about 2.3 x 1.1 x 0.8 cm. The fimbriated left fallopian tube is 5.8 cm long,
ranges from 0.3 to 0.4 cm in diameter, and has a maximum luminal diameter of 0.1 cm.
There is a poorly delineated, heterogenous tumor that diffusely involves the myometrium from the lower
uterine segment to the fundus in the anterior and posterior segments. The tumor is estimated to be about
13.5 x 9.5 x 9.0 cm in greatest overall dimensions. In the lower uterine segment , the tumor is tan, semi-
firm, has a whorled configuration and appears viable. Tan-yellow semi-soft areas that may be necrotic are
present in the portion of the tumor in left lateral uterine corpus. The remainder of the tumor is soft, tan,
and focally hemorrhagic, and shows additional areas of possible necrosis. No gross tumor is seen in the
endometrium or cervix. The tumor protrudes from the left anterolateral serosal surface as a
pseudopolypoid 2.5 x 2.3 x 0.9 cm yellow mass, but elsewhere is confined to the uterine wall. The
uterine serosa on the left lateral surface is indented, fibrotic, and irregular. The left adnexal structures are
adherent to the uterus in the vicinity of tumor and the ovary may be secondarily involved. No gross tumor
is seen in the fallopian tube.
No gross pathologic lesions of the endometrium are seen. The cervix is remarkable only for several
mucus-filled cysts, the largest of which is about 0.2 cm in diameter. The ovary also shows atrophic
changes. No gross pathologic lesions of the fallopian tube (proper) are identified.
Photographs of the specimen are obtained.

Microscopic Description:
A microscopic exam was performed."," Site: Uterus
Justification: The report mentions ""endometrioid adenocarcinoma"" which is a type of cancer that starts in the endometrium, the lining of the uterus.

Laterality: Not provided
Justification: The report does not mention any laterality as the cancer is present in the uterus and there are no mentions of any other location.

Histology: Endometrioid adenocarcinoma
Justification: The report clearly states ""endometrioid adenocarcinoma"" which is a specific type of cancer that starts in glandular cells that line the inside of an organ.

Stage: pT1a IA
Justification: The report mentions ""pT1a IA"" which refers to the pathologic staging of endometrial cancers. Here, pT1a indicates that the tumor is limited to the endometrium or invades less than one-half of the myometrium and pN0 means there are no regional lymph node metastases.

Grade: FIGO grade 3
Justification: The report mentions ""FIGO grade 3"" which refers to the degree of differentiation of the cancer cells, with higher grades indicating less differentiated cells.

Behavior: Malignant
Justification: Endometrioid adenocarcinoma is a type of malignant tumor, meaning it can invade surrounding tissues and spread to other parts of the body.",Endometrioid adenocarcinoma,pT1a IA,FIGO grade 3,Malignant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GROSS EXAMINATION:
A. ""Left tube and ovary, uterus, cervix"", received fresh for frozen section is
a 223 gram, 7.4 x 5.7 x 4.8 cm uterus with attached adnexa. Opening the
uterus reveals a 3.1 x 2.1 cm fungating, firm, friable tumor of the posterior
endometrium. Sectioning through the tumor reveals a tumor depth of 1.1 cm.
The remainder of the uterus is distorted with multiple subserosal, submucosal,
and intramural nodules that are firm, well encapsulated, and have a whorled,
tan-white cut surface. The largest of the these is 3.6 cm in greatest
diameter and has focal calcifications.
The endometrial cavity is 4.1 x 3.6 cm with an uninvolved endometrial
thickness of 0.1 cm. The myometrium is 2.4 cm thick. The endocervical canal
is 1.6 cm long and the squamocolumnar junction is distinct. The diameter of
the cervix is 4.8 cm and the os is 0.4 cm.
The left adnexa consists of a 2.3 x 1.8 x 1.5 cm firm, tan-white, cerebriform
ovary with attached grossly unremarkable mesentery and fat. The attached
fimbriated fallopian tube is 4.6 cm and ranges in diameter from 0.6 to 0.9
cm. There is a 0.9 x 0.8 x 0.8 cm smooth paratubal cyst filled with a clear
serous fluid.
The right adnexa consists of a 2.2 cm long and 0.9 cm in diameter segment of
fallopian tube. No fimbria and no ovary are identified. Sectioning reveals
grossly unremarkable parenchyma.
A representative section of the endometrial tumor was previously frozen as AF1
and the frozen section remnant is submitted in block Al. A representative
section of para-ovarian tissue was previously frozen as AF2 and the frozen
remnant is submitted in block A2.

COMMENT: The grading of this endometrioid adenocarcinoma is somewhat
difficult. By gland/solid percentage area, this is a grade 2 tumor, but there are areas of very poorly-differentiated growth with marked nuclear atypia,
making this a grade 3 carcinoma.

A. UTERUS AND RIGHT TUBE
Labeled with the patient 's name, labeled ""uterus and right tube"", and received fresh in the Operating Room for
intraoperative frozen and subsequently fixed in formalin is a 120 gram total hysterectomy specimen with attached
right adnexa and left portion of possible fallopian tube. The uterus is 9.1 x 8 .2 x 6.0 cm . The cervical portion is 3.7
cm in length and up to 2 .7 cm in width .The endometrial cavity is 5 .0 cm in length ,and up to 2 .0 cm in width. The
endometrial thickness is 1.7 cm. The myometrial thickness is 0.2 cm . The right fimbriated fallopian tube is 6.5 cm
in length ,0.5 cm in diameter . The right ovary is 4.1 x 2.5 x 0.9 cm.
Located along the left lateral wall of the anterior and posterior cavity is a poorly circumscribed exophytic tan-red
soft tumor measuring 3.6 x 3.0 cm in surface area and coming 1.2 cm above the mucosal surface . On cut surface
this tumor appears to only involve the superficial aspect and does not show any gross deep invasion . The tumor
appears to be confined to the uterine corpus and does not involve the lower uterine segment ,or the cervix grossly.
This tumor does not appear to involve the parametrial tissues as well.
The uterus is also large and distorted by several approximately five to seven well-circumscribed tan firm
leiomyomas ranging from 0.5 to 4.0 cm in greatest dimension .On cut surface the leiomyomas are located within
the majority of intramural .On cut section these nodules are tan ,firm, whorled ,homogenous without hemorrhage or
necrosis .No other gross lesions are identified within the myometrium .The serosa is remarkable for multiple
adhesions and congestion .The right fallopian tube is remarkable for external congestion but no gross tumor is seen.
The cut surface of the ovary reveals an ill-defined yellow soft suspicious area measuring 2.1 x 1.1 x 0.4 cm and
occupies approximately 50% of the parenchyma .Otherwise there are multiple corpora albicans amongst the
congested stroma.
A representative portion of tissue was submitted for frozen section analysis.

********** Addendum - Please See End of Report **********
Reason for Addendum #1: Additional sections or studies
DIAGNOSIS:
A. RIGHT OVARY AND FALLOPIAN TUBE (SALPINGO-OOPHORECTOMY):
-Benign ovary with corpora albicantia ,rare calcification ,and rare multinucleated giant cell
-Benign fallopian tube with hydrosalpinx ,small focus suggestive of endometriosis ,and serosal
adhesions with reactive mesothelial cells
B. UTERUS AND CERVIX (TOTAL HYSTERECTOMY):
-Endometrial carcinoma with endometrioid (adenosquamous )and undifferentiated features
(see comment)
-Tumor measures approximately 14.0 x 7.7 cm in surface area and replaces almost all of
the anterior and posterior endometrium
-Tumor is exophytic and invasive
-Tumor invades >50% of the myometrial thickness
-Invasive tumor extends into the lower uterine segment and upper endocervix
-Lymphvascular invasion present (contraction artefact around tumor nests also noted)
-Tumor associated necrosis with acute inflammatory cells
-Tumor associated lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate
-Rare tumor associated calcification
-Bilateral parametrial soft tissue with detached tumor fragments interpreted as floaters
-Uninvolved endometrium with deciduoid stromal change consistent with history of progestin
therapy
-Adenomyosis
-Additional findings in the cervix include nabothian cysts, squamous metaplasia, cervicitis,
and reactive cellular changes

K. OMENTUM #3 (PARTIAL OMENTECTOMY):
-Omental adipose tissue with tiny fibrous adhesions and few reactive mesothelial cells
-No tumor identified
COMMENT: The tumor exhibits glandular /poorly differentiated glandular ,squamous
(nonkeratinizing ),and undifferentiated features . The poorly differentiated endometrioid.
component shows glandular, trabecular /cord-like, and nested growth patterns and is considered
architectural grade 3 .The undifferentiated component shows solid sheets of monotonous ,small to
intermediate size cells with scant cytoplasm ,open chromatin ,and frequent mitoses. In an effort to
further characterize the tumor ,several immunostains were performed on blocks B4 and B14. Only
rare cells in the undifferentiated component stain positive for keratin AE 1/3, MOC 31, or BER-
EP4 (in contrast to the staining seen in the endometrioid component ).Stains for cytokeratin 7,
CAM 5. 2, vimentin , WTI, ER, PR, chromogranin ,and synaptophysin are negative in the
undifferentiated tumor component .Some undifferentiated tumor cells stain for p53 and a few stain
for p16 .The lymph node profiles show prominent sinus histiocytosis (virtually negative
immunostaining for epithelial markers in the undifferentiated tumor component precludes
application of these antibodies to search for occult tumor cells in the lymph nodes). Based on these
specimens ,pathologic staging is assigned as pT2b NO.

B. UTERUS WITH CERVIX
Labeled with the patient 's name ,labeled ""uterus with cervix "",and received fresh for gross consultation and
subsequently fixed in formalin is a 520 gram total hysterectomy specimen .The uterus measures 7.5 x 9.2 x 11.4cm. The cervical portion is 5.0 cm in length and up to 3 .2 cm in diameter in the ectocervical region. The
ectocervical os is 1.4 cm in diameter .The endocervical canal is 4.0 cm in length. The endometrial cavity measures8.0 cm in length and up to 7.7 cm in width .The myometrium measures up to 3.6 cm in thickness.
The anterior and posterior endometrium is almost entirely replaced by friable red -tan fungating tumor that measures14.0 x 7.7 cm in surface area and almost fills the endometrial cavity. The tumor extends into the lower uterine
segment and cervical canal in the posterior aspect and is within 1 .0 cm in the transformation zone .The tumorinvades into the superficial half of the lower uterine segment /cervix (to within 0.7 cm of the serosal surface). The
main volume of the tumor is in the endometrial cavity and shows maximum invasion of approximately two-thirds of
the uterine wall (within 1 .9 cm of the serosa at the superior most aspect of the uterus).
Within the uterus there is one well -circumscribed intramural leiomyoma measuring 2.5 x 2.2 x 1.8 cm. The cutsurface is gray -white firm and whorled without evidence of hemorrhage ,necrosis ,or calcification .The externalcervical os, the transformation zone ,and the anterior endocervical canal are grossly unremarkable. The uninvolved
mucosa is pink-tan and soft with focal pinpoint hemorrhage .The serosa is pink-tan and smooth without adhesions.The bilateral parametrial soft tissues are grossly unremarkable.

No areas of fat necrosis or corrgesfton are identified. tt: }8 x 19"," Based on the pathology report, here is the information organized into the six categories:

Site:
- Not all specimens include information about the site, but some possible sites mentioned are left and right iliac, left psoas, omentum, and tibial.

Laterality:
- Laterality refers to whether the pathology is on the left or right side of the body. The report includes specimens from both sides.

Histology:
- The histology of a specimen refers to its microscopic structure and composition. In this case, most of the specimens are made up of fibroadipose tissue, which is a mixture of fatty and connective tissue. Some specimens also include lymph nodes, which are specialized organs that help fight infection.

Stage:
- Not provided in the report.

Grade:
- Not provided in the report.

Behavior:
- The behavior of a pathology refers to whether it is benign or malignant. In this case, the report does not provide enough information to determine the behavior of the specimens.

Justification for the choice:
- I chose these categories based on their relevance to understanding the nature and significance of the pathology specimens described in the report. While some important information is missing from the report, such as the stage and grade of the pathologies, the available information still provides valuable insights into the specimens' composition and characteristics.",fibroadipose tissue and lymph nodes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gross Description
The specimen is received in 4 parts:
A. The specimen is received fresh for frozen section labeled ""UTERINE CORPUS, TUBES, OVARIES"" and consists of a 690 g,
previously opened, enlarged and distorted uterine corpus without cervix, 11 cm from fundus to the resection margin ,9 cm from cornu
to cornu and 8 cm from anterior to posterior. There are bilateral attached adnexa.The serosa is tan-pink, smooth and glistening with
approximately 8 subserosal nodules, up to 7 cm in greatest dimension. The anterior portion is inked red and the posterior portion is
inked black. Within the endometrial cavity is a 8 x 5 x 2.5 cm tan, papillary, friable mass that comes to within 5 cm from the posterior
margin of resection and 7 cm from the anterior margin of resection. The mass is 20% on the anterior aspect and 80% on the posterior
aspect. The mass involves the outer half of a 4 cm thick endoemtrium. At the deepest siteof invasion the mass measures approxmately
2.5 cm in thickness. The uninvolved endometrium is tan -pink, glistening and up to 0.2 cm thick. Within the myometrium are
approximately Sand white, firm, whorled bulging nodules, up to 3.5 cm in greatest dimension. No areas of hemorrhage or necrosis
within the nodules is identified, however the largest subserosal nodule is focally calcified.
The left adnexal unit consists of a fimbriated fallopian tube ,4.5 cm in length and 0.5 cm in diameter and ovary, 3 x 2.5 x 0. 8 cm. The
right adnexal unit consists of a fallopian tube ,5 cm in length and 0.6 cm in diameter ,and an ovary ,3 x 1.5 x 1 cm. The outer surfaces
of the ovaries aretan pink and cerebriform .Sectioning reveals variegated and unremarkable cut surfaces .The serosa of the fallopian
tubes are grey purple ,smooth and glistening .Sectioning reveals patent, pinpoint lumens, Rep. sections are submitted as follows:

-year-old female with a history of leiomyosarcoma of the endometrium.
Final Diagn osis:A.Uterus, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries, hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy:
Uterus: Leiomyosarcoma with necrosis, focally protruding through the uterine serosal surface and focally involving the
cervix. See comment.
Bilateral fallopian tubes: No diagnostic abnormalities.
Bilateral ovaries: Benign inclusion cysts. Negative for tumor.
Comment:
The sarcoma shows multiple foci of necrosis and has a high mitotic rate of greater than 40 mitoses/1 0 hpf. Foci of significant
nuclear atypia are noted. Immunostains performed demonstrate that the sarcoma is positive for desmin, caldesmon and HHF-35
and is negative for pancytokeratin, supporting the diagnosis. The MIB1 proliferative rate is high (approximately 60 - 70%). The
sarcoma invades into the myometrium.
UTERUS:
Specimen: Uterus and bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries
Procedure: Simple hysterectomy
Specimen Integrity: Intact hysterectomy specimen
Tumor Site: Posterior endomyometrium
Tumor Size: 29.5 cm in greatest dimension
Histologic Type: Leiomyosarcoma
Endocervical involvement: Present
Extent of Involvement of Other Organs: Not identified

Gross Description:
A.Received fresh labeled with the patient's name and ""uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries"" is a 3471 gram hysterectomy
specimen that measures 30.9 x 26.5 x 14.5 cm. The serosa is tan-pink and extending from the left lateral/posterior wall is a 6.5 x
4.5 cm mass that has broken through the serosal surface. The area surrounding this defect is inked black. The cervical os is
round and measures 4.5 cm. The uterus is bivalved coronally to reveal a 29.5 x 22.1 x 13.9 cm necrotic yellow-white and pink
mass located predominantly within the posterior endometrium. A 4.5 x 4.2 x 3.5 cm portion of this mass is extending through the
cervical os. Central portions of this mass are calcified.
Attached to the uterus is an 8.5 cm in length by 0.4 cm in diameter tan-pink, smooth fimbriated left fallopian tube that is serially
sectioned to reveal an unremarkable pinpoint lumen. Adjacent to the left fallopian tube is a 2.1 x 2.0 x 0.6 cm lobular tan-pink left
ovary that is bivalved to reveal a variegated tan-pink cut surface.
Also attached to the uterus is a 7.5 cm in length by 0.6 cm in diameter tan-pink fimbriated right fallopian tube that is serially
sectioned to reveal an unremarkable pinpoint lumen. There is a 1.0 x 0.6 x 0.6 cm smooth walled cyst within the fallopian tube
that is serially sectioned to reveal a clear watery fluid. Adjacent to the right fallopian tube a 2.1 x 1.2 x 0.6 cm tan-white, smooth
ovary that is bivalved to reveal a variegated tan-pink cut surface. Representative sections are submitted as follows:
Al 12:00 Cervix.
A2 Anterior lower uterine segment.
A3 6:00 Cervix.
A4 Posterior lower uterine segment.
A5 Full thickness anterior wall.
A6-A7 Representative sections of the tumor that is erupting through the left lateral wall (to the inked surface).
AB-Al 1 One full thickness section from the posterior wall (serially sectioned).
Al 2-Al 9 Additional representative sections from the mass.
A20 Representative sections of the left fallopian tube.
A21-A22 The entire left ovary.
A23 Representative sections of the right fallopian tube.
A24-A25Entire right ovary.
A26-A28 Additional anterior cervix (to the inked black circumferential resection margin).
A29 Right parametrium.
A30 Left parametrium.
A31 Representative section from a tumor nodule within the anterior cervical/lower uterine segment.
If immunohistochemical stains and /or in situ hybridization are cited in this report ,the performance characteristics were determined by the
in compliance with CLIA'88
regulations. Some of these tests rely on the use of ""analyte specific reagents"" and are subject to specific labeling requirements by the FDA. Known
positive and negative control tissues demonstrate appropriate staining .This testing was developed by the _

END OF REPORT Page 5 of 5 ."," Site: Uterus
Justification: The procedure performed was an abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and the microscopic description clearly indicates endometrial carcinoma in the uterus.

Laterality: Not provided
Justification: Endometrial carcinoma is not typically associated with laterality as it occurs in the internal lining of the uterus.

Histology: Endometrioid adenocarcinoma with clear cell differentiation
Justification: The microscopic description and immunohistochemical stains support this type of endometrial carcinoma.

Stage: pT1b pNO
Justification: According to the TNM staging system, pT1b indicates that the tumor has invaded the inner half of the muscular wall of the uterus, and pNO means no regional lymph node metastasis.

Grade: III (FIGO grade 1411)
Justification: The FIGO grading system classifies endometrial carcinoma into three grades based on the degree of differentiation, with grade III being the least differentiated.

Behavior: Malignant
Justification: Endometrial carcinoma is a malignant tumor that can invade surrounding tissues and metastasize to distant organs.",Endometrioid adenocarcinoma with clear cell differentiation,pT1b pNO,III (FIGO grade 1411),Malignant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A. CERVIX/UTERUS/LEFT AND RIGHT TUBES AND OVARIES
Labeled with the patient's name, labeled ""cervix/uteruslleft and right tubes and ovaries"" and received
fresh in the operating room for frozen section consultation and subsequently fixed in formalin is an intact
62.5 gm total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy specimen. The uterus is about 4.5 x 4.3
x 3.5 cm. The cervix is 3.5 cm in length and has a width of 3.1 cm. The endometrial cavity is 3.8 cm in
length and has a maximum width of 2.2 cm. The left fimbriated fallopian tube is 6.5 cm in length and has
a maximal width of 0.6 cm. The left ovary is 2.7 x 1.1 x 1.0 cm. The right fimbriated fallopian tube is 6.5
cm in length and has a maximum width of 0.5 cm. The right ovary is 2.9 x 1.3 x 1.3 cm. The uterine wall
thickness ranges in size from 0.7 cm to 1.3 cm. A small amount of parametrial tissue is present
bilaterally. The left parametrial tissue is purple-tan, smooth and glistening and is 0.6 x 0.5 cm.
Within the posterior endometrial cavity in the corpus and fundus, there is a soft, irregular, polypoid white-
tan mass that is 4.0 x 3.8 x 1.3 cm. The lesion grossly involves the lower uterine segment. The cut
surface of the lesion shows no myometrial invasion. The cut surface of the mass is white-tan,
homogeneous with no areas of hemorrhage or necrosis grossly identified. The uterine serosa is grossly
free of tumor.
Within the intramural portion of the anterior uterine corpus there is an intramural, white-tan, semi-firm,
well-circumscribed leiomyoma. The leiomyoma is 2.7 x 2.2 x 0.7 cm. The cut surface of the leiomyoma
shows focal areas of yellow-tan calcified areas. The remaining cut surface is white-tan, semi-firm, and
whorled pattern with no areas of hemorrhage or necrosis grossly identified. Within the right fallopian tube
there is a paratubal cyst within the mid third of the fallopian tube that measures 0.6 x 0.3 cm. The serosal
surface of the cyst is white-tan, semi-translucent, and smooth and glistening. Sectioning through the cyst
reveals semitranslucent, straw-colored cyst fluid. The lining of the cyst wall is tan, smooth and glistening
with no masses or lesions seen grossly protruding from the cyst lining into the lumen of the cyst. Within
the left ovary is a single corpora albicans which measures 0.2 cm in greatest dimension. The right ovary
shows multiple white-tan, firm corpora albicans that range in size from 0.1 to 0.2 cm in greatest
dimension.

accreditation by the Commission on Cancer. Pathology stage is based solely
upon the current tissue specimen being evaluated, and does not incorporate
information on any specimens submitted separately to our Cytology section,

COMMENT: Dr. has reviewed portions of this case. The adenocarcinoma
is infiltrative into the muscle of the lower uterine segment and is present
immediately at the junction of the lower uterine segment and cervix. Although,
technically this tumor is not invasive into cervix, this lesion may behave as
if the cervix is involved. As with the prior biopsy,
there are focal areasconsistent with endometrioid adenocarcinoma, but the predominant pattern is
that of serous adenocarcinoma.
Immunoperoxidase stains for cytokeratin on part E are negative, helping to
rule out metastatic carcinoma in this site.
I certify that I personally conducted the diagnostic evaluation of the abovespecimen(s) and have rendered the abovediagnosis(es).

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. The first container A Is labeled uterus,
cervix .The specimen consists of a previously bisected
uterus with attached cervix. The uterus measures 8.5 x 8.0
x 2.5 cm and weighs 131 grams. The serosal surface of the
uterus is gray to brown tan with hemorrhage and adhesions.
Orientation can not be grossly determined .The serosa has
been inked .The cervix measures 5.0 cm in length and 2.0 cm
in diameter and has a 0 .7 cm slit patent as. The ectocervix
is gray to brown tan .The endocervical canal is light tan
roughened with slight hemorrhage .The endometrial cavity
measures 9.0 x 8 .5 cm and is completely lAvolved by a gray
tan shaggy mass that extends through the lower uterine
segment into the upper portions of the endocervical canal
measuring in total 11 .0 x 8.5 cm and is grossly 2 .0 cm from
the ectocervix .On sectioning through the mass ,in the area
of the lower uterine segment and upper endocervical canal,
the mass extends into the underlying wall and Is
approximately 0.7 cm and is 0 .7 cm from the resected margin.
On sectioning the cut surface of the mass is gray tan soft
and friable .There is a focal area of almost complete full
thickness invasion into the underlying myometrium
approximately 2.0 cm into a 2 .2 cm thick myometrium. The
myometrium Is gray tan trabecular .There are no lesions
grossly identified .Received with the specimen are two
cassettes, one green and one yellow ,labeled
Representative sections are submitted in cassettes

reagent specificity ,values from
different assay methods cannot be used

Sr."," Site: Uterus
The postoperative diagnosis is serous endometrial cancer.

Laterality: Not applicable
As the cancer is in the uterus, the concept of laterality does not apply.

Histology: Serous
The histologic type of endometrial cancer is serous, as determined by the preoperative and postoperative diagnoses.

Stage: pT2, NO, MO (FIGO 11)
The cancer has been staged as pT2, NO, MO according to the AJCC 2010 staging system, which corresponds to FIGO stage 11. This is based on the gross description of the specimen and the negative findings from the biopsies of the diaphragm and omentum.

Grade: Not provided
The grade of the cancer has not been specified in the given report. The grade refers to how different the cancer cells look compared to normal cells and is often expressed as a number on a scale of 1-3 or as low, moderate, or high grade.

Behavior: Malignant
Endometrial cancer is a malignant neoplasm, meaning it has the ability to invade surrounding tissues and spread to other parts of the body. This is supported by the gross description of the specimen, which mentions a focal area of almost complete full-thickness invasion into the underlying myometrium.",Serous,"pT2, NO, MO (FIGO 11)",,Malignant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

x 2.7 x 1.6 cm), and right fimbriated fallopian tube (7.1 cm long x 0.5 am indiameter). The uteruswas receivedopen from the OR, chiseled and grossly
distorted. Extending 0.4 cm into a 3.5 cm thick myometrium is a 3.4 x 1.4 x
0.5 cm (protruding into cavity) soft, tan, friable endometrial mass that
involves both the anterior and posterior endometrium.The mass is 3.5 cm fromthe anterior and posterior lower uterinesegment. Afull-thickness section of the mass andunderlying myometrium was frozenas representative AF1-2. Theuninvolved endometrium (0.1 cm thick) is smooth, tan, and is within a 3.1 cm
wide x 7.6 cm long endometrial cavity. The myometrium has eight homogenous,
white, whorled nodules ranging from 0.7 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm up to 4.3 x 3.5 x 3.5
cm, each of which bulge on cut section. At the posterior lower uterinesegment isa 3.8 x 3.1 x 2.5 cm full-thickness defect with surrounding
tattered soft tissue. The cervixis 2.8 cm in diameter and has a scant amountof recognizable smooth, white ectocervix and a grossly distorted endocervicalcanal. The serosa istan and smooth with a single subserosal homogenous,white, whorled nodule (2.2 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm).
The left ovarian surface issmooth, yellow-tan. The parenchymahas a 0.9 x0.9 x 0.8 cm smooth, well-circumscribed, rubbery, pink-purple nodule that is
0.2 cm to the capsule. The right ovarian surface is smooth, tan-yellow. There
is a 1.2 x 1.1 x 1 cm smooth, rubbery, tan, lobulated nodule that is 0.1 cm to
the capsule. The remainder of the left and right ovarian parenchyma are
unremarkable. The right fimbria is dusky purple-red and the left and rightfallopian tube mucosaare each diffusely erythematous.

IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL FINDINGS:
Immunohistochemical stains for inhibin and calretinin are performed on the
left ovarian nodule (slide A16 )and are strongly positive supporting the
diagnosis of hilus cell tumor.
Immunohistochemical stains performed on the right ovarian nodule show strong
staining for inhibin and weak staining for actin . s negative. Thisimmunohistochemical profile supports cellular fibroma.

Comment: Within the hysterectomy specimen, there are a few foci suspicious for
lymphovascular invasion by tumor. The specimen is received disrupted and
artifactual displacement of tumor into lymphatic spaces is a possibility. Dr.
was consulted and concurs.
Sections of the right ovarian nodule show a cellular spindle cell neoplasm
with increased mitotic activity , and no cytologic atypia. The
spindle cells are positive for inhibin supporting a mitotically active
cellular fibroma. Dr. as also reviewed sections from the right
ovary and concurs with this interpretation.

This service has been performed In part by a resident /fellow under the direction of a teachingphysician."," Site: Uterus
Justification: The specimen is labeled as ""uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes, bilateral ovaries"" and the gross description and microscopic examination support a diagnosis of endometrial cancer in the uterus.

Laterality: Not provided
Justification: The report does not mention any laterality as the cancer is in the uterus, which is a midline structure.

Histology: Endometrioid adenocarcinoma
Justification: The microscopic examination reveals an endometrial carcinoma with glandular differentiation, consistent with endometrioid adenocarcinoma.

Stage: pT2a, N0, MX
Justification: The tumor invades more than half of the myometrium (pT2a), but there is no evidence of lymph node involvement (N0) or distant metastasis (MX).

Grade: Not provided
Justification: The report does not mention the grade of the tumor. Grade refers to how differentiated the cancer cells are and is an important prognostic factor.

Behavior: Malignant
Justification: The diagnosis of endometrial carcinoma implies malignant behavior, as it is a type of cancer that can invade surrounding tissues and metastasize to distant organs.",Endometrioid adenocarcinoma,"pT2a, N0, MX",,Malignant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

inflammatory changes, hemorrhages, and necrosis arepresent
Myometrial invasion by carcinoma is superficial and
involves less than 209. of the uterine wall thickness
No unequivocal lymphatic or vascular invasion by tumor
is evident; however, retraction artifacts and
inflammatory changes hamper evaluation for lymphovascularinvasion in some areas
No extension of tumor into cervix

1: UTERUS CERVIX BILATERAL TUBES
Labeled with the patient' s name, designated ""uterus cervix andPage: 3
bilateral tubes"", received fresh in the Operating Room for gross
consultation, and subsequently fixed in formalin, is a 140 gram
total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy specimen.
The uterus was previously incised on both sides at the time of
intraoperative consultation. The uterus is slightly distorted in
shape. The uterus is about 8.5 cm from the fundus to the
ectocervix, 5.5 cm from cornu to cornu, and up to 4.2 cm from the
anterior surface to the posterior surface. The uterine serosa is
red-tan and smooth. The cervix is about 3.0 cm in long and up to
3.6 cm in maximum diameter in the ectocervical region. Attached to
the ectocervix, there is a short (less than 0.3 cm long) cuff of
grossly unremarkable pink-tan vaginal mucosa. The mucosa lining the
ectocervix is tan-pink, focally wrinkled, but otherwise smooth. The
external cervical os is patent and about 0.3 cm in diameter. The
cervical transformation zone is distinct. The endocervical canal is Page 3 of 5
about 2.5 cm long. Within the endocervical canal, there is
relatively abundant mucoid material that is blood-tinged. The
endocervical mucosa is tan and rugose. Cut sections of the cervix
reveal several tiny to small mucus-filled cysts, ranging from about
0.1 to 0.3 cm in diameter. The cervix appearsgrossly free of
tumor. The endometrial cavity is about 5.5 cm long and up to 3.2 cm
in width. Within the posterior uterus, there is a large friable,
polypoid to papillated tan-red tumor mass that extends from the
posterior fundus to the posterior lower uterine segment. The tumor
measuresabout 5.5 x 3.0 cm in surface area. The surface of the
tumor is focally hemorrhagic and focally necrotic. Cut sections
reveal a maximum tumor thickness of about 0.8 cm. Cut sections of
the posterior uterus reveal superficial myometrial invasion involving
less than 20% of the uterine wall thickness. The endometrium of the
posterior uterus (from the fundus to the lower uterine segment) is
tan to red-tan, smooth, and has a maximum thickness of less than 0.1
cm. No endometrial tumor is seen in the anterior uterus. Cut
sections of the uterus also reveal six circumscribed leiomyomas, one
of which is submucosal, two of which are subserosal, and the
remainder of which are intramural. The leiomyomas are each well
circumscribed and range from about 0.2 to 1.5 cm in maximum
dimensions. Each of the leiomyomas is composed of firm solid tan-
white whorled tissue with grossly evident areas of hemorrhage or
necrosis. The muscular uterine wall has a maximum thickness of about
2.0 cm. The uninvolved myometrium is tan and firm. The left
fallopian tube has fimbria at one end, is 5.4 cm long, up to 0.5 cm
in diameter, has a smooth, pink-tan serosal surface, a pinpoint
patent lumen, and appears grossly free of tumor. The left ovary is
atrophic, about 1.8 x 1.5 x 0.7 cm and has a cerebriform, tan-yellow
serosal surface with a few tiny adhesions. Cut surfaces of the left
ovary reveal a peripheral rim of yellow-tan cortical stroma and
multiple corpora albicantia, but no gross evidence of tumor. The
white fallopian tube has fimbria at one end, is about 5.2 cm long, up
to 0.4 cm in diameter, has a smooth, tan-pink serosal surface, and a
pinpoint patent lumen. The right fallopian tube appears grossly free
of tumor. The rightovaryis atrophic, about 2.0 x 1.3 x 0.9 cm, and
has a cerebriform to undulated, yellow-tan serosal surface with
multiple adhesions. Cut surfaces of the right ovary reveal a
peripheral rim of yellow-tan cortical stroma, several minute to tiny
cystic spaces, several corpora albicantia, and no gross evidence oftumor.

x 4.2 cm symmetrical uterine corpus with attached 3 cm cervix and
bilateral adnexa. The serosa is smooth tan-pink-red with a few
delicate tan-pink fibrous adhesions along the posterior aspect. The
annular 2.6 cm tan-pink ectocervix surrounds a 0.5 x 0.25 cm ovoid
patent os. Endocervical mucosa is mildly trabecular tan-pink. The
triangular 4 x 3.6 cm uterine cavity is lined by focally
papilliferous tan-pink endometrium. No tissue procurement is
performed. On sectioning, the papilliferous portion of the
endometrium appear in keeping with a lesion with a maximal thickness
of 1.4 cm, grossly extending greater than 2/3s of the endometrium
posteriorly. The remaining presumptively uninvolved endometrium is
flat and averages 0.1 cm in thickness. The myometrium is smooth,
pale tan and measures up to 2 cm in thickness. A few
well-circumscribed, rubbery whorled tan-white leiomyomata measuring
up to 1.5 cm in greatest dimension are present. Bilaterally, the
cerebriform pale tan-gold ovaries average 2.1 x 1.5 x 1.1 cm.
Stroma of both ovaries is pale tan with identifiable corpora
albicantia. The left ovary contains a single, smooth-lined cyst
measuring 0.7 cm. No tubal tissue is identified grossly.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A.Received fresh for gross evaluation labeled with the patient's name and designated
""uterus, tubes and ovaries"" is a 141 gram, 8.0 x 5.5 x 3.5 cm uterus. The uterus is
received with the attached bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries and weighed with the tubes
and ovaries removed. The serosa is smooth, and there is a right, pedunculated 4.5 x 4.5 x
4,0 cm subserosal massnear the adnexal attachment. The uterine serosa is otherwise smooth
and unremarkable. There is focal ecchymotic hemorrhage on the ectocervix. The ectocervix
has a 1.0 cm slit-like os. The uterus is bivalved to have a fungating, polypoid appearing
tumor mass in the fundus. The mass is 4.0 x 4.0 x 1.0 cm and is predominantly posterior.
The tumor comes to within 4.0 cm of the cervical os. The tumor appears superficial and
does not appear to involve or invade the myometrium. The myometrium averages 2.0 cm both
anterior and posterior, and there are multiple intramural submucosal circumscribed white
whorled leiomyomata. The intramural leiomyomata range up to 1.5 cm and have focal
peripheral calcifications. No areas of hemorrhage or necrosis are identified. The
endometrium adjacent to the polypoid tumor area averages 0.1 to 0.2 cm. The right
fallopian tube is fimbriated and is a tortuous 5.0 x 4.0 cm, The adjacent ovary is 2.8 x
1.4 x 1.4 cm and has superficial fibrous adhesions. The ovary is sectioned to have an
unremarkable, yellow tan stroma with focal corpora albicantia. The left fallopian tube is
fimbriated and is 5.0 x 0.5 cm. The left ovaryis 2.0 x 1.4 x 1.3 cm and has focal

8 -largest intramural, focally calcified leiomyoma sampled
9 -largest pedunculated subserosal leiomyoma sampled
10-11 -right and left fallopian tube and ovary sampled
Received in 5 additional parts. Each part is in formalin and labeled with the patient's
name.
B.Part 2 labeled ""left parametrium"" is a 1,2 x 1.0 x 0.8 cm portion of yellow adipose. The
biopsy is bisected and entirely submitted in cassette B1.
C.Part 3 labeled ""right parametrium"" is a 1.7 x 1.0 x 0.8 cm portion of fatty
fibroconnective tissue. The specimen is bisected and entirely submitted cassette Cl.
D. Part 4 labeled ""right pelvic lymph node"" is a 3.8 x 2.0 x 1.8 cm portion of yellow
adipose. The adipose is trimmed to have three nodular, fatty lymph nodes. The two smaller
lymph nodes will be submitted in toto cassette Di with the larger, 2,0 cm lymph node
trisected and entirely submitted in cassette D2.
E.Part 5 labeled ""left pelvic lymph node"" is a 3.0 x 2.0 x 1.8 cm aggregate of yellow,
lobulated adipose. The adipose is sectioned to have three possible lymph nodes. The nodes
range up to a flattened 1.4 cm. The two smaller lymph notes are submitted in toto El with
the largest node serially sectioned and entirely submitted E2,

endometrial adenocarcinoma, endometrioid type, is
identified forming
a mass (6.6 x 6.2 x 1.6 cm), circumferentially involving
the
endometrial cavity. The tumor invades 0.8 cm into the
myometrium
(total wall thickness, 1.4 cm). The tumor does not
involve the
endocervix. Lymphovascular space invasion is not
identified. The
margins are negative for tumor. The bilateral ovaries and
fallopian
tubes are unremarkable. [AJCCpT1cNOM0].
B. C. D. E. Lymph nodes, right pelvic, excision:
Multiple right
pelvic lymph nodes (3 external iliac, 4 internal iliac, 3
common
iliac, and 2 obturator) are negative for tumor.
F. G. H. I. Lymph nodes, left pelvic, excision: Multiple
left
pelvic lymph nodes (6 external iliac, 3 internal iliac, 3
common
iliac, and 4 obturator) are negative for tumor.

Gross Description
1. The specimen container Is labeled with the patient 's name and as ""Uterus : Cervix, Bilateral Tubes and Ovaries"". The
specimen consists of a total hysterectomy specimen with attached bilateral salpingo -oophorectomy . The specimen has a
fresh weight of 52 .5 g. The uterus and cervix measures 7.0 cm SI x 4.5 cm ML x 3.3 cm AP. The cervix has a maximum
diameter of 1.6 cm . The external os measures 0.4 cm and is oval. The right fallopian tube measures 5.7 cm length by 0.5
cm In diameter . The right ovary measures 1.3x 1.4 x 0.3 cm. The left fallopian tube measures 5.0 cm in length by 0.6 in
diameter . The left ovary measures 1.7 x 1.1 x 1.0 cm.
The uterine serosa is tan and smooth with a white nodule on the posterior aspect measuring 0.4 cm maximum dimension.
The exocervix is pink tan and smooth with query of the anterior exocervix is partly missing .The endocervical canal
measures 2.3 cm In length .The endometrial cavity demonstrates an ill-defined friable tan-brown tumor measuring 2.5 cm
SI x 2.3 cm ML x 2 .8 cm AP. The tumor measures 0.3 cm from the anterior serosat surface and 0 .9 cm from the posterior
serosal surface . The myometrium Is tan and demonstrates a well circumscribed white nodule in the posterior aspect
measuring 0.6 cm .Both fallopian tubes show fimbria . The outer surface of the ovaries is white tan and partly cerebriform.
The cut surface of each ovary is tan and unremarkable .Within the paraovarian tissue there are two calcified nodules the
largest measuring 0.2 cm. Tissue is stored frozen.

COMENT: The original biopsy material showing FTG0 3 endometrioid cancer
(architecture 2, nuclei 3) was reviewed. When looking at both the. tumor
from the biopsy and the hysterectomy together, however, the amount of high
gradenuclear features is insufficient to warrant raising the FIGO score
above a 2. The majority of the nuclei are of intermediate grade. with ,a
small focus of high grade nuclei composing <5% of the tumor nuclei. These
higher grade nuclei were more concentrated in the biopsy material than the
final hysterectomy material. In sum, the final FIGO score is FIGO 2.

CLINICAL INFORMATION:
Endometrial carcinoma.
GROSS DESCRIPTION:
1.The specimen is received fresh and labeled ""uterus cervix tubes and
ovaries"" and consists of a total hysterectomy specimen weighing 212 g and
having the following measurements: 4.0 cm from cornu to cornu, 6.5 cm from
the anterior to posterior uterine fundus and 11.0 cm from the base of the
uterine fundus to the cervical os. Bilateral adnexa are attached and
consists of grossly unremarkable fallopian tubes which measure up to 2.0 x
0.8 x 0,8 cm in greatest dimensions and bilateral grossly unremarkable
ovaries measuring up to 2.0 x 1.4 x 1,0 cm. The uterine fundus is
distorted by multiple subserosal and transmural well-circumscribed fibroids
measuring from 1.0 cm up to 2.5 cm in diameter. On opening the endometrial
cavity measures 7.0 x 3.0 cm and shows a thickened hyperemic soft friable
masspredominantly at the base of the anterior endometrial lining measuring
4.0 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm in overall dimensions. On sectioning, the mass grossly
extends into the subjacent tissue for approximately 0.2 cm. the remaining
endometrium is focally hemorrhagic and measures up to 0.2 cm in thickness.
The myometrium measures 3 .0 cm in thickness. The myometrium shows
multiple well-circumscribed tan-gray nodules along with focal pinpoint Patient Name:

Justification: The patient underwent a radical hysterectomy, and the final diagnosis is endometrioid carcinoma with no involvement of the endocervical canal or lower uterine segment. The tumor extends up to 5 mm into an 18 mm thick myometrium, and there is no evidence of lymphovascular space invasion. All surgical margins are negative, and there is no evidence of malignancy in the examined lymph nodes. However, there is background hyperplasia present in the endometrium, adenomyosis in the myometrium, and focal endometriosis in the uterine serosa and left ovary. The tumor grade is classified as high based on marked nuclear pleomorphism and a high mitotic rate, despite the growth pattern suggesting a lower grade.",Endometrioid carcinoma,"pT1b, NO",High grade (based on marked nuclear pleomorphism and high mitotic rate),Malignant (invasive carcinoma with no evidence of lymph node metastasis),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

os. Separately received is a 1.1 gram, 2.9 x 2.3 x 2.1 cm fibroid nodule.
Opening the uterus reveals diffusely granular and hemorrhagic endometrium with
multiple friable, tan-brown irregular exophytic masses involving fundus,
cornu, and anterior and posterior walls, up to 3.9 x 3.6 x 1.4 cm. The
myometrium averages 1.9 cm thick. Beneath the tumor nodules the myometrium
is white, firm, and fibrotic, suggestive of full thickness invasion. The
endometrial cavity is 7.1 cm in length x 5.5 cm in diameter. The endocervical
canal is 4.1 cm in length x 0.8 cm in diameter. The serosa is smooth and
glistening with no mass or lesions.
The right ovary is 3.9 x 1.3 x 1.1 cm, the cut surface reveals 0.4 x 0.5 x 0.2
cm simple cystic lesion with no excrescences. The right fallopian tube is 5.1
cm in length x 0.5 cm in diameter with two paratubal cysts, ranging from
0.7-1.6 cm in greatest dimension.
The left ovary is 3.9 x 1.8 x 0.8 cm. Sectioning the left ovary reveals two
pale nodules, 0.4-0.5 cm in greatest dimension. The left fallopian tube is

PATHOLOGIC STAGE (AJCC 7th Edition): pT2 pN2 pMX
NOTE: Information on pathology stage and the operative procedure is
transmitted to this Institution's Cancer Registry as required for
accreditation by the Commission on Cancer. Pathology stage is based solely
upon the current tissue specimen being evaluated, and does not incorporate
information on any specimens submitted separately to our Cytology section,
past pathology information, imaging studies, or clinical or operative
findings. Pathology stage is only a component to be considered in determining
the clinical stage, and should not be confused with nor substituted for it.
The exact operative procedure is available in the surgeon's operative report.
DIAGNOSIS:
A. ""RIGHT PARAAORTIC LYMPH NODE"" (LYMPHADENECTOMY):
METASTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA IN TWO OF FIVE LYMPH NODES (2/5).

OVARIES, RIGHT AND LEFT: NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.
RIGHT FALLOPIAN TUBE: NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.
LEFT FALLOPIAN TUBE: FOCALLY SUSPICIOUS FOR INVOLVEMENT BY CARCINOMA.
COMMENT: The endometrial carcinoma is difficult to classify. The tumor in
the lumen has a pattern suggestive of endometrioid carcinoma, but essentially
all of the deeper invasive tumor in the wall has a serous morphology, with
micropapillary tufts and easily identifiable psammoma bodies. Because of the
preponderance of serous differentiation in the invasive component, it is
classified as a serous carcinoma.

uterus is 12cm from fundus to lower uterine segment, 11 cm from comua to comua and 8.3cm from
anterior to posterior. The serosa is tan pink and smooth. The specimen is bivalved into anterior and
posterior halves to reveal a tan pink friable mass 11 x 9.5 x 7.5cm, occupying 100% of the cavity and
attached to the posterior aspect of the specimen. The mass grossly appear to be confined to the
endometrium. The uninvolved endometrium is 0.1 cm. The uninvolved trabeculated myometrium is
2.3cm and remarkable fora 1.4 x 1.3 x 1 cm tan white firm well circumscribed mass .The mass is
sectioned to reveal a homogenous white whorled cut surface without areas of hemorrhage or necrosis.
The attached left tan pink cerebriform ovary is 1.3 x 0.9 x 0.7cm, is bivalved to reveal unremarkable
parenchyma. The attached left fimbriated fallopian tube is 4cm in length x 1 cm in diameter. The
fallopian tube is serially sectioned to reveal a patent lumen. A portion of the specimen is submitted for
tissue procurement. Gross photographs are taken. Representatively submitted as follows:

Reviewer I^iNalDar ! view ? .^----"," Site: The tumor is primarily located in the endometrium, with metastatic lesions on the omentum, bladder peritoneum, and possibly other sites as indicated by positive peritoneal cytology.

Laterality: The tumor involves both sides of the adnexa (ovaries and fallopian tubes).

Histology: The tumor is a high-grade carcinosarcoma (malignant Mullerian mixed tumor) with heterologous malignant stroma and prominent rhabdomyosarcomatous component, as well as a high-grade serous carcinoma component.

Stage: The pathologic stage is pT3b Nx Mx, indicating that the tumor has invaded the serosa or adjacent structures but lymph node status and distant metastasis are not known.

Grade: The tumor is high grade based on the WHO classification.

Behavior: The tumor is malignant with a poor prognosis, given its high grade, extensive size, and metastatic spread. Not provided: Prior biopsy diagnosis, cytology case number, and surgical approach (e.g., total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy, and lymph node dissection).","high-grade carcinosarcoma (malignant Mullerian mixed tumor) with heterologous malignant stroma and prominent rhabdomyosarcomatous component, as well as a high-grade serous carcinoma component",pT3b Nx Mx,high grade,malignant with a poor prognosis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gross Description
A. Received fresh for frozen section labeled ""uterus and cervix"" is a previously opened uterus with attached cervix weighing
234.0 grams and measuring 10.0 x 8.0 x 8.0 cm in the open state. The cervix measures 3.0 x 3.0 cm; the cervical os is free of
any discrete lesion. The serosal surface is tan to pink and smooth. The endometrial cavity is filled with a large fungating, tan-
red exophytic friable mass, measuring approximately 6.5 x 6.5 x 3.0 cm. The tumor extends from the fundus to the lower
uterine segment ; the upper endocervical canal appears free of tumor. On cut section, the tumor grossly appears to be invade
more than half of the myometrial thickness (myometrial thickness 2.0 cm, myometrial thickness at the deepest tumor invasion
is 0.7 cm). The bulk of the tumor Is present on the posterior endometrial wall. The anterior endometrial wall has uninvolved
endometrium which measures up to 0.3 cm in thickness. The uninvolved myometrium is tan to pink and has a small
leiomyoma, measuring 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.8 cm. Representative sections are submitted.

Venous/Lymphatic Invasion: Not identified
Comment : Tissue ""B"" - The vast bulk of this tumor exhibits the histology of a moderately well-
differentiated endometrioid-type adenocarcinoma. In a few small foci, however, this tumor exhibits
high-grade features which closely approach, but do not quite attain the histologic character of serous
carcinoma (Dr.. . Therefore, an unequivocal serous component is not identified in this
specimen.

Justification: The tumor type identified is endometroid adenocarcinoma, NOS (not otherwise specified), indicating a primary uterine source.

Laterality: Not provided
Justification: The report does not mention any laterality information, such as whether the cancer affected one or both sides of the uterus.

Histology: Endometroid adenocarcinoma, NOS
Justification: This is the tumor type identified in the report.

Stage: pT3b, pNO
Justification: The T stage (tumor invasion depth) is pT3b, and there are no positive lymph nodes (pNO). However, the total number of lymph nodes examined is 26, with all of them negative for tumor cells.

Grade: Poorly differentiated (FIGO 3)
Justification: The report mentions a poorly differentiated histologic grade, which corresponds to FIGO grade 3.

Behavior: Malignant
Justification: The presence of high-grade, poorly differentiated carcinoma in the left posterior cul-de-sac tissue and positive pelvic cytology for malignant cells indicate a malignant behavior of the tumor.","Endometroid adenocarcinoma, NOS","pT3b, pNO",Poorly differentiated (FIGO 3),Malignant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The uterus is received previously opened with defect in posterior lower uterine segment..:'
The sections from lower uterine segment show deep myometrial invasion of endometrial;adenocarcinoma .However,uterine serosa involvement is not identified.
Sections of tumor show adenocareinoma with endometrioid features.Poorly differentiatedareas display sheets of tumor cells, which still have epithelioid features. The'
differential diagnosis includes carcinosarcoma.There is no heterologous component identified .Immunohistochemical stains of pancytokeratin is strong positive for tumorcells in gland and in the nongland forming areas.The vimentin is positive for
nongland forming tumor cells. The diagnosis of high grade endometrioid adenocarcinoma,,:is? favored .Representative sections are reviewed with Dr. and Dr.who concur with the interpretation.

GROSS EXAMINATION:
A. ""Uterus ,cervix,bilateral tubes and ovaries"", received fresh for frozen
section is a 114 gram hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy specimen . (NOTE:The specimen cannot be definitively oriented due to
extensive serosal and bilateral adnexal adhesions and probable endometriosis
which obscure the usual orienting landmarks.The orientations used below arepresumed .)There is a 3.1 x 2.1 cm area of heaped-up endometrium centered inthe posterior endometrium that grossly appears to invade 2.6 cm into the 3.2
cm thick myometrium .The mass is tan and friable ,with poorly defined borders ,and comes within approximately 0.5 cm of the posterior lower uterine
segment. The tumor does not involve the cervix or extend into the adnexa. The
0.2 an thick endometrium is otherwise unremarkable.The myometrium displaysapproximately five firm ,white,whorled nodules up to 1.7 cm in greatestdimension ,and is otherwise unremarkable .The cervix displays a lcm firm,white whorled submucosal nodule and is otherwise unremarkable.The posteriorserosal surface of the uterus is diffusely covered with shaggy,tan-grayfibrous tissue which is continuous with adhesions involving the bilateraladnexa.The right fallopian tube (3.5 cm long x 0.6 cm in diameter) isunremarkable .No definite right ovary is identified.Sectioning the rightadnexal soft tissue reveals numerous chocolate cysts of up to 0.6 cm in
greatest dimension .The left fallopian tube (3.5 cm long x 0.4 cm diameter)
is fixed to the anterior surface of the uterus by adhesions.No definite left ovary is identified .Sectioning the left adnexal soft tissue reveals a 2.7 cm
unilocular chocolate cyst covered with adhesions that is affixed to the
uterine fundus.

COMMENT: The tumor is an exophytic mass which is grossly suspicious for tumor
invasion into the outer half of the myometrium.The frozen section slidesalso show areas of apparent deep myometrial tumor invasion.However, multiplepermanent sections of these areas demonstrate that these tumor foci are
actually present within adenomyosis ,and do not invade the myometrium. This
finding is confirmed by an immunostain for CD10, which demonstrate4 A cuff of
endometrial stromal cells surrounding each tumor nest. Dr. notified

HISTORY: Endometrial carcinoma
MICROSCOPIC:
Neoplasm (S-Z) is a high grade carcinoma with many areas of solid
cell nests, focal papillary features, marked anisokaryosis and
poikilokaryosis, and many mitoses. Scattered small tumor islands haveclear cell features (T,W,Y).
STAGING:
At its deepest point (T) the tumor is about 0.2 cm from the uterine
serosa, and a metastatic nodule is in the adjacent serosa (T). In
one area (Y) the serosa is retracted in toward the invading
Cul de sac (D,E) and right uterosacral ligament (F,Gparametrium N tumor.
( ) have metastatic tumor.In eleven ) lymph andnodesright
various areas (H-K) there is no tumor. from
OTHER FEATURES:
Omentum (A-C), appendix (L,M), left parametrium (O), and lower
uterus/endocervix (P-R) are free of tumor. Background endometrium
(S,U,V,X) is thin and atrophic without hyperplasia or atypia. Small Page 2 of 3
mucus cysts and lymphoid aggregates with germinal centers in
posterior cervix (Q). Many uterine serosa fibrovascular adhesions
(S,X-Z). Right ovary (AA) has several small inclusion cysts. Left
ovary (BB) and the two tubes (AA,BB) essentially normal.

Comment
Focal areas exhibit a tubal pattern with cytoplasmic clearing consistent with focal features of clear cell carcinoma (slide
89). Depth of invasion Is difficult to measure because the tumor focus is polypoid . At it's closest point (slide 813), tumor is
approximately $ mm from serosa .In an adjacent section (on the same slide), the myometrium Is 14 mm thick, so depth of
invasion is calculated as 8 mm in a 14 mm thick myometrium.
Rarely vasculitis identified in the gyn tract Is associated with systemic disorders or symptoms.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. Received fresh labeled ""uterus, right and left tube and ovaries""
is a 160.0 gram uterus with attached bilateral fallopian tubes and
left ovary. The posterior uterine serosa and cul de sac has a 5.2 x
4.3 x 1.0 cm tumor mass. There is a 1.8 x 1.3 x 1.3 cm polypoid
mass in the right fundus of the endometrial cavity, grossly invading
0.7 cm. The myometrial thickness is 1.7 cm. There are no uterine
leiomyomas. There is an 8.5 x 6.7 x 4.2 cm aggregate of detached
tumor which contains and encases the right ovary (2.1 x 2.0 x 1.4
cm). The ovary contains a 1.5 x 1.2 x 1.2 cm right ovarian cyst.
The attached right fallopian tube measures 6.5 x 0.6 cm. There is a
3.0 x 1.2 x 0.7 cm left ovary with a nodular outer surface and a
solid cut surface with a 7.4 x 0.6 cm left fallopian tube. There
are also multiple tumor nodules involving the surface of the left
ovary, the surfaces of the left and right fallopian tubes, and in
the right and left adnexal soft tissue (ranging in size from 0.3 cm
to 1.2 cm in greatest dimension). Representative sections are
submitted.
B. Received fresh labeled ""sigmoid colon"" is a 32.0 cm length
portion of sigmoid colon that has multiple (approximately 20)
red-pink irregular serosal nodules ranging in size from 0.5 cm to
11.5 cm in greatest dimension. The nodules appear to extend into
the muscle, without involvement of the overlying mucosa. There is a
scant portion of omentum that has multiple (5) nodules ranging in
size from 1.0 cm to 3.5 cm in greatest dimension. The mucosa has
approximately 63 diverticula. No gross perforation is identified. Representative sections are submitted.
C. Received fresh labeled "" omentum"" is a 66.0 x 19.0 x 2.3 cm
portion of omentum. There are multiple nodules ranging in size from
0.2 cm to 4.2 cm in greatest dimension. Lymph nodes are not
identified. Representative sections are submitted.

SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT
DIAGNOSIS:
A. UTERUS, FALLOPIAN TUBES, AND OVARIES:
- Primary uterine adenocarcinoma ,endometrioid type with associated squamous changes,
FIGO grade I, nuclear grade 2 (see comment)
- Tumor extensively involves the mucosa of the uterine fundus and uterine corpus
- Carcinoma also extends into lower uterine segment
- Myometrial invasion by tumor is present superficially (less than 50 %of wall is
involved)
- Dislodged fragments of tumor are present within some endothelial -lined spaces,
including veins ;an iatrogenic process is favored over true lymphovascular invasion
by tumor
- Cervix , including surgical margin is negative for tumor
- No involvement of parametrial tissues by tumor
- No evidence of metastatic carcinoma involving ovaries or fallopian tubes
Other findings include:
- Foci of endometrial glandular hyperplasia ,simple and complex types with varying
degrees with associated atypia
- Some inactive /weakly proliferative endometrium
- Tiny benign endometrial and endocervical polyps and a small mixed endometrial-
endocervical polyp
- Several small uterine leiomyomas ,some with associated hyalinization
- Adenomyosis
- Cervix also shows focal changes suggestive of prior curettage ,acute and chronic
inflammation, squamous metaplasia ,reactive epithelial changes, cystic endocervical
tunnel clusters and nabothian cysts
- Right ovary with atrophic changes and benign surface micropapillary epithelial
and stromal proliferation
Left ovary with atrophic changes and cystic epithelial inclusions
Both fallopian tubes show mild epithelialhyperplasia without significant atypia
B. LYMPH NODES, RIGHT PELVIC, EXCISION:
- Two reactive lymph nodes without evidence of metastatic carcinoma in routinely stained
sections or in sections stained for keratin (0/2)

A. UTERUS, CERVIX, BILATERAL FALLOPIAN TUBES AND OVARIES
Labeled with the patient 's name ,labeled ""uterus, cervix ,bilateral tubes and ovaries "",and received fresh in the
Operating Room for frozen section and subsequently fixed in formalin ,is a 68 gram total hysterectomy and bilateral
salpingo -oophorectomy specimen .The uterus is about 6 .5 x 5.5 x 3.0 cm in greatest overall dimensions. The
cervix is 2.8 cm long and up to 3.0 cm in diameter .The endometrial cavity is about 4.5 cm long and up to 3.7 cm in
width. The uninvolved endometrium has a maximum thickness of 0.2 cm. The muscular uterine wall ranges from
about 1 .1 to 1.4 cm in thickness .The fimbriated right fallopian tube is 4 .3 cm long and ranges from 0.2 to 0.4 cm in
diameter with a maximum luminal diameter of 0.1 cm. The right ovary is 2.6 x 1.1 x 0. 7 cm. The fimbriated left
fallopian tube is 5.2 cm long and ranges from 0.2 to 0.3 cm in diameter with a maximum luminal diameter of less
than 0 .1 cm. The left ovary is about 2.1 x 1.4 x 0.5 cm.
In the anterior uterine fundus, there is a soft friable exophytic /polypoid tumor mass that is about 2 .3 x 0.8 x 0.2 cm.
Cut sections in the vicinity of the polypoid lesion reveal superficial involvement of the underlying myometrium by
tumor .Much of the rest of the mucosa of the adjacent uterine corpus and lower uterine segment shows irregular
slightly shaggy pale tan and focally friable endometrium that may also be involved by tumor .Also received in the
same container is a separate 2.5 x 1.5 x 0. 5 cm aggregate of similar-appearing soft friable tan tumor . The cervix
appears grossly free of tumor .Attached to the uterus there is a small amount of parametrial soft tissue ,bilaterally
that also appears grossly free of tumor .No metastatic tumor is seen in the ovaries or fallopian tube.
Within the uterus there are three well -circumscribed intramural leiomyomas ,ranging from about 0.8 to 1.0 cm in
maximum dimension .Each of the leiomyomas are composed of firm solid tan-white tissue without grossly evident
areas of hemorrhage or necrosis . The cervix is remarkable only for several mucous -filled cysts ranging from less
than 0.1 to about 0 .3 cm in diameter .Both ovaries are atrophic and show no gross pathologic lesions . The fallopian
tubes are also grossly unremarkable.

CLINICAL HISTORY:
Malignant neoplasm of the uterus.
GROSS EXAMINATION:
A. ""Uterus, cervix ,bilateral tubes and ovaries (AF1)"". Received is a 114
gram, 9 x 7 x 3.2 cm uterus ,which is bivalved to reveal a 6.5 x 3.6 cm white,
friable, polypoid tumor that diffusely involves the anterior and posterior
endometrium .The tumor invades 1 cm deep in a 1.4 cm thick anterior wall and
1.1 cm into a 1.5 cm posterior wall. It does not grossly involve the
endocervical canal and measures 4.2 cm from the ectocervix on the anterior
portion and 4.6 cm from the ectocervix on the posterior portion of the
uterus. A minimal amount of uninvolved endometrium is identified. A 0.6 x
0.5 x 0.4 cm nodule is identified in the posterior endocervix .This lesionappears well -circumscribed and is grossly consistent with a submucosal
leiomyoma .The remaining endocervix ,and ectocervix are grossly unremarkable.
The specimen also demonstrates ovaries (left ovary -2.2 x 1.2 x 0.9 cm; right
ovary 3.4 x 2.2 x 0.4 cm) and fallopian tubes (left fallopian tube - 5 x 0.6 x
0.4 cm; right fallopian tube - 5 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm ).Both ovaries are
hemorrhagic on cut surface but are otherwise grossly unremarkable .The left
fallopian tube is unremarkable ;however the right fallopian tube displays an
area of cautery artifact and is discontinuous.

MSI (microsatellite instability )Screening by Immunohistochemistry
to evaluate for MLHI, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 Protein Expression
Specimen : Endometrioid adenocarcinoma in the uterus, tissue block
Control :Internal control.
Method: lmmunohistochemical staining (IHC) was used to determine the presence or absence of protein expression for
MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2. Lymph--,,,-- ""Â°""'""' if aA n.i^ionr ctnininn and served as nncifivQ rnntrr lc fr,r'+aininq of
these proteins. (MSI panel performed by
Results : Normal MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 protein expression within the tumor was
demonstrated by immunohistochemistry. No evidence of MSI (microsatellite instability) is identified by
this technique. See Comment.
Comment : Immunoperoxidase studies for MLHI, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 were ordered on the uterine
neoplasm to screen for MSI (microsatellite instability)/Lynch syndrome. The finding of MLHI, MSH2, MSH6, and
PMS2 protein expression suggests the presence of normal DNA mismatch repair function within the tumor.
Thus, the likelihood that this individual has an inherited cancer syndrome due to defective DNA mismatch repair
(Lynch syndrome) is low. However, these results cannot rule out the possibility that this individual's tumor is due
to an Inherited defect in another gene not involved in mismatch repair. A significant fraction of Lynch cases do
not have defective DNA mismatch repair as the underlying genetic basis of their disease.
If there is a strong personal or family history of HNPCC related cancers for this patient, consider microsatellite
instability and IHC testing on a different tumor to further evaluate the possible role of defect DNA mismatch
repair.
If clinically warranted, additional testing for other markers of MSI/HNPCC (specifically, PCR-based assay to test
for tumor microsatellite instability with the use of tandem repeats) can be performed on the paraffin tissue block
upon request as a send out test. The results of additional testing may take up to 6 weeks.
A genetic consultation may be of benefit.
Caution : Test results should be interpreted In context of clinical findings, family history, and other laboratory
data.

Cross Description
A. The specimen is a 120 9. 9.5 x 6.0 x 3.5 cm hysterectomy
received with attached adnexa.The serosa is tan-brown ,smooth,
and unremarkable . The ectocervical mucosa is 4.0 x 3 .2 cm, with
erythema overlying the 12 to 6 o'clock position. The os is 0.9
cm, patent and leads intoa 2.2 cm longx 0.9 cm wide tan-white,
trabeculated endocervical canal. The endometrial cavity is
notable for a 4 x 2 cm tan -white flattened lesion on the anterior
wall that approaches the anterior lower uterine segment, and is
2.5 cm from the external os. Further sectioning reveals that the
lesion is 0.5 cm thick and 1. 5 cm from the overlying serosa. The
myometrium is 2 cm thick, tan-white with prominent tubular
structures.
The left adnexa are 10.29 and consists of a 2 x 1 x 1 cm ovary, a
3.5 cm in length x up to 0 .6 cm in diameter fimbriated fallopian
tube, and attached meso-salpinx. The ovary is sectioned to
reveal no abnormalities. The fallopian tube is notable for a
previous tubal ligation and is otherwise unremarkable.
The right adnexa are 14.7g and consists of a 2.6 x 1.5 x 0.3 cm
ovary, a 4.5 cm in length x 0.6 cm in diameter fimbriated
fallopian tube, and attached meso-salpinx. The ovary is
sectioned to reveal a simple 0.8-cm serous fluid-filled cortical
cyst. The fallopian tube is notable for a previous tubal
ligation and two serous fluid-filled paratubal cysts that are up
to 1,2 cm_

LABEL: RESULTS COPY PRINTED"," Site: Cervix, Endometrium, Ovaries, and Fallopian Tubes
Laterality: Not applicable for diffuse involvement in the cervix and endometrium; Right and left for ovaries and fallopian tubes
Histology: The cervical and endometrial lesions are consistent with a primary tumor, likely of endocervical or endometrioid type, given the location and appearance. The right ovary contains a simple serous fluid-filled cortical cyst, while the right fallopian tube has two paratubal cysts.
Stage: Not provided, as this information is not available from the description.
Grade: Not provided, as no mention of tumor differentiation or architecture is given in the description.
Behavior: Malignant potential is likely for the cervical and endometrial lesions due to their appearance and size; benign for the ovarian and fallopian tube cysts.

Justification: The cervical and endometrial lesions' tan-white color, flattened or trabeculated appearance, and significant thickness suggest a malignant process, such as carcinoma. However, specific tumor type and grade cannot be determined without additional histological features. The ovarian and fallopian tube cysts are described as fluid-filled, which is consistent with benign cystic lesions.","The cervical and endometrial lesions are consistent with a primary tumor, likely of endocervical or endometrioid type, given the location and appearance.

DIAGNOSIS:
A. Uterus, bilateral ovaries and fallopian tubes;
hysterectomy and
bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy: FIGO grade III (of III)
endometrial adeno_carcinoma, endometrioid type, is
identified forming
a mass (3.6 x 2.5 x 2.2 cm) located in the anterior and
lateral
uterine wall. The tumor invades 1.7 cm into the
myometrium (total
wall thickness 2.0 cm). The tumor does not involve the
endocervix.
Lymphovascular space invasion is identified. There are
multiple
intramural leiomyomata ranging in size from 0.3 cm to 0.7
cm in
greatest dimension. The bilateral ovaries and fallopian
tubes are
atrophic and not involved.
B. Lymph node, right pelvic, biopsy: A single right
pelvic lymph
node is positive for metastatic carcinoma consistent with
endometrial primary.
C. Lymph nodes, left pelvic, biopsy: Multiple (2) left
pelvic
lymph nodes are positive for metastatic carcinoma
consistent with
endometrial primary.

background of polypoid atypical hyperplasia.(2.8 x 2.4 x
0.8 cm).
The adenocarcinoma (1.2 cm in greatest linear extent) is
limited to
the endometrium with no myometrial invasion. There is no
lymph-vascular space involvement. The endocervix is
uninvolved.
The myometrium shows superficial adenomyosis. The cervix
is
unremarkable.
Ovaries, left and right, oophorectomy: Atrophic ovary,

DIAGNOSIS:
A. Uterus, bilateral ovaries, and fallopian tubes;
hysterectomy and
bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy: FIGO II (of III)
endometrial
adenoc_d _incm type, is identified forming a
mass (2.9 '-`
x 2.1 x 0.7 cm), predominantly located in the anterior
uterine wall.
The tumor invades 0.4 cm into the myometrium (total wall
thickness
1.9 cm). The tumor does not involve the endocervix.
Lymphovascular
space invasion is not identified. The surgical resection
margins
are negative for tumor. Multiple (2) intramural
leiomyomata
(ranging in size from 0.3 cm to 0.5 cm in greatest
dimension) are
present. The background endometrium shows cystic atrophy.
The
bilateral ovaries and fallopian tubes are not involved and
are
without diagnostic abnormality.
B. Lymph nodes, right pelvic, lymphadenectomy: Multiple
(19) right
pelvic lymph nodes are negative for tumor.
C. Lymph nodes, left pelvic, lymphadenectomy: Multiple
(23) left
pelvic lymph nodes are negative for tumor.
