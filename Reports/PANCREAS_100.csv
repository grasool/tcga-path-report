Histology: Adenocarcinoma
Justification: Although the specific type of adenocarcinoma is not mentioned, it is a common histologic diagnosis for pancreatic tumors.

Stage: pT3NI (7th edition)
Justification: According to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC), this stage indicates that the primary tumor has invaded the peripancreatic soft tissues and there are metastases to regional lymph nodes.

B. Pancreas and spleen, partial pancreatectomy and splenectomy:
Undifferentiated carcinoma with a sarcomatoid component is
identified forming a solid 7.2 x 6.0 x 5.4 cm mass located in the
pancreatic tail. The tumor extends beyond the pancreas involving
the peripancreatic soft tissue. Angiolymphatic invasion is absent.
Perineural invasion is absent. Tumor necrosis is present. All
surgical resection margins are negative for tumor (minimum tumor
free margin, 2.6 cm, pancreatic body margin). The patient has had
no prior treatment. The adjacent non-neoplastic pancreatic
parenchyma shows focal atrophy. The spleen is unremarkable. A
single (1 of 22) regional lymph node is positive for metastatic
carcinoma.q
Immunoperoxidase studies were performed on paraffin sections of the
pancreatic tail mass using antibodies directed against the following
antigens: Keratin AEI/AE3, 5100 ,CD45, SMA, desmin ,CD30, ALKI. The
neoplastic cells are focally positive for keratin AE 1 /AE3, OSCAR
keratin ,and smooth muscle actin while being negative for S 100,

Comment
The intraductal papillary mutinous neoplasm with high grade dyspiasia is seen to involve the main
pancreatic duct with extension into the side branches- In the area of the Ampulla where the pancreatic
duct enters the duodenum, the neoplastic epithelium is seen to extend into the duodenum- in this
area, also there ismicroscopic invasion of the pancreatic duct wall. However, there is.. not invasion
into the wall of the duodenum..

Gross Des cription
A. Specimen A. is received fresh labeled ""gallbladder.' The specimen consists a club shaped
measuring 7.0 x 4.0 x 2.5 cm. The external surface is gray-tan with a small amount of adherent
fibroadipose tissue. The biLe duct is identified and is probe-patent measuring 0.5 cm in length. On
opening, no calculi is grossly appreciated.. The specimen contains a moderate amount of green
bile. The wall measures 0.2 cm at its greatest thickness. The mucosal surface is green-yellow and
velvet like- No tissue is submitted to the tissue procurement laboratoryr. Representative sections are submitted as Al.
8. Specimen B is received fresh for OR consult labeled ""Whipple specimen, frozen section."" The
specimen consists of the head of the pancreas, a portion of the duodenum, and a portion of the
stomach- The entire specimen measures 21.0 x 7.0 x 3.5 cm. The duodenum measures 14.0 cm in
length. The serosa of the duodenum is gray-tan and somewhat roughened. On opening the
duodenum ,a moderate amount of bile stained material is expelled. No polyps or nodularitiies grossly
appreciated on the mucosal surface- The ampulla of Vater is not prominent- The pancreas measures
5.x 3.5 x 2.5 cm. On palpating the pancreas, a mass is grossly appreciated. The pancreatic duct is
not probe-patent and grossly appears to be involved by tumor. Where the pancreatic duct empties
into the duodenum, the duct grossly presents with a fish-mouth appearance- On sectioning the
pancreas, the mass measures 3.0 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm_ The mass comes to within 1.0 cm of the pancreatic
margin of resection. The mass grossly appears to involve the duodenum and the common bile duct,
but grossly does not appear to extend to the attached stomach. No normal pancreatic parenchyma is
grossly appreciated- The attached stomach measures 7.0 cm along the greater curvature and 4.0 cm
along the: lesser curvature.. The serosa is tan-pink and smooth. Tl rnucosa is tan and exhibits
normal mucosal folds. Sectioning of the attached adipose tissue isolates 3 possible lymph nodes at
the head of the pancreas- No additional lymph nodes are isolated. All attached adipose tissue is
submitted for processing.. A representative section of the tumor is submitted to tissue procurement
laboratory.. Three representative frozen sections are taken and submitted as FSBI.3. Permanent
representative sections are submitted as:

Gross Description
A. The specimen is received fresh for frozen section anal s labeled 'bile duct ,pancreas,
duodenum ""The specimen consists of a rasected portion of the pancreatic head (4.5 x 4.x 3 cm) and
attached duodenum (1.2 cm length and 6 cm in greatest cfrcunsference).. The serosal surface of the
duodenum is brown-tan and smooth .Upon opening ,the Lumen contains a moderate amount of
viscous bile. The mucosal surface of the duodenum exhibits normal folds with no gross evidence
pofyps or nodularity.
The pancreatic margin resection is, marked with tick ink, the portal vein groove is m arked with blue
ink and the retroperitomeal surface is marked with green ink_ There is no stapled line grossly pre sent
that would indicate the superior mesentery artery ...A palpable pancreatic mass is identified. The
pancreatic, duct not probe patent and is totally occluded by the presence of the tumor .Serial
sectioning into the pancreas reveals a firm, yelk w -gray ,ill-defined mass
(4 x 3.5 x 2.5 cm) ,which abuts the retroperitoneal surfaceiuncinate process. Grossly the mass does appear to involve the common bile duct which is probe patent and somewhat dilatedwith an inserted
catheter .Grossly the mass does appear to involve the duodenal wall extending to the mucosal
surface and grossly involving the ampulla of Mater .There is a minimal amount of grossly uninvolved
pancreatic tissue .A section of the minimal amount of attached adipose tissue isolates 2 moderately

A. The specimen is received fresh labeled ""periduodenal nodule""_ The specimen consists of a
single, ovoid, rubbery lymph node measuring up to 12 cm in greatest dimension. There is a moderate
amount of adipose tissue attached to the lymph -node- No tissue was submitted to the Tissue
Procurement Laboratory.. The lymph node is bisected and is submitted entirely in 1 cassette A.
B. The specimen is labeled ""gallbladder""- The specimen consists of a gallbladder which
measures 9.5 x 3.5 x 3..5 cm. The serosa of the gallbladder is pink tan to dusky purple, smooth and
glistening. No transmural perforations are grossly identified- The gallbladder content consists of a
large amount of dark-green viscous bile. No gallstones are grossly identified- The mucosa of the
gallbladder is velvety, dark green. The gallbladder wall is averaging 0.2. cm in thickness. No lymph
nodes are grossly identified attached to the gallbladder neck. No tissue was submitted to the Tissue

lumen.. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted in 2. cassettes, 131 and 132-
C. The specimen is labeled ""retroperitoneal node "".The specimen consists of an irregular,
unoriented fragment of fibroadipose tissue measuring 3 x 2 x 1 cm. The specimen is serially
sectioned to .reveal a single potential lymph node :which measures up to 1.0. cm in greatest dimension.
No tissue was submitted to the Tissue Procurement Laboratory .The specimen is submitted entirely in
4 cassettes ,C1-C4, with potential lymph node in cassette C2.
D. The specimen is labeled ""Whipple, stitch is retroperitoneal margin"". The specimen consists of
a head of pancreas'` x 5 x 3.5 cm), with adjacent portion of duodenum (25 cm in length and up to 3.5
cm in circumference at. the distal resection margins) and distal portion of stomach (7.5 cm in length
and up to 12.0 cm in circumference at the proximal gastric margin). The serosa of the stomach is pink
tan, mildly congested ,smooth, glistening, while the outer surface of the duodenum is shaggy with a
small amount of fibroadipose tissue attached .There is moderate amount of lesser and greater
omental adipose tissue attached to the gastric wall. The pancreatic resection margin reveals a pink
tan, lobulated and grossly unremarkable pancreatic parenchyma. The peripheral aspects of the pancreatic head are composed of a small amount of yellow tan lobulated adipose tissue which is
ranging from 0.1 to 0 .5 cm in thickness .Prior to sectioning the specimen is inked as follows:
Green: Anterior aspect of the pancreatic head
Black: Superior aspect of the pancreatic resection margin
Orange: Inferior aspect luncinate process
Red: Medial aspect
Blue: Retroperitoneal aspect.
On opening the stomach reveals a pink tan, smooth, glistening mucosa which shows preservation of
rugae. Six distal cm of the duodenal mucosa has dusky red color.. The remaining mucosa of the
duodenum is pink tan, smooth, glistening, and has the usual intestinal folds. The ampulla of Water is
slightly prominent and grossly unremarkable- The common bile duct and main pancreatic duct are
grossly unremarkable. On sectioning the pancreatic head reveals a roughly ovoid, well defined,
rubbery tumor mass which measures up to 3.5 x 2.5 x 2 cm. The tumor partially involves uncinate
process and is 0.1 cm from the closest inferior and medial aspects of pancreatic head-, The tumor is
2.8 cm from the pancreatic resection margin, 1.2 cm from the retroperitoneal margin, and 0.5 cm from
anterior aspect of the pancreatic head. The cut surface of the tumor is pink tan, homogenous, without
evidence of necrosis or hemorrhage- The remainder of the pancreatic parenchyma is pink tan,
lobulated, and grossly unremarkable -On sectioning the adipose tissue of the peripheral aspects of
the pancreatic head, several potential lymph nodes are grossly identified whim measure up to 0.2 cm
in greatest dimension- Representative sections of the specimen are submitted for frozen section

COMMENT:
Mitotic figures in this neoplasm appear unusual, including elongated, pyknotic and
popcorn4ike forms, rendering precise mitotic evaluation challenging. Although this neoplasm
is clinically localized at the time of surgical resection, based on the above findings, closer
follow-up I evaluation for metastatic disease will be prudent.

diagnosis.
Gross Description
A.. Specimen A is received fresh for consult, labeled ""distal pancreas and spleen., frozen
The specimen consists of a. reseed distal pa ncreas (6.5 x 4.5 x 3..5 cm), and adjacent
spleen (9.0 x 6.5 x 3.5 cm), and adjacent adipose tissue and omentum (17.0 x 10.0 x 21 cm). The
most distal margin of the spleen stapled .The staples are removed and the closest adjacent
underlying tissue, which reveals the pancreatic duct is submitted for frozen section as F AI.. The
pancreatic duct is probe patent and grossly appears to be free of tumor .No normal pancreatic tissue
is grossly appreciated- A section of the pancreas consists of a firm, gray-tan mass j_..x...x... cm),
which grossly appears to extend to the margin of resection. Crossly, the mass does not extend to the
adjacent spleen. The capsule of the spleen is intact, and the cut. surface is grossly unremarkable.
Sectioning of the adjacent adipose tissue is olatesno definitive lymph nodes. A representative frozen
section is taken and submitted as FSA1. Permanent sections are taken and submitted

Gross Description
A. The specimen is received fresh for OR. consult labeled ""spleen and pancreas (check margin),
frozen section "".The spe cimen consists of a resected portion of the pancreas with adjacent spleen
(14.5 x 9..D .x T.0 cm). The pancreas measures 6.5 x 4.0 x 2..5 cm:). A palpable mass is grossly
appreciated. The overlying tissue is marked with blue ink. Serial sections reveal a partially calcified
brown-tan ill-defined mass (3.0 .x 2.0 x 2.0). The mass is located 4.0 cm from the pancreatic surgical
margin of resection abutting the overlying soft tissue. A portion of the tumor is taken and submitted for
frozen section as FSA:3. The pancreatic margin is removed tangentially and entirety submitted for
frozen sections FSAI and FSA2. The pancreatic duct is propatent and grossly free of tumor. The
remaining pancreatic parenchyma is grossly unremarkable. The attached spleen measures 11 -5 x 6.5
x 5.5 cm. The capsule is red brown and intact. Cut surface exhibits a grossly unremarkable spleen
parenchyma. Adjacent to the tissue is a moderate amount of fat (25.0 x 9_0 x 2.0 cm). A
representative section of the tumor is submitted to the T issue Procurement Laboratory. Permanent

cm), portion: of stomach (3.0 cm on the lesser curvature and 6.5 cm on the greater curvature),
duodenum (11.0 cm in length and 5.0 cm in circumference), and gallbladder (8..5 x 4.0 x 3.5 cm)_
The pancreatic margin of resection is removed and submitted tangentially .The portal vein groove is
marked with -yellow ink, removed and entirely submitted perpendicularly- The superior mesenteric
artery margin resection is marked with black ink, totally removed and entirely submitted
perpendicularly. The retroperitoneal surface marked with blue ink and is entirety submitted
perpendicularly. A palpable pancreatic mass is appreciated. The pancreatic duct is prole patent for
approximately 5 mm and is totally obstructed due to the presence of a firm, gray yellow, ill-defined
pancreatic mass. (4.0 x 3.0 x 2.0 emy The mass is approximately 5 mm from the pancreatic margin of
resection and grossly abuts the portal vein groove and the superior mesenteric artery margin of
resection -Grossly the mass appears to involve the wail of the common bite duct but does not appear
to involve the Ampulla of Vater or duodenum. The remainder of the pancreatic parenchyma is grossly
unremarkable. The duodenum and gastric mucosa exhibits normal mucosal folds with no gross:
evidence of modularity or polypoid lesions -A catheter is inserted in the common bile duct. The
gallbladder is filled with a small :amount of green viscous bite. There is 1 green-yellow calculi present
measuring 1.5 .x.1..0 x 1.0 cm. The rnucosal surface is green yellow and velvet: like. The wall of the
gallbladder ranges: from 0.1 cm to 0.3 cm in thickness On gross: examination, the gallbladder is free
of tumor. A section of the adjacent adipose tissue isolates 2 gray-tan, irregular lymph nodes
measuring 1.5 cm greatest dimension -The lymph nodes are isolated at the pancreas. A

grossly unremarkable spleen (14..0 x 8 - Ox 6. 0 cm). Eoth specimens are adhe rent to a moderate
amount of fat. The pancreatic margin of resection is stapled ..The staples are removed and the
underlying tissue is. removed t angentially and entirely submitted on frozen section as FSB'i. The
pancreatic duct is markedly dilated but is probe- patent for approxima tely 2 cm where it is tiled with a
soft brown tan protruding tissue (possible tumor). The end of the pancreas which attaches to the
spleen is markedly indurated and exhibits a gray white smooth ill-defined mass (3.0 x 2:5 x 2.0 cm)
abutting the soft tissue margin of resection and is approx imately 4 cm from the pancreatic margin of
resection -.The mass at this point totally occludes the pancreatic duct .The mass occupies
approximately 75% of the pancreas. The random pancreatic parenchyma is lobulated gray tan grossly
unremarkable.
The capsule of the spleen is brown tan and intact"" The cut surface exhibits a soft red brown tissue
with grossly unremarkable parenchyma- Sectioning of the adipose tissue isolates no definitive lymph

A. The specimen is received fresh for frozen section analysis, labeled ""fiver nodule-* The
specimen consists of a 1.0 x 0.5 x 0.1 cm, soft, tan-pink irregular fragment of liver, which is entirely
submitted for frozen section as FSAI.
B. The specimen is received fresh for frozen section analysis labeled ""'Whipple ; specimen is
gallbladder, head of pancreas ,distal stomach, and duodenum -""The specimen consists of a resected portion of head of the pancreas (4.0 x 3.0 x 2.5 cm), the duodenum (12 cm in length and 2 cm in its
greatest diameter), distal stomach (3 cm along the lesser curvature and 6.5 cm along the greater
curvature) ,and attached gallbladder (7.0 x 3. 0 x 2.5 cm) ..The landmarks of the specimen are inked
as follows ;superior mesenteric artery stapled margin of resection yellow, portal vein groove blue,. and
retroperitoneal surface black-
The pancreatic duct is probed-patent up to about 2 cm, at which point it appears to be obstructed by
an ill-defined, indurated pancreatic mass 2.0 x 2.0 x 0.3 cm), grossly coming to within 2 cm of the
pancreatic margin of resection, and 0.5 cm of the radial soft tissue margin. Grossly the mass does not
appear to involve the common bile duct, ampulla of Water, or duodenum- The remainder of the

Comment
Sections through the Ampulla show apancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma secondarily involving the
Ampulla and common bile duct- A precursor lesion for the carcinoma is not identified in the Ampulla,
duodenum or bile duct- The carcinoma, however, is centered on the main pancreatic duct. The
adjancet pancreatic parenchyma hsows PanIN 3. These findings support the interpretation of this as a
pancreatic ductal primary, rather than an Ampullary or common bile duct primary-
Ancil lary T esting
lrnmunohistochemiical stains with appropriate controls were performed on block B9.. These results
show strong and diffuse expression for MUC-I, and no expression for MUG-2 and CDX2. These
results are consistent with a pancreatobiliary phenotype.

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: The liver biopsy (Part A) shows preserved lobular parenchyma. The portal tracts are
expanded by a mild inflammatory infiltrate including neutrophils, mild ductular reaction and edema, with mild periportal
fibrosis confirmed on trichrome and reticulin stains. These features are those of bile duct obstruction. No malignancy is
identified. Iron, PAS, DPAS and Victoria blue stains show no additional pathologic features.
The pancreatic gastroduodenectomy specimen (Part B) shows a moderately differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma
arising in the pancreas and extending into the duodenum. There is also extension of tumor into the peripancreatic
adipose tissue. The tumor comes to within 1 mm of the posterior (black inked) surgical margin (Section B9). There is
perineural invasion as well as tumor invasion within lymphatics, confirmed with D2-40 immunohistochemical stain.
There is also multifocal PanIN. In places, there are papillary structures with significant focal atypia, corresponding to
PanIN3 (section B10); these areas are not present at the resection margin. This supports a pancreatic ductal origin for
this tumor.
1 Page 3 of 4 The green cystic lesion noted grossly corresponds to a reactivefinflammatory, partially cystic process adjacent to the
common bile duct. Many spindled macrophages are present in this area, positive for CD68.. No carcinoma is identified
in this area with cytokeratin stain. No metastatic carcinoma is seen in ten lymph nodes.
The gastroduodenal lymph node (Part C) shows a large reactive lymph node with lipogranulomas. No carcinoma is
identified.
The section of jejunum (Part D) shows unremarkable small bowel with a pedunculated lesion on the serosal surface.
This lesion is composed of bland spindle cells arranged in intersecting bundles and fascicles with prominent vascularity.
The cells stain positively for CD117 ( c-kit), and negatively for SMA and desmin .This is consistent with a
gastrointestinal stromal tumor .The gallbladder is partially autolyzed, but otherwise unremarkable.

specimen is totally submitted in blocks Dl and D2,
Container E is additionally labeled ""hepatic artery lymph
nodes."" The container holds an aggregate of tan fibroadipose
soft tissue fragments loosely measuring 3 x 2 x 0.7 cm. Several
firm lymph node fragments are palpated within the specimen. The
specimen is totally submitted in blocks El and E2,
Container F is additionally labeled ""gallbladder."" The container
holds a cholecystectomy specimen measuring 8 x 3.5 x 2.5 cm. The
serosal surface is pink/tan and smooth with a rough liver bed
resection surface. The mucosa is hemorrhagic, velvety and finely
trabeculated. The wall is uniform 0.2 to 0.4 cm in thickness.
There are no stones. There are scant hemorrhagic luminal
contents. No mucosal or mural lesions are noted.
Block summary:
F1 - resection margin with cystic duct and artery and
representative section from fundus
F2 - representative sections from mid body and neck
Container G is additionally labeled ""pancreaticoduodenectomy
with short stitch at uncinate, long stitch at SMA."" The
container holds a standard Whipple specimen with the following
measurements: distal stomach 7.5 x 5 cm; portion of greater
omentum attached to stomach 11 x 4.5 x 1.5 cm; duodenum 24 cm in
length x 2.5 cm in average diameter (after fixation); pancreatic
head and neck 6 x 4.5 x 4.5 cm. A long stitch marks the
pancreatic margin at the SMA and a short stitch marks the
uncinate process margin. Inking: common bile duct=yellow,
resection margin at pancreatic neck=blue, uncinate
process=black, peripancreatic soft tissue=green.
The serosal surface of the stomach and duodenum is tan and
smooth. The pancreatic head is very firm. Opening the duodenum
reveals erythematous coarse and thickened mucosa at the ampulla. The remainder of the stomach and duodenal mucosa is beige/tan,
unremarkable, and appropriately folded. The pancreas is
sectioned revealing a 4.2 x 4.0 x 4.0 cm white/tan/yellow solid
firm mass occupying most of the pancreatic parenchyma in the
specimen. The mass has areas of necrotic cystic change along the
dorsal pancreatic surface. The tumor constricts the common bile
duct to lumen diameter of 1-2 mm. It comes up'into the ampulla
and undermines the duodenal mucosa. The tumor infiltrates into
the duodenal wall proximal to the ampulla as well, extending up
to and possibly into the submucosa. The tumor does not involve
the pylorus. There is relatively poor demarcation between the
mass and the pancreatic neck. To assess distance to pancreatic
neck margin the resection surface of the neck is inked blue and
sections are taken perpendicular to this surface (true surgical
margin at the neck is superseded by the en face G2 section). The
mass extends to the inked uncinate margin at short stitch and
the margin at the SMA at long stitch. It also abuts
peripancreatic soft tissue. Distance to mucosal margins: stomach
margin 16 cm, duodenal margin 13 cm, common bile duct margin 1.5
cm
A number of firm lymph nodes are identified in the
peripancreatic soft tissue ranging in size from 0.2 to 0.6 cm,
submitted per block summary. Tumor was collected by Tissue
Procurement.

- See comment
Comment:
The findings in specimen C may represent an old calcified
granuloma or possibly an area of fat necrosis.
The frozen section slides for specimen D are reviewed and the
frozen section diagnosis confirmed. The atypical cells are seen
only on the permanent sections for specimen D and, later,
invasive carcinoma is seen in the common bile duct margin in
specimen H.
Microscopic examination of specimen I demonstrates liver with
cirrhosis. The dense bands of fibrosis are outlined by trichrome
and reticulin stains. Prominent peri-cellular fibrosis is also
present. Mildly increased hepatocyte iron is seen on iron stain
in hepatocytes and portal tracts. No significant PAS positive
material suggestive of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency seen on
PASD stain, although abundant PAS-positive material is present
in Kupffer cells, consistent with hepatocyte damage. There is
prominent centrilobular cholestasis with feathery degeneration
suggestive of large duct obstruction. There is also focal
ballooning degeneration and macrovesicular steatosis
involving approximately 10% of the hepatic parenchyma with
prominent Mallory' s hyaline. There is bile ductular
proliferation with portal inflammation consisting predominantly
of lymphocytes with focal interface hepatitis. Lobular
inflammation consisting of neutrophils and lymphocytes is also
present.

Comment :
Grossly, a 4.8 cm tumor is identified that is evenly distributed
between the duodenum and head of pancreas. While there are no
available immunohistochemical stains to reliably distinguish a
primary duodenal adenocarcinoma from a pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma, the tumor morphology (glandular structures
with abundant clear to pink apical cytoplasmic mucin) and the
absence of a precursor lesion within the duodenal mucosa both
favor a pancreatic primary.

Gross Description :Whipple
specimen consisting of stomach, measuring 11.2 x 10 x
3.5 cm with a proximal staple line which measures 10.5 cm, duodenum
measuring 28 cm in length x
3.5-4 cm in diameter to distal staple margin and pancreatic head measuring
7.5 x 7 x 5.5 cm. There is a clear tan mucinous material protruding from
the main pancreatic duct at the neck margin, but the main pancreatic duct
remains probe patent. The common bile duct is 0.7 cm in diameter and is
probe patent through the ampulla. The pancreas is serially sectioned to
reveal a main pancreatic duct which is dilated to 3 cm in diameter, with
clear tan-red mucinous mass, measuring 5.5 x 3.5 x 3 cm inside the duct.
The mass is largely mucinous and cystic with some solid papillary areas and
appears to be encapsulated within the duct throughout the pancreas. It is
approximately 0.5 cm from the closest radial margin (anterior medial
margin). There is an adjacent
area of firm tan-white slightly lobular pancreas, possibly consistent with
chronic pancreatitis. The stomach is covered by smooth tan-red serosa and
opened along the greater curvature to reveal unremarkable mucosa. The
duodenum is covered by focal green-yellow discoloration of the proximal
serosa and is opened to reveal 1 mL of blood clot adherent to the ampulla
with possible mucinous material. The ampulla is 12.5 cm from the proximal
stomach margin and 17 cm from the distal duodenal margin. The greater
curvature fat measures 11 x 3.2 x 2 cm and is serially sectioned and palpated to reveal the presence of no obvious lymph nodes. The lesser
curvature fat measures 5.5 x 5 x 2.5 cm and is serially sectioned and
palpated to reveal the presence of six possible lymph nodes. Gross
sectioning and palpation of the peripancreatic fat reveals the presence of
20 possible lymph nodes, the largest of which measures 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm.

Gross Description :C: Pancreatic mass: Received is one Whipple specimen composed of a
stomach (10.3 x 10 x 0.8 (wall thickness) cm), duodenum (25 cm in length x
4 cm in average diameter), gallbladder (11.5 x 4.5 x 2.2 cm), and pancreas
(5.5 x 4.8 x 2.2 cm). The specimen is submitted with five designated
margins. The long single blue suture is tumor invading the superior
mesenteric vein; the looped blue suture identifies the superior mesenteric
artery margin; the looped black suture identifies the deep radial margin;
the long single black stitch identifies the portal vein margin, and the
pair of double black sutures identifies the pancreatic neck margin.
The stomach has a proximal staple line that measures 8 cm in length. It is
inked black and a representative section is submitted. The lesser
curvature measures 7.5 cm in length, and the greater curvature measures
14.5 cm in length. The serosa is tan and mildly rough but unremarkable.
The attached omental fat measures 8.5 cm in greatest length. The specimen
is opened along the lesser curvature to reveal regular rugae covered by
light tan mucus. The mucosa is tan with a slightly nodular appearance
(average 0.4 cm in diameter). Representative sections of stomach are
submitted.
The pancreas has a rough, yellow, partially cauterized exterior. The neck
margin is inked blue, and the remaining radial margins are inked black.
The five sutures are identified. Perpendicular sections of these margins
are submitted. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a white,
ill-defined, indurated mass in the head of the pancreas that extends toI nearly the entire length of the organ. It measures 5 x 3.5 x 2.2 cm. In
the inferior limit, the lesion is surrounded by yellow, partially fibrotic
pancreatic parenchyma. The ampulla is patent to the common bile duct. The
pancreatic main duct is obstructed by the pancreatic mass. However, it is
patent at the pancreatic neck margin. Representative sections are
submitted.
The duodenum has congested red serosa near the pancreas. It is otherwise
unremarkable. The surgical margin is stapled. It is inked black, removed
and submitted. The specimen is opened adjacent to the mesenteric border to
reveal a 1.5-cm open defect with central ulceration that is located between
the pylorus and the ampulla. The ulcer extends into the pancreas. It
measures 1.1 cm in depth from the surface of the mucosa. It erodes nearly
into the proximal limit of the prominent blue metal stent in the ampulla
that measures 1.3 cm in diameter and 1.3 cm in length. The mucosa
surrounding the ulcerative lesion and the proximal area of the stent is
firm with a slight dusky appearance. There is an adjacent mass next to the
ulcer that measures 1.5 x 0.8 cm to a height of 0.9 cm. It bridges between
the ulcer and the stented bile duct. The mucosa distal to the bile duct is
tan and edematous except for the most distal 11 cm of dusky mucosa.
The gallbladder has red-purple serosa with punctate areas of green. The
attached area is rough with a scant amount of cauterized, yellow-lobular
tissue. It is filled with viscous, red-brown fluid. The cystic duct
measures 1.5 cm in length x 0.5 cm in diameter. There is a small duct that
measures 0.3 cm in length x 0.2 cm in diameter 1.3 cm distal to the neck.
This is either one of two candidate hepatic ducts or the cystic artery. Near the insertion of the common bile duct to the pancreas, there is a
circular defect that measures 0.4 cm in diameter. It is not certain if
this is a surgical defect or if this is another candidate hepatic duct
opening. Representative sections are submitted.
Sixteen possible pancreatic lymph nodes are dissected and range in from 0.5
x 0.3 x 0.3 cm to 2.7 x 1 x 1 cm. They are submitted in toto. Six
possible greater curvature nodes are dissected and range from 0.2 x 0.2 x
0.2 cm to 0.8 x 0.6 x 0.6 cm. They are submitted in toto. No duodenal
lymph nodes were found.

Gross Description :D:Whipple (paired silk prior pancreatic margin, long single silk portal
vein, long single blue SMA margin, looped blue suture deep radial margin):TZ- Z)
Received is a Whipple specimen that comprises a pancreas, duodenum, and
gallbladder. The specimen is oriented by the surgeon with a paired silk
suture designated as prior pancreatic margin, a long single silk suture
designated as portal vein, a long single blue suture designated as superior
mesenteric artery margin, and a looped blue suture designated as deep
radial margin.
The pancreas measures 5.5 x 5.5 x 4 cm. The neck margin is inked blue and
the radial margin is inked black. The pancreas is sectioned to reveal an
ill-defined, indurated, white-yellow mass that measures
3 x 3 x 2.7 cm that abuts and possibly invades the common bile duct, is
less than 0.1 cm to the superior mesenteric artery margin, and less than
0.1 cm to the deep radial margin, less than 0.4 cm to the portal vein
margin, and greater than 2 cm from the pancreatic neck margin. The common
bile duct and pancreatic duct are both probe patent. The remaining
pancreatic parenchyma is tan-yellow with normal lobular architecture.
The duodenum measures 19.5 cm in length x 3.3 cm in diameter and has
smooth, red-purple serosa. Both ends are stapled shut. The staples are
inked and opened to reveal a tan-brown mucosal surface with normal
appearing longitudinal folds. The distal 6.5 cm of duodenum is dark brown
and focally hemorrhagic with a slightly dusky appearance. There is an
ill-defined, erythematous lesion at the opening of the pancreatic duct in the duodenum that measures approximately 2 x 1 cm in circumference. The
remaining duodenal mucosa is unremarkable. No other masses or lesions are
identified.
The gallbladder measures 10.2 x 4.2 x 1.6 cm and has a smooth-to-roughened,
red-tan serosal surface. The gallbladder is opened and is filled with
viscous, red-black bile fluid. A cystic duct remnant is identified and
measures 1.5 cm in length x 0.4 cm in diameter. The serosal surface is
bile-stained and grossly unremarkable. In addition, there is a
crystallized calculus, 1.5 cm in greatest dimension, identified. No masses
or lesions are identified.
The pancreatic duct and common bile duct enter the duodenum at different
locations approximately
1.5 cm apart from each other.
Sectioning through the fat closely reveals five possible lymph nodes. The
largest measures
1.5 cm in greatest dimension
Representative sections are submitted.

indurated mass 3 cm proximal to the ampulla. The proximal duodenal margin is removed entirely en
face and used for frozen section diagnosis and is resubmitted in toto. The pancreas measures 5.8 x 4 x 4
cm. The neck margin is inked blue, and the radial margin is inked black. On sectioning, a 4 x 3.8 x 3-cm,
ill-defined, indurated, white-yellow mass with clear tan, mucinous filled cystic spaces is identified in the
head of the pancreas ,0.6 cm to the neck
margin, approximately 0.2 cm to the ampulla, and focally abuts the Qq L'VY7 lel_-jL1&AJ_)q&13black -inked radial margin ,and grossly extends to the proximal duodenal
margin.
The ill-defined mass surrounds the main pancreatic and common bile ducts;
however, both ducts are probe patent through the ampulla. The common bile
duct contains a blue stent. The ducts appear to enter the duodenum via
adjacent but separate ductal ampullae. Common bile duct at the margin is
dilated at 1 cm in diameter. The main pancreatic duct at the neck margin
is dilated up to 0.6 cm in diameter.
Sectioning through the mass into the duodenum proximal to the ampulla
reveals the mass to extend grossly into the muscularis of the duodenum and
a clear, mucinous, fluid-filled space, 1.4 cm in greatest dimension,
subjacent to the flattened duodenal mucosal area.
Sectioning and palpation of the peripancreatic fat reveals 14 possible
lymph nodes ranging in size from 0.3 cm in greatest dimension up to 1.2 cm
in greatest dimension. Additionally noted is a 4.2 x 3.2 x 0.6-cm, lymph
node versus splenule. All possible lymphoid tissue is submitted.
Representative sections of the largest lymph node versus splenule areld/^

Gross Description :Whipple, FS: Received is a pancreaticoduodenectomy specimen that
consists of duodenum, pancreas, and peripancreatic fat. The duodenum
measures 20.5 cm in length x 4 cm in average diameter. Both ends are
received stapled shut. The serosa is smooth, red, and grossly unremarkable.
The staples are removed and the duodenum is opened to reveal uniformly
dusky brown mucosa in the distal one-third of the specimen. Of note, the
common bile duct and the main pancreatic ducts have two separate ampullae
separated by approximately 0.2 cm. There is a 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.2-cm,
granular, red-tan lesion adjacent to the ampullae. The proximal duodenal
mucosa is significant for several punctate hemorrhages. There is a blue
stent protruding through the common bile duct ampulla.
The pancreas measures 10 x 6 x 4 cm. The specimen is oriented as follows:
looped blue at portal vein groove, long blue stitch at superior mesenteric
artery margin, and long single black stitch at deep radial margin. The
entire radial margin of the pancreas is inked black. The neck is shaved en
face and used for frozen section diagnosis and is resubmitted in toto. The
new ""untrue"" pancreatic neck margin is inked orange for orientation. The
specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a 3.8 x 3 x 3-cm, ill-defined,
indurated, yellow-white mass that focally abuts the black-inked radial
margin and grossly extends into the peripancreatic fat. The mass is 0.6 cm
from the pancreatic neck margin and 0.5 cm from the ampulla. In the mid
portion of the specimen, the mass surrounds and compresses the main
pancreatic duct to a diameter of 0.1. The main pancreatic duct is probe patent through the ampulla. Similarly, the mass centrally compresses the
common bile duct that is probe patent, through the blue stent, to the
ampulla. Distally, both the main pancreatic and the common bile ducts are
dilated. A portion of the tumor is sent to tumor bank and
The peripancreatic fat is carefully dissected to reveal 12 possible lymph
nodes. Representative sections are submitted including all possible lymph
nodes.

Gross Description :Pancreas: Received is a Whipple specimen measuring 17 x 8 x 5 cm,
consisting of duodenum (15 cm in length x 4.5 cm depth) and pancreas (8 x
5.4 x 2 cm). The proximal and distal margins of the duodenum are received
closed. The duodenum is opened to reveal a duodenal mucosa with normal
folding pattern, with the more distal portion of the duodenal mucosa
appearing darker and congested. Additionally, there is a wire mesh stent
protruding from the ampulla for a distance of 1.2 cm.
The pancreas is received with multiple surgical stitchs, a long single
black stitch designates the deep radial margin, a long single blue stitch
designates the portal vein margin, a looped blue stitch designates the
superior mesenteric artery margin, and a looped black stitch designates the
proximal duodenal margin. The proximal duodenal margin near the area of
the looped black stitch is removed and submitted for frozen section. This
tissue is resubmitted entirely. The pancreatic neck margin measures 1.6 x
1.5 cm and is inked orange. The vascular groove is inked blue and the
remaining radial pancreatic margin is inked black. The pancreas is
serially sectioned to reveal a pale tan to white mass that measures 2.7 x
2.2 x 1.6 cm. The mass is 1.4 cm from the SMA margin, 1.2 cm from the
portal vein margin, 3 cm from the deep radial margin, and 1 mm from the
nearest radial margin. The common bile duct is identified and has a
diameter of 0.2 cm. Additionally, the common bile duct is probe patent
through the ampulla. A longitudinal cut is made along the common bile duct
to reveal the aforementioned wire mesh stent. The stent measures 6.3 cm in length and has a diameter of 1.2 cm. A probe is inserted into the main
pancreatic duct at pancreatic neck margin. The main pancreatic duct is not
probe patent and a longitudinal cut made along the duct determines the
lumen is being obstructed by the mass. Of note, representative sections
and frozens were taken of the common bile duct margin, pancreatic margin,
and duodenal margin and are resubmitted entirely. The remainder of the
pancreatic parenchyma is firm, pale tan to yellow with no additional
distinct masses or lesions noted.

Gross Description :Whipple (long black stitch = pancreatic duct margin, blue stitch =
portal vein margin, looped blue = SMA, looped black = deep radial margin):
The specimen consists of a portion of duodenum measuring 22 cm in length x
4 cm in outer diameter with adhered pancreatic tissue measuring 12 x 8 x 5
cm. The pancreatic tissue has a portal vein vascular groove measuring 10
cm in length which is designated by the long single blue stitch. The
proximal duodenal staple line measures 6 cm in length, with adhered
pancreatic tissue within 0.5 cm of the surgical staple line and adhered
pancreatic tissue extending down the length of the pancreatic duodenal
junction. The distal staple line measures 5 cm in length. The pancreatic
duct margin is marked with a long black stitch and is shaved en face for
frozen section (El). Additionally there is a looped blue surgical stitch
designating the SMA margin and a looped black stitch designating the deep
radial margin. The main pancreatic duct measures 0.5 cm in diameter, and
is hemorrhagic in appearance. After the sample is taken for frozen
section, the residual pancreatic neck margin is inked orange, the vascular
groove is inked blue, and the remaining radial margin is inked black. The
common bile duct diameter measures 0.7 cm and a metal surgical stent is in
place extending down through the ampulla into the duodenum. The cystic
duct is identified and is probe patent to the common bile duct. The distal
duodenal margin is inked black as well as the proximal duodenal margin
which are shaved, and the duodenum is opened longitudinally to reveal a
dusky tan-brown mucosal surface with normal appearing folds. There is aID
cl^
0 small segment of pylorus at the proximal margin measuring 1 cm in length.
Additionally there is a small polyp measuring 0.8 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm,
approximately 1 cm away from the distal margin. Additionally approximately
2 cm from the ampulla there is a small 0.3 x 0.3 cm polyp.
The pancreas is serially sectioned to reveal a 6 x 6 x 3 cm lesion with a
tan-white-to-yellow cut surface with several areas of possible necrosis.
The lesion extends up to but not through both the vascular groove margin
and the deep radial margin and comes to within 0.3 cm of the new pancreatic
neck margin. Additionally the lesion appears to be grossly encompassing
the main pancreatic duct as well as the common bile duct. There is a small
amount of residual lobular tan-yellow pancreatic tissue nearest to the
proximal duodenal margin. No other abnormalities or satellite lesions are
identified.
There is a small amount of peripancreatic adipose tissue, which is palpated
for lymph nodes and all possible lymph nodes are submitted

The stage is determined based on the AJCC 7th Edition criteria, where pT(x) indicates that the primary tumor size cannot be assessed, pN1 denotes regional lymph node involvement, and pM is not applicable as there is no mention of distant metastasis in the report. The grade is reported as poorly differentiated based on the histologic features mentioned in the report.",,,

Gross Description :Received is 1 specimen with pancreatic and duodenal tissue
with several sutures present. The duodenum measures 19 cm in length x 3.2
cm in diameter. The serosal surface is smooth, glistening, tan-pink with
cautery artifact. The duodenum is opened longitudinally to reveal
tan-brown mucosa with an ampulla that is 5 cm from the proximal margin, and
is surrounded by a 1.7 x 1 cm red-tan ulcerative lesion.
The pancreas measures 7.5 x 6 x 4.5 cm, and the neck margin is removed en
face and submitted for frozen section diagnosis. The pancreas is sectioned to reveal that the major
pancreatic duct
is obstructed approximately 1.5 cm from the neck margin. There is an
ill-defined, indurated, white-yellow lesion that is 2 x 2.5 x 2.3 cm. The
mass possibly invades the common bile duct, which is friable and
hemorrhagic, and dilated to 1.2 cm in diameter. The common bile duct is
patent through the ampulla. The mass is 1 cm to the neck margin, 0.8 cm to
the long blue (portal vein), 2.8 cm to the long black (SMA), 0.6 to looped
black (deep radial), 0.1 cm to nearest radial margin, and 6 cm to the

Diagnosis
Distal pancreas and spleen, excision -
Poorly differentiated pancreatic adenocarcinoma, extending into
peripancreatic soft tissues (see microscopic description).
Carcinoma extends at least near to outer resection margin, but not
definitively identified at outer margin. Proximal margin negative for
high-grade dysplasia and carcinoma (see microscopic description).
Spleen without specific diagnostic abnormalities.
Metastatic adenocarcinoma in one of twelve (1/12) lymph nodes.
Microscopic Description:
The following template summarizes the findings in this case:
Histologic type: Adenocarcinoma. The specimen also has dilated ducts
lined by mucinous epithelium, including in the grossly separate cyst
submitted in blocks A3 & A4, compatible with (branch duct-type)
intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN). See note below.
Histologic grade: Poorly differentiated
Primary tumor: pT3.Carcinoma extends intoperipancreatic soft

Yu
Margins of resection: Carcinoma extends at least near to the inked
outer margin, but is not definitively identified at this margin. There
is IPMN at the proximal margin, but it appears low grade at the margin,
without high grade dysplasia or carcinoma identified at the proximal
margin.
Regional lymph nodes: pNl .There is metastatic adenocarcinoma in one
of twelve (1/12) lymph nodes, with the positive lymph node in block
#14.
Distant metastasis: Not applicable
Vascular invasion: Not definitively identified
Other findings: There is perineural invasion by carcinoma, including in
areasthat grossly appeared normal (block #5). The spleen is without
specific diagnostic abnormalities.
Note: It is uncertain if the poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma has
arisen from the IPMN, or if the IPMN is an incidental finding in the
background. This case has been reviewed in Intradepartmental
Consultation, with essential concurrence with the interpretation, with
most reviewers favoring the IPMN is incidental.

Clinical Information
PRE-OP DIAGNOSIS: Pancreatic cancer Gross Description
Received fresh in a container labeled ""distal pancreas, spleen"" is a 9
x 5.5 x 3.5 cm portion of distal pancreas, which attached 110 g, 10 x
7.8 x 3.5 cm, spleen. The surface of the spleen is gray-tan and
wrinkled, and on cut surface it is dark red, smooth, and glistening,
with diffuse white stippling, without gross abnormality. There are a
few areas on the hilar surface of the spleen, approximately 2 cm in
greatest dimension, where the capsule is absent. The pancreas has a
stapled margin proximally. The staples are removed and this surface is
inked black. The remainder of the surface of the pancreas is inked
blue. A firm masscan be palpated from the outer aspect of the
specimen. The specimen is sectioned, and there is a white-tan ill
circumscribed mass 4.5 x 3.7 x 2.7 cm. The mass is 3 cm from the
proximal resection margin, and 3.5 cm from the spleen. The pancreatic
duct can be traced on cut surface to the tumor, but cannot be probed.
The pancreatic duct appears to be markedly stenotic and possibly
obliterated through the area of the tumor. The pancreatic duct lining
is inked green for identification purposes. There is some residual
normal appearing tan pancreatic tissue grossly identified outside of
the mass. There is an apparent cystic structure near, but not clearly
at, the proximal margin of the specimen, 0.7 cm in greatest dimension.
This cyst is 0.2 cm from the pancreatic duct. There are a few tan
lymph nodes identified in the surrounding adipose tissue. RS-15,
following fixation.
BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 - vascular margin; 2 - spleen; 3,4 - entire pancreatic
cyst, with block 3 including adjacent pancreatic duct margin; 5 -
grossly normal pancreatic tissue; 6-11 - tumor, including relation to
the pancreatic duct and outer margin; 12-14 - lymph nodes; 15 -
additional tissue from proximal pancreatic margin.

F/S TAT: 33 mins.
Gross Description:
Received are four containers, all labeled with the patient's name
Part A is received fresh for frozen section diagnosis and additionally labeled
'Whipple specimen, long black=uncinate, short black=pancreatic neck, blue=bile
duct.""
Specimen (components and dimensions): The specimen is the product of a Whipple
resection, previously sectioned, consisting of a 13.2 x 3.0 cm duodenum with
pancreatic head 4.7 cm in length and additional dimensions of 5.6 x 5.5 cm.
Gallbladder: The gallbladder is submitted as a separate specimen (see part
B).
Specimen inking pattern: Uncinate/retroperitoneal/posterior black, vascular
groove red, anterior-blue. (Please note the specimen has been previously inked
in focal areas: The bile duct inked blue, uncinate inked yellow, neck inked
black.)
Tumor:
Location: Pancreatic head
Size: 3.1 x 2.1 x 1.1 cm
Appearance: The tumor is white-tan to tan with ill defined borders and a
decrease in lobular architecture. The tumor is also firm. Gross impression of invasive growth: There is a biliary stent present in the
bile duct. After removal, the tumor appears to abut and obstruct the bile duct.
The tumor appears to possibly abut the main pancreatic duct, however, there does
not appear to be any gross involvement and the pancreatic duct is of the usual
caliber. The tumor also appears to abut, but not grossly penetrate through the
vascular groove. Please defer to microscopic diagnosis.
Resection margins (closest):
Proximal duodenum or stomach: 2.1 cm
Distal duodenum: 7.4 cm
Bile duct: 2.9 cm
Pancreatic neck/duct: 2.3 cm
Uncinate/Retroperitoneum: 1.1 cm
Other findings: The attached portion of duodenum has a pink-tan to brown,
smooth and roughened serosal surface. There'appears to be a 1.1 x 0.8 cm
transmural defect located 5.4 cm from the proximal end. Upon opening the
duodenum, the mucosa is pink-tan with the normal mucosal folds. The area of
transmural defect seems to the area opposing where the bile duct stent was
located .This could be a possible area of local trauma .There are two lesions
present on the duodenal mucosal surface. The first lesion is approximately 2.6
cm from the proximal duodenal margin. This lesion is concerning for possible
tumor. The lesion appears separate from the ampulla, located on the posterior
wall of the duodenum. This lesion has dimensions of 1.4 x 1.4 x 0.4 cm. The
lesion is pink-tan with raised borders with a central ulcerated area.
Representative sections of the first lesion are placed in cassettesAl 4 and Al 5.
The second lesion in the duodenum is approximately 4.6 cm from the proximal
surface, also located on the posterior wall of the duodenum. This lesion has
dimensions of 1.4 x 1.3 x 0.8 cm. This lesion is pink-tan with a smooth surface.
The cut surface of this lesion is yellow-tan and homogeneous. Representative
sections of this lesion are placed in cassettes Al 6 and All.
The bile duct is removed and submitted for frozen section diagnosis (FSA1). The
tissue is resubmitted for permanent section in cassette Al. The uncinate margin
is shaved off and submitted for frozen section diagnosis (FSA2 )and this tissue
is resubmitted for permanent section in cassette A2. The pancreatic neck is
shaved off and submitted for frozen section diagnosis (FSA3 )and this tissue is
resubmitted for permanent section in cassette A3.

Part B is received in formalin additionally labeled ""gallbladder"" and consists
of a gallbladder with overall dimensions of 5.9 x 2.5 x 1.7 cm. The surface is
purple-tan, smooth to roughened. There is a pericystic duct lymph node
identified, having a greatest dimension of 0.6 cm. Opening of the gallbladder
reveals a moderate amount of yellow-green markedly viscid bile. There are no
choleliths identified. The mucosa is pink-tan to brown with focal yellow
stippling. The thickness of the gallbladder wall is 0.3 cm. The cystic duct is
probe patent and appears slightly thickened. The usual sections are submitted in
a single cassette to include the pericystic duct lymph node.
Part C is received in formalin additionally labeled ""portal lymph node"" and
consists of one pink-tan irregular fragment of soft tissue, having dimensions of
1.3 x 0.8 x 0.3 cm. The specimen is submitted in toto in cassette C.
Part D is received in formalin additionally labeled ""SMA tissue"" and consists of
two pink-tan irregular fragments of soft tissue, having dimensions of 1.6 x 0.7

END OF REPORT
Taken: DOB: Gender: M"," Site: Pancreas, Duodenum, Gallbladder, and Multiple Lymph Nodes
Laterality: Not provided
Histology: Adenocarcinoma involving pancreas and duodenum, adenoma of gallbladder
Stage: Not determined in the report
Grade: Not provided
Behavior: Malignant (due to the presence of invasive adenocarcinoma)

Justification: The report mentions ""representative sections of tumor"" and ""mass to vascular groove,"" indicating a malignant process, likely adenocarcinoma, in the pancreas. Additionally, the duodenal lesion is described as having a cut surface that is yellow-tan and homogeneous, which can also be indicative of neoplasia or malignancy. The gallbladder contains a moderate amount of markedly viscid bile, which could suggest the presence of a pathological process such as cholecystitis or a gallbladder tumor. However, the report does not provide enough information to determine the stage or grade of these lesions.",,,
