(C) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES:
PROSTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA, GLEASON SCORE 7 (4+3) (SEE COMMENT).
TUMOR EXTENDING FOCALLY INTO EXTRAPROSTATIC TISSUE.
Margins of resection free of tumor.
Right and left seminal vesicles ,no tumor present.
Segments of right and left vasa deferentia ,no tumor present.
PERINEURAL INVASION PRESENT.
No lymphovascular invasion identified.
PROSTATIC INTRAEPITHELIAL NEOPLASIA (PIN), HIGH GRADE.
COMMENT
The prostate gland contains two foci of prostatic adenocarcinoma .Both tumor foci are located in the peripheral zone. The
dominant tumor focus is located in the left lateral ,left posterolateral and left posterior peripheral zone .This tumor focus measures.
1.8 x 1.2 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension, and it is present in the three cross sections of the prostate ,focally in the
apex and extensively in the base .In the left superior neurovascular bundle region ,this tumor focus extends focally (less than 2.0
mm) into extraprostatic tissue. The margins of resection are free of tumor .The second tumor focus is located in the right lateral
and right posterolateral peripheral zone .This tumor focus measures 1.1 x 0.3 cm in the largest cross -sectional dimension, and it
is present in the last cross section of the prostate and focally in the base .This tumor focus is of lower histologic grade and
confined to the prostate .Allmargins of resection are free of tumor.
GROSS DESCRIPTION
(C) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A specimen consisting of a prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles and
attached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.
The prostate gland (4.0 x 2.7 x 4.2 cm, 35. 0 grams ,post-fixation )has the usual shape. The soft tissue present along the
posterolateral aspects of the prostate is scant and symmetrical .An area of firmness is noted on the left base of the prostate.
Serial cross sections after fixation demonstrate an area consistent with tumor in the left side of the three cross sections of the
prostate.
The seminal vesicles and segments of vasa deferentia are grossly free of tumor.

NOTE: The urothelial carcinoma is composed of two components; one with morphologic features of 
small cell carcinoma and the other with glandular differentiation with mucinous features. The 
carcinomas seen in the urinary bladder and prostate are cyto-/ histomorphologically different and exhibit 
features consistent with their primary anatomic locations. The prostatic carcinoma is seen in four out of 
fifteen tissue sections (about 5-10% of the evaluated prostatic tissue). Dr. has seen representative 
slides of this case and agreed. Verbal report was given to Dr.

SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT
FINAL PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS
fIy
A.Anterior prostatic fat, biopsy :Benign vascular fibroadipose tissue ,no tumor, no
epithelium.
B.Posterior bladder margin ,biopsy :Prostatic adenocarcinoma ,Gleason score
4+4=8, in fibroadipose tissue ,nerve, ganglia and suspicious for lymphatic invasion.
C. Posterior peritoneum ,biopsy: Benign peritoneal tissue and fibroadipose tissue, no
tumor.
D. Right pelvic lymph nodes ,dissection :Two benign lymph nodes ,no tumor (0/2).
E.Left pelvic lymph nodes, dissection: No tumor in five lymph nodes (0/5).
F.Prostate gland ,bilateral seminal vesicles, prostatectomy :Prostatic
adenocarcinoma ,Gleason score 5+4 = 9, with florid extraprostatic extension and
bilateral seminal vesicle invasion ,at three different inked resection margins; see
comment.
COMMENT:
This case was amended onto add results of additional tissue submitted for part D. At the
request of the clinician ,the remainder of parts D and E were submitted to evaluate for the presence of
additional lymph nodes ,and one additional lymph node without tumor was identified .This is now
reflected in the gross description (allmaterial of parts D and E now submitted ,with additional blocks D2
and D3 ,and E2 ),and in the final diagnosis where and additional lymph node of part D is without tumor,
and in the comment where total number of lymph nodes present in changed from 6 to 7. No other
changes were made to this report.
The majority of the prostatic tissue (>85%) is involved by high-grade small acinar adenocarcinoma. PIA,Ti,S r NoIneAsta f (' ctrl `I tlrM01V
Only scant residual benign prostate is seen ,and while all of this appears atrophic suggestive of
preoperative hormone deprivation therapy ,the tumor shows recognizable areas of Gleason patterns 3, 4
and 5 tumor ,and therefore a grade is still reported .Three different margins have tumor at ink that are
all in areas of extraprostatic extension ;left anterior apex (at lest 3mm ,slides F4 ,F14), left posterior
quadrant along posterior seminal vesicle (scattered microscopic foci, slides F13 ,F20), and right bladder
resection margin (1mm slide F17). However ,extensive cautery artifact precludes the grading of the
carcinoma at these margins .In addition ,tumor is present in adipose tissue and nerve of the separate
specimen named ""posterior bladder margin "" (Slide BI ),but no tumor is seen in the smooth (detrusor)
muscle of this specimen .Extensive involvement of both the right and left seminal vesicles is also
observed ,as well as florid extraprostatic extension ,the largest contiguous of such being at least 2cm
(left Base).
Synoptic Comment for Prostate Tumors
- Type of tumor: Small acinar adenocarcinoma.
- Location of tumor: Throughout entire prostate, most extensive posteriorly, and on the left (right
anterior base apparently contains less tumor).
- Estimated volume of tumor :As tumor is almost completely replacing (at least 85%) this 40 gram
prostate, tumor volume is at least 30cc.
-Gleason score :5+4; primary pattern 5, secondary pattern 4.
-Estimated volume > Gleason pattern 3 :Greater than 90%.
-Involvement of capsule :Present, numerous areas.
- Extraprostatic extension :Present, extensive, multiple areas, largest contiguous area at least 2cm
(left base).
- Margin status for tumor :Positive (at least 3mm left anterior apex, slides F4, F14; left posterior
base, slides F13, F20 right bladder margin (slide F17). Gleason pattern at largest positive margin:
Grading is precluded by extensive cautery artifact, but appears high grade (4 or 5).
-Margin status for benign prostate glands :None present.
-High-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN ):Present; focally.
- Tumor involvement of seminal vesicle :Present; both sides.
-Perineural Infiltration :Present, extensive.
-Lymph node status :Negative; total number of nodes examined: 7.
- A3CC/UICC stage :pT3bNOR1 (If the patient did receive adequate/appropriate neoadjuvant ADT
course, the grade would be ypT3bNOR1; correlate with clinical history).

Clinical History
The patient is a -year-old man who per the electronic medical record has a PSA of
ho was found to have prostatic adenocarcinoma, Gleason 4 + 4 ( see prior report
He now undergoes a robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy and bilateral
pelvic lymph node dissection.
Gross Description
The specimen is received in six parts, each labeled with the patient's name and medical record number.
Parts A-E are all received in formalin. Part F is received fresh.
Part A is additionally labeled ""anterior prostatic fat,"" and consists of two soft, irregular ,unoriented,
tan-yellow fibrofatty tissue fragments (4.5 x 3.7 x 0.6 cm in aggregate ).No nodules or masses are
palpated .Representative sections are submitted in cassette Al. Part B is additionally labeled ""posterior bladder margin ,""and consists of a single firm, unoriented,
tan-white tissue fragment (1.3 x1 x 0.4 cm ).The specimen is entirely submitted in cassette B1.
Part C is additionally labeled ""posterior peritoneum ,""and consists of a single soft, irregular, unoriented
tan-white to yellow -brown tissue fragment (3.1 x 1. 6 x 0.3 cm ).One side is smooth, shiny and

Part C i s additionally labeled ""prostate and seminal vesicles ,""and consists of a radical prostatectomy
specimen (52 gm ;4 cm from apex to base x 4.7 cm from lateral to medial x 4 cm from anterior to
posterior).
GROSS PATHOLOGIC FINDINGS :There are two suspicious areas .The first suspicious area is tan -yellow
(1.2 x 1 x 1 cm), located abutting into the margin inked black (less than 0.1 cm ),also located in serial
slices 5 ,6 and 7. The second suspicious area is tan -white (1.2 x 1 x 0 .6 cm), located within 0.4 cm
from the right anterior inked green margin ,and also located in serial slices 2 and 3.The remaining
prostate parenchyma is tan -light brown .The seminal vesicle /vas deferens bundles (right 2 .5 x 1.5 x
0.5 cm ;left 2 x 1 .5 x 0.5 cm) are soft ,lobulated ,red-tan ,without obvious lesions or mass .Some of
the prostate is taken by the , (serial slice 6 and anterior half of slice 7).

DIAGNOSIS
(C) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES:
PROSTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA, GLEASON SCORE 9 (5+4) (SEE COMMENT).
MULTIFOCAL EXTRAPROSTATIC EXTENSION PRESENT.
TUMOR INVADING RIGHT AND LEFT SEMINAL VESICLES AND PERIVESICULAR SOFT TISSUE.
TUMOR EXTENDING IN MULTIPLE AREAS TO THE MARGIN OF RESECTION.
SEE PREVIOUS REPORT FOR DIAGNOSIS OF PELVIC LYMPH NODES.
COMMENT
Approximately 90% of the prostate gland is involved by prostatic adenocarcinoma. There are two tumor foci, one of peripheral
zone and one of transition zone origin. The dominant tumor focus is located in the right anterolateral, right lateral, right
posterolateral, right posterior, mid posterior, left posterior, left posterolateral, left lateral and left anterolateral peripheral zone with
extension into the transition zone. This tumor focus measures 4.0 x 3.0 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and it is
present in three cross sections and extensively in the apex and base regions. This tumor focus exhibits multifocal extraprostatic
extension and multifocal extension to the margin of resection. This tumor focus extensively invades both seminal vesicles
including intra and extraprostatic portions and perivesicular soft tissue. The second tumor focus is located in the right and left
transition zone. This tumor focus measures 2.0 x 1.0 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in three cross
sections, extensively in the apex and focally in the base region. This tumor focus is of lower histologic grade (Gleason score
6/3+3) and it is confined to the prostate.
Please refer to the previous report for the diagnosis of the pelvic lymph nodes.
GROSS :DESCRIPTION
(C) PROSTATE, SEMINAL VESICLES - A prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles and attached segments of right and
left vasa deferentia.
The prostate gland (5.3 x 3.5 x 3.6 cm, 56 gm, postfixation) has the usual shape. A nodule is palpated in the right mid and
right base regions. Serial cross sections after fixation demonstrate a firm area consistent with tumor in the right peripheral zone
involving the three cross sections of the prostate.
The seminal vesicles and segments of vasa deferentia are grossly free of tumor.

The specimen is inked as follows: Anterior-Orange, Posterior-Black, Apex-Red, Base-Blue, Right­
Green, and Left-Yellow. After removal of the apex and base, the remaining prostate weight is 29g. The 
specimen is serially sectioned from apex to base to reveal firm tan fibrous parenchyma. No obvious 
lesions or nodules are grossly identified. The attached right and left seminal vesicles are 2.5 x 1.5 x 
a.8cm and 3 x 2.5 x 1cm, respectively, are sectioned to beige tan cystic tissue with no gross evidence 
of tumor involvement. The attached right and left segments of vas deferens are 1.3 x a.6cm and 1.2 x

* Site: The site of the cancer is not explicitly mentioned in the report. However, it can be inferred to be the breast based on the context.
* Laterality: The laterality (left or right side) of the breast is also not provided in the report.
* Histology: The histology of the tumor is invasive ductal carcinoma, which means the cancer has developed from the milk ducts and has invaded the surrounding tissue.
* Stage: The stage of the cancer is T2N1M0, which indicates that the tumor is greater than 2 cm in size, has spread to at least one axillary lymph node, but has not yet metastasized to other parts of the body.
* Grade: The grade of the cancer is not provided in the report. However, it can be inferred that it is a high-grade tumor based on the fact that it has invaded the surrounding tissue.
* Behavior: The behavior of the cancer is malignant, meaning it is capable of spreading to other parts of the body and causing harm.

The reason for the discrepancy between pathology and radiology reports could be due to differences in interpretation or measurement of the tumor size, location, and involvement of lymph nodes. Without access to both reports, it is difficult to provide a definitive justification for the discrepancy.",,,,

COMMENT
Approximately 90% of the prostate is occupied by prostatic adenocarcinoma. The tumor measures approximately 4.0 x 3.0 cm in
the largest cross sectional dimension and it is present in the three cross sections of the prostate and extensively in the apex and
base regions. The tumor exhibits multifocal extraprostatic extension. The tumor invades both seminal vesicles including intra and
extraprostatic portions. In the base region, in the periurethral region, focal extension of tumor to the margin cannot be excluded.Additional sections were examined.
Please refer to the previous report for the diagnosis of the pelvic lymph nodes.
GROSS DESCRIPTION
(C) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A specimen consisting of a prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles andattached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.
The prostate gland (6.0 x 4.2 x 3.7 cm, 53 grams, post fixation) has the usual shape. The soft tissue present along the left
posterolateral aspect of the prostate appears more abundant than along the right side. The prostate is diffusely firm, particularlyon the left side including the left seminal vesicle.
SECTION CODE: C1-C3, right seminal vesicle and segment of right vas deferens from the base towards the tip; C4-C8,
left seminal vesicle and segment of left vas deferens from the base towards the tip; C9, C10, prostatic base, right border;
C11-C15, prostatic base, right posterior border; C16-C23, prostatic base, central portion; C24, prostaticbase , left border;C25-C27, prostatic base, left posterior border; C28-C30, apex anterior; C31, C32, apex left; C33-C37, apex posterior; C38-C40,
apex right; C41, C42, detached portions of margin of resection according to specimen radiograph; C43-C55, sections of the four
cross sections of the prostate according to specimen radiograph.
The anterior aspect of the prostate is inked in green, left surface in red, right surface in yellow and posterior surface inblack.Orange ink (C45-C47, C50, C54 and C55) denotes surfaces that do not represent the true margin of resection.

COMMENT
The prostate gland contains a single focus of prostatic adenocarcinoma. The tumor is located in the right posterolateral, right
posterior, mid posterior, and left posterior peripheral zone. The tumor focus measures 2.5 x 0.9 cm in the largest cross-sectional
dimension, and it is present in the three cross sections of the prostate, extensively in the apex and focally in the base region. The
tumor is confined to the prostate. The margins of resection are free of tumor.
GROSS DESCRIPTION
(D) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A specimen consisting of a prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles and
attached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.
The prostate gland (5.2 x 2.5 x 3.8 cm, 36 grams, post-fixation) has the usual shape. The soft tissue present along the
posterolateral aspect of the prostate is abundant and more extensive along the right side. An area of firmness is noted on the
midline posterior surface of the prostate. Serial cross sections after fixation demonstrate an area of tumor in the mid posterior
region of the two cross sections of the prostate.
The seminal vesicles and segments of vasa deferentia are grossly free of tumor.
SECTION CODE: D1-D3, right seminal vesicle and segment of right vas deferens from the base towards the tip; D4, D5,
left seminal vesicle and segment of left vas deferens from the base towards the tip; D6, prostatic base right border; D7-D9,
prostatic base right posterior border; D10-D12, prostatic base central portion; D13, D14, prostatic base left border; D15, D16,
prostatic base left posterior border; D17, D18, apex anterior; D19, D20, apex left; D21, D22, apex posterior; D23, D24, apex right;
D25-D36, sections of the three cross sections of the prostate according to specimen radiograph.
The anterior aspect of the prostate is inked in green, left surface in red, right surface in yellow and posterior surface in
black. Blue ink (D7, 8, 10-12, 19-24, 27, 28, 32 and 36) and orange ink (D31) denote surfaces that do not represent a true margin
of resection. Two blocks (D25 and 29) submitted for decalcification.

Review of the electronic medical recordindicates the patient Is a'^ an
with a history of prostate cancer by core biopsy ,Gleason 's grade from 3+3 (6) to 3+4 (7). He now
undergoes a radical robot -assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy with bilateral pelvic lymph node
dissection.
Gross Description
The specimen is received in five parts ,each labeled with the patient 's name and medical record number.
Part A is received fresh, while Parts B-E are received in formalin.
Part A is additionally labeled ""prostate and seminal vesicles .""It consists of a large ,intact prostate
gland with attached seminal vesicle /vas deferens bundles ,weighing 44 gm and measuring 3.8 cm from
apex to base ,6 cm from medial to lateral ,and 3 .3 cm from anterior to posterior .The exterior of the
specimen Is roughened ,red-tan ,and glistening .A single line of small ,silver -gray laparoscopic staples
closes the dorsal vein complex .The bladder margin demonstrates extensive cautery markings. The
seminal vesicle /vas deferens bundles are small, soft ,and whorled ,without obvious mass or lesion. The
right anterior and lateral aspect of the mid gland through base is somewhat soft to palpation .The left
lateral aspect from apex through mid gland is firm to palpation .The right anterior surface of the gland
is inked in green ,the left anterior surface is inked in blue ,and the posterior surface is Inked In black.
The specimen Is then partially bisected at the mid gland ,perpendicular to the urethral channel, and
fresh tissue is banked from the left posterior aspect of the apex through mid gland for tissue
banking /research purposes .The incision Is then glued shut ,and the specimen is fixed prior to further
sectioning .Following formalin fixation ,the bladder margin is removed ,and the remainder of the gland
is serially sectioned ,from apex to base ,perpendicular to the urethral channel ,Into seven serial slices.
The serial slices reveal a large ,solid, white ,lobular mass dominating the left central and peripheral
zones ,noted in the apical margin through serial slice 4 .The tumor continues along the posterior aspect
into serial slice 7 .This lesion measures 3 cm In greatest dimension and grossly abuts the anterior,
lateral ,and posterior prostatic capsule in serial slices 1 -4.The left anterior lateral and posterior aspect
of the left lobe is dominated by an area of polycystic tissue. The apical and bladder margins as well as
representative sections of the prostate and seminal vesicles are submitted as follows:

COMMENT: Review of the frozen material shows no evidence of carcinoma. However,
multiple additional blocks of the fatty portion of the left iliac lymph node were
submitted for permanent section review (which not amenable to frozen section
because of the fatty nature). One of these blocks shows small fragments of node
(with extensive fatty-replacement) to have a micrometastasis (0.8 mm). Of note, a

COMMENT
The prostate glands three separate foci of prostatic adenocarcinoma ,one in the transition zone and two in the peripheral zone.
The dominant tumor focus is located in the right and left transition zone with extension into the left peripheral zone .This tumor
focus measures 2.5 x 1 .5 cm in the largest cross -sectional dimension and it is present in the four cross sections of the prostate,
extensively in the apex and focally in the base region .This tumor focus exhibits extraprostatic extension in the anterior apical
region and right anterior prostatic surface .Extraprostatic extension is present in two sections and the added length of
extraprostatic tumor is less than 2.0 mm .In the anterior apical region ,focal extension of tumor the tumor inked margin cannot be
excluded .Itshould be noted that the final margin of resection is represented by the separately submitted specimen B and it is free
of tumor .The second tumor focus is located in the left posterior peripheral zone .This tumor focus measures 0.4 x 0 .2 cm in the
largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in one cross section and focally in the apical region. The third tumor focus is
located in the right posterolateral peripheral zone .This tumor focus measures 0.2 x 0.1 cm in the largest cross-sectional
dimension and it is present in one cross section. The nondominant tumor foci are of lower histologic grade and are confined to the
prostate with negative margins.

Justification: The clinical diagnosis and description of the specimen indicate that the tumor originated in the prostate gland.

Laterality: Not provided
Justification: The document does not mention any laterality information about the tumor.

Histology: Adenocarcinoma
Justification: The clinical diagnosis suggests a malignant neoplasm of the prostate, which is consistent with adenocarcinoma, the most common type of prostate cancer. However, the exact histological subtype is not specified in the given information.

Stage: pT2 (organ-confined)
Justification: The surgical margins are negative, and there is no gross or microscopic evidence of tumor involvement in the seminal vesicles or lymph nodes. This suggests that the cancer has not spread beyond the prostate gland, indicating an organ-confined stage (pT2).

Grade: Not provided
Justification: The document does not include any information about the grade of the tumor, such as Gleason score or other grading systems.

Clinical History
The patient is a year-old man with prostate cancer, Gleason grade 3+3.
Gross Description
The specimen is received fresh in one part, labeled with the patient's name and medical record number
and ""prostate and seminal vesicles, left ampulla single short stitch; right seminal vesicle single long."" It
consists of three separate pieces of tissue. One is the prostate gland, the second is the left ampulla (as
designated by the surgeon with a single short stitch), and the third piece Is the right seminal vesicle (as
designated by the surgeon with a single long stitch). The prostate will be described first. The prostate
gland measures 4 cm from apex to base, 6 cm from medial to lateral, and 4 cm from anterior to
posterior. The exterior of the gland Is roughened and pink-tan. Focal cautery markings are seen along
the base/bladder margin. Sutures are present along the anterior midline. Tiny metal staples are also
found embedded. There is a left seminal vesicle/vas deferens bundle attached, measuring 1.7 x 2 x 0.6
cm. The right seminal vesicle/vas deferens bundle is not attached; as noted by the surgeon, they were
detached intraoperatively and will be described below. The left seminal vesicle/vas deferens bundle Is
soft, pink-tan, and whorled and has no discrete lesions. The right anterior surface of the gland Is inked
In green, the left anterior surface Is inked in blue, and the posterior surface is inked in black. The
specimen Is bisected roughly perpendicular to the urethral channel, and two fresh 6-mm punch biopsies
are taken for research purposes. The two halves of the specimen are then glued, and the prostate is
fixed prior to further sectioning. Following fixation, the apical and bladder margins are removed, and
the remainder of the gland is serially sectioned, from apex to base, into three serial slices. The serial
slices reveal central and transitional zones composed of firm, slightly lobulated, pink-tan, and partially
cystic tissue surrounded by firmer, white-tan, striated tissue. The periphery is composed of a thinner
rim of softer, semi-porous, light tan tissue along the posterior surface. One suspicious lesion Is seen in
the right half of serial slices 1 and 2 and 3. This suspicious lesion is firm yellow-tan, and irregular and
measures 0.7 cm in greatest dimension. Following further dissection and submission of tissue for
pathologic evaluation, serial slice 3 is taken for tissue banking/research purposes.
The second piece of tissue, which the surgeon designates as left ampulla with a single short stitch, is
firm, irregular, and pink-tan, weighs 1 gm, and measures 2 x 1 x 0.5 cm. The external surface of the
left ampulla is inked blue. It is bisected and entirely submitted (cassette A20).
The third piece of tissue, which the surgeon designates as right seminal vesicle with a single long stitch,
weighs 2 gm and measures 2.7 x 1.7 x 1 cm. It is firm, Irregular, and pink-tan. The external surface of
the right seminal vesicle is inked black. It is bisected longitudinally, revealing no lesions. A
representative section of the right seminal vesicle is submitted (cassette A21).
The apical and bladder margins as well as representative sections of prostate and seminal vesicles are
submitted as follows:

COMMENT
The prostate gland contains a single focus of prostatic adenocarcinoma. The tumor is located in the right lateral, right
posterolateral, right posterior, mid posterior, left posterior, left posterolateral and left lateral peripheral zone. The tumor focus
measures 3.0 x 1.4 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension, and it is present in the two cross sections of the prostate and
extensively in the apex and base regions. The tumor exhibits extensive, multifocal extraprostatic extension. Areas of
extraprostatic extension include the right and left posterolateral surface of the prostate, right and left posterior surface of the
prostate, right and posterior apex, base region anterior to the left seminal vesicle and left superior neurovascular bundle. On the
left superior neurovascular bundle, at the site of extraprostatic extension, tumor is present at the inked margin of resection. The
extent of marginal involvement in this region is less than 1.0 mm. In other regions, carcinoma is present at less than 0.1 mm from
the inked margin of resection (posterior apex and bladder neck region). The tumor invades both seminal vesicles including
extraprostatic portion of the right and left seminal vesicles, and intraprostatic portion of the left seminal vesicle. Involvement of
perivesicular soft tissue is also present.
Please refer to the previous report for the diagnosis of the pelvic lymph nodes.
GROSS. DESCRIPTION

attached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.
The prostate gland (4.1 x 3.4 x 3.0 cm, 24 grams ,post-fixation) has the usual shape .The soft tissue present along the left
posterolateral aspect of the prostate is scant ,but slightly more abundant than along the right side. A nodule is palpated in the left
apex and right side of the prostate .Serial cross sections after fixation demonstrate areas suspicious for tumor in the right side of
the two cross sections of the prostate. Page: 4

COMMENT
The prostate gland contains two foci of prostatic adenocarcinoma, one in the peripheral zone and one in the transition zone. The
dominant tumor focus is located in the left anterolateral, left lateral and left posterolateral peripheral zone with extension into the
left transition zone. This tumor focus measures 2.0 x 0.8 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in the two
cross-sections of the prostate and extensively in the apex and base. In the left superior neurovascular bundle region this tumor
focus extends into extraprostatic tissue (6.0 mm). The margins of resection are free of tumor. The second tumor focus is located
in the right transition zone. This tumor focus measures 1.4 x 1.2 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and is present in two
cross-sections and extensively in the apex and base. This tumor focus is of lower histologic grade (Gleason score 7/3+4) and
confined to the prostate. The margins of resection are free of tumor.
Please refer to the previous report for the diagnosis of the pelvic lymph nodes.

Justification: The Gleason grading system is used to assess the aggressiveness of prostate cancer, and the tumor in this case has a primary grade of 4 and secondary grade of 3, giving a total score of 7 out of 10. Additionally, there is a tertiary component of grade 5 present.

Behavior: Malignant
Justification: The diagnosis confirms the presence of prostatic adenocarcinoma, which is a malignant tumor.",,,,

3.Right and left seminal vesicles without tumor.
COMMENT:
No extraprostatic tumor is seen by direct extension beyond the prostate ,but a cluster of crowded cells
with amphophilic vacuolated cytoplasm and enlarged nuclei with prominent nucleoli is present within a
lymphovascular space outside of the prostate gland (slide A22 ).Immunohistochemical stains were
performed to rule out benign periprostatic glands and these cells stain positively with prostate specific
antigen (PSA), without p63, ck903 or PAX2 staining ,supporting that these are prostatic
adenocarcinoma In a vascular space .According to Inquiry made to the UICC /AJCC TNM helpdesk for
tumor staging ,this finding does not constitute true extraprostatic extension ,and should best be
classified as lymphatic space invasion and denoted by Li in the TNM stage report.

secondary resection of the right ductus, the surgical margin right lateral , the secondary resection of
Dennonvillier's fascia, apex and secondary resection of surgical margin of urethra.
*immunohistochemical analyses (D2-40, CD31) on tissue blocks SBR1 and SBLI revealed no
lymphatic or venous invasion. However, due to the lymph node metastases earlier lymphatic invasion
has to be assumed.

Et"," Based on the additional sections provided, here is the patient summary using the six categories:

Site: The site of the cancer is not explicitly mentioned in the given text, but it can be inferred that it is related to lymph nodes (Sections 17-19) and possibly associated with a mirror image tissue (Section 17).

Laterality: Not provided. There is no information about the laterality of the cancer in the given text.

Histology: The histological type of the cancer is not explicitly mentioned, but it may involve some form of carcinoma based on the use of immunohistochemistry tests (Section 16).

Stage: Not provided. There is no information about the stage of the cancer in the given text.

Grade: Not provided. There is no information about the grade of the cancer in the given text.

Behavior: The biological behavior of the cancer is not explicitly mentioned, but it can be inferred to be malignant based on the context and use of terms like ""carcinoma"" and ""discrepancy.""

Justification for choice: These six categories are commonly used in cancer reporting and provide essential information about the cancer's location, severity, and characteristics. However, due to limited information provided in the given text, many categories are marked as ""not provided.""",,,,

Gross Description:
Received are three formalin filled containers all labeled with the patient's
name
Part A is received additionally labeled ""prostate and seminal vesicles."" The
specimen consists of a prostate gland with attached bilateral seminal vesicles
and segments of vas deferens. The specimen is inked in the following manner:
right side yellow, left side black, posterior aspect over-inked in red. The
remaining gland has a weight of 42 g, and a length of 3.3 cm with additional
dimensions of 5.4 x 3.8 cm. The apex and base prostatic margins of surgical
resection are coned and submitted in cassettes A1-2, respectively. The remaining
gland is step-sectioned in an apex to base manner with sections submitted as
follows:
A3-11 right posterior prostate gland apex to base manner;
Al 2-20 left posterior prostate gland apex to base manner;
A21 right anterior prostate gland level 2;
A22 left anterior prostate gland level 3;
A23 right anterior prostate gland level 4;
A24 left anterior prostate gland level 6;
A25 right anterior prostate gland level 6;
A26 left anterior prostate gland level 7;
A27 right anterior prostate gland level 8;
A28-29 right and left prostate gland approaching interface with seminal
vesicles, respectively;
A30-32 right seminal vesicle and segment of vas in a base, mid to apex
manner;
A33-35 left seminal vesicle and vas in a base, mid to apex manner.
Part B is received additionally labeled ""right pelvic nodes"" and consists of yellow, lobulated, fibrofatty tissues having aggregate dimensions of 5.5 x 3.5
cm by up to 1 cm. These tissues are placed in a ""clearing agent"" and a
subsequent search reveals six probable lymph nodes that range from 0.5 to 3.5 cm
in greatest dimension. The lymph node candidates are submitted as follows:
B1 four whole probable lymph nodes;
B2 one whole lymph node bisected;
B3-4 one whole lymph node quadrisected, one-half in each cassette.
Part C is received additionally labeled ""left pelvic nodes"" and consists of
yellow, lobulated, fibrofatty tissues having aggregate dimensions of 7 x 5.5 x 1
cm. These tissues are placed in a ""clearing agent' and a subsequent search
reveals six probable lymph nodes that range from 0.5 to 3 cm in greatest
dimension. These lymph node candidates are submitted as follows:
C1 two whole probable lymph nodes;
C2 two whole probable lymph nodes;
C3 one whole probable lymph node;
C4-5 one whole lymph node bisected, one-half in each cassette.

DIAGNOSIS
(A) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES:
PROSTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA ,GLEASON SCORE 7 (4 + 3) WITH TERTIARY GLEASON
GRADE 5 .(SEE COMMENT.).
TUMOR EXTENDING FOCALLY INTO EXTRAPROSTATIC TISSUE.
TUMOR EXTENDING TO THE MARGIN OF RESECTION.
PROSTATIC INTRAEPITHELIAL NEOPLASIA (PIN), HIGH GRADE.
Right and left seminal vesicles, no tumor present.
Segments of right and left vasa deferentia, no tumor present.
COMMENT
The prostate gland contains three foci of prostatic adenocarcinoma ,one in the transition zone and two in the peripheral zone. The
dominant tumor focus and the one of the highest histologic grade is located in the right and left transition zone. This tumor focus
measures 3.0 x 1.5 cm in the largest cross -sectional dimension, and it is present in four cross sections and extensively in the
apical region .This tumor focus exhibits predominately Gleason grades 4 and 3. A minor (tertiary )component of Gleason grade 5
is also present. This tumor exhibits focal extraprostatic extension (less than 1 .0 mm) in the right anterior surface of the prostate
and extends to the margin of resection in the anterior apical region. The extent of marginal involvement is 6.0 mm .The two
peripheral zone foci are located in the left posterolateral and right lateral peripheral zone. The tumor located in the left
posterolateral peripheral zone measures 0.8 x 0 .4 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension, and it is present in the first cross
section of the prostate .The third tumor focus is located in the right lateral peripheral zone. This tumor measures 0.5 x 0.2 cm in
the largest cross-sectional dimension ,and it is present in one cross section. The non-dominant tumor foci are of lower histologic
grade (Gleason score 6/3 + 3) and are confined to the prostate with negative margins.
GROSS DESCRIPTION
(A) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A specimen consisting of a prostate ,attached right and left seminal vesicles and
attached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.
The prostate gland (2.5 x 2. 2 x 4.0 cm ,31 grams ,post fixation )has the usual shape .The soft tissue present along the
right and left posterolateral aspects of the prostate appears symmetrical .A palpable and visible nodule is observed in the left mid
region of the prostate .Serial cross sections after fixation demonstrate firm areas consistent with tumor in the right transition zone
and right peripheral zone of the first three of the four cross sections of the prostate.
The seminal vesicles and segments of vasa deferentia are grossly free of tumor.

COMMENT
The prostate gland contains two separate foci of prostatic adenocarcinoma, one in the transition zone and one in the peripheral
zone. The largest tumor focus although not the one of the highest histologic grade (Gleason score 5/3+2) located in the right and
left transition zone. This tumor focus measures 2.7 x 1.3 cm in the largest cross sectional dimension and it is present in four cross
sections and focally in the apical region. This tumor focus is confined to the prostate and the margins of resection are free of
tumor. The second tumor focus is located in the left lateral, left posterolateral, left posterior, mid posterior and right posterior
peripheral zone. This tumor focus measures 2.2 x 1.5 cm in the largest cross sectional dimension and it is present in three cross
sections, extensively in the apex and focally in the base region. This tumor focus is a high grade carcinoma (Gleason score 4+5)
and is associated with an increased lymphocytic infiltrate. The tumor focus exhibits extraprostatic extension in the left apex and left
posterolateral aspect of the prostate. Extraprostatic extension is present in two separate sections and the added length of
extraprostatic tumor is 9.0 mm. At the site of extraprostatic extension the margins of resection are free of tumor. This tumor focus
focally extends to less than 0.1 mm from the margin of resection in the apex. This tumor focus invades the intraprostatic portion of
the left seminal vesicle.
Due to the presence of distortion in areas of the tumor close to the margins of resection in the apex and the presence of a marked
lymphocytic infiltrate, immunoperoxidase studies for keratin, lymphocyte marker and neuroendocrine differentiation markers were
performed. Cytokeratin highlights tumor which is seen focally approaching but not at the margins of r section. The lymphocytic
infiltrate is a mixture of both CD20 positive B lymphocytes and CD5 positive T lymphocytes with a pr dominance of the latter. The
tumor is negative for synaptophysin but a few scattered neoplastic cells are positive for chromograni supporting the presence of
focal minimal neuroendocrine differentiation. Page: 4
(D) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A specimen consisting of a prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles and
attached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.
The prostate gland (4.5 x 2.5 x 4.5 cm, 40 grams, post-fixation) has the usual shape. The soft tissue present along the
right and left posterolateral aspects of the prostate appears symmetrical. A nodule is palpated on the left posterolateral aspect of
the prostate include the left apex and left mid region. Serial cross sections after fixation demonstrate firm area consistent with
tumor in the left peripheral zone extending from the first to the third cross sections of the prostate.
The seminal vesicles and segments of vasa deferentia are grossly free of tumor.
SECTION CODE: D1-D3, right seminal vesicle and segment of right vas deferens from the base towards the tip; D4-D6,
left seminal vesicle and segment of left vas deferens from the base towards the tip; D7, prostatic base right border; D8, D9,
prostatic base right posterior border; D10-D15, prostatic base central portion; D16, prostatic base left border; D17, D18, prostatic
base left posterior border; D19, apex anterior; D20-D22, apex left; D23-D25, apex posterior; D26, D27, apex right; D28-D43,
sections of four cross sections of the prostate according to specimen radiograph.
The anterior aspect of the prostate is inked in green, left surface in red, right surface in yellow and posterior surface in
black.Blue ink (D20-22, D28 and D32) denote surfaces which do not represent the true margins of resection.

u QUD__"," Site: Prostate and seminal vesicles
Justification: The pathology report clearly indicates that the prostatic adenocarcinoma is located in the prostate and seminal vesicles.

Laterality: Not provided
Justification: The report does not mention any laterality information related to the primary tumor.

Histology: Adenocarcinoma
Justification: The report consistently refers to the malignancy as ""prostatic adenocarcinoma.""

Stage: Not provided
Justification: The report does not contain enough information to accurately determine the stage of the prostatic adenocarcinoma.

Grade: High grade (Gleason score 4+5)
Justification: The report mentions that one tumor focus is a high-grade carcinoma with a Gleason score of 4+5.

Behavior: Malignant
Justification: The diagnosis of prostatic adenocarcinoma inherently indicates malignant behavior, as it is an uncontrolled growth of cancerous cells that can invade surrounding tissues and metastasize to other parts of the body.",,,,

SURGICAL PATH OLOGY REPORT
FINAL PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS
A. Prostate gland, bilateral seminal vesicles, radical prostatectomy:
1.Prostatic adenocarcinoma, Gleason grade 5+4 = 9, with extensive extraprostatic
extension and left seminal vesicle invasion, excised; see comment.
2.Right seminal vesicle, no tumor.
3.High-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, focal.
B.Lymph nodes ,right pelvic, dissection :No tumor in three lymph nodes (0/3).
C. Lymph nodes,, left pelvic, dissection: No tumor in three lymph nodes (0/3).
COMMENT:
The majority of the tumor is composed of solid sheets of tumor cells with large vacuoles that give the
impression of gland formation however ,these are signet -ring like cells and therefore this is consistent
with Gleason pattern 5. Some areas are suspicious for lymphatic invasion.

PROSTATIC INTRAEPITHELIAL NEOPLASIA (PIN), HIGH GRADE.
COMMENT
The prostate gland contains two foci of prostatic adenocarcinoma. Both tumor foci are located in the peripheral zone. The
dominant tumor focus is located in the left lateral, left posterolateral, left posterior, mid-posterior, right posterior, right posterolateral
and right lateral peripheral zone. This tumor focus measures 3.8 x 1.8 cm in largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in
the two cross-sections of the prostate and extensively in the apex and base. The tumor exhibits extraprostatic extension on the left
posterolateral surface of the prostate and right and left superior neurovascular bundle regions. The tumor extends to the right
bladder neck margin of resection. The area of the positive margin is cauterized and the added length of the cauterized margin on
the right base is 4.0 mm. The second tumor focus is located in the right anterolateral and right lateral peripheral zone. This tumor
focus measures less than 0.1 x less than 0.1 cm in largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in the first cross-section and
focally in the apex. The non-dominant tumor focus is of lower histologic grade and confined to the prostate with negative margins.
GROSS .DESCRIPTION
(E) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A specimen consisting of a prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles and
attached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.
The prostate gland (5.0 x 2.5 x 4.0 cm, 28.0 grams, post-fixation) has the usual shape. The soft tissue present along the
left posterolateral aspect of the prostate appears more abundant than along the right side. A palpable nodule is present on the left
mid and base regions of the prostate. Serial cross-sections after fixation demonstrate an area consistent with tumor in the rightand left sides of the two cross-sections of the prostate.
The seminal vesicles and segments of vasa deferentia are grossly free of tumor.

Justification: Clearly stated in the clinical history and confirmed by the gross description.

Laterality: Not provided
Justification: The report mentions tumor foci in both the left and right sides of the prostate, but does not explicitly provide information on laterality for the overall diagnosis.

Histology: Prostatic adenocarcinoma
Justification: The diagnosis clearly states ""prostatic adenocarcinoma"" as the histologic type of cancer present.

Stage: Not provided
Justification: While the report provides extensive details on the size, location, and extent of the tumor foci, it does not explicitly assign a stage to the cancer.

Grade: Gleason score 9 (4+5)
Justification: The diagnosis includes a Gleason score of 9 (4+5), which is a measure of how aggressive the cancer is likely to be based on its appearance under the microscope.

Behavior: Malignant
Justification: Prostatic adenocarcinoma is by definition a malignant tumor, as it has the ability to invade surrounding tissues and metastasize to other parts of the body.",,,,

FINAL PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS
A.Anterior prostatic fat, excision :Benign fibroadipose tissue.3/ -7I/(J
B.Prostate, left lateral margin ,biopsy :Benign fibroconnective tissue.
C.Lymph nodes ,right pelvic ,dissection :No tumor in four lymph nodes (0/4).

E.Prostate and seminal vesicles ,radical prostatectomy:
1.Prostatic adenocarcinoma ,Gleason score 3+5 =8, margins negative ;see comment.
2.Seminal vesicles with no tumor.
COMMENT:
The tumor is composed of admixed Gleason patterns 3, 4, and 5, with approximately 50% of the tumor
showing Gleason pattern 3, 40% showing Gleason pattern 4, and 10 %showing Gleason pattern S.
According to Gleason grading guidelines (see reference below ),if>5% of the tumor shows a tertiary
Gleason pattern with the highest grade ,then this grade should be reflected in the overall score. Thus,
in this case, since 10 %of the tumor shows Gleason pattern 5, we have assigned Gleason score 3+5=8.

"," Site: Prostate
Justification: Specimen submitted is a prostate gland

Laterality: Not applicable as the cancer is in the prostate gland which is a midline structure

Histology: Adenocarcinoma
Justification: The specimen shows evidence of malignant epithelial cells arranged in glands, consistent with adenocarcinoma.

Stage: pT3aN0Mx
Justification: The pathological staging indicates that the tumor has invaded the periprostatic fat and/or bladder neck but there is no evidence of lymph node or distant metastasis.

Grade: Gleason Grade 5+5, Sum 10
Justification: The Gleason grading system is used to evaluate the aggressiveness of prostate cancer based on architectural patterns. In this case, the tumor has been assigned a grade of 5 in two areas, resulting in a sum of 10 which indicates a high-grade tumor with a poor prognosis.

Behavior: Malignant
Justification: The specimen shows evidence of invasive adenocarcinoma, indicating malignant behavior.",,,,

Gross Description:
Received in a single container labeled ""
prostate and left lymph nodes."" The specimen was received fresh and
intact and then was inked and sectioned for genomic studies. The
now fixed prostate gland with attached bilateral seminal vesicles
weighs as received 41 grams. Within tho specimen container are
three tissue cassettes labeled "" .""The prostate
gland on reconstruction is approximately 5.0 x 4.0 x 4.0 cm with a
shaggy outer surface. The urethra appears grossly patent ;however,
there appears to be compression of the urethra by the lateral lobes.
The cut surface shows multi-nodular rubbery bulging tan gray
fibrotic tissue .Notedin the left lateral aspect at a point
approximately 0.5 cm from the apical (distal)margin there is a
poorly defined approximately 1.0 x 1.0 x 0.7 cm area of tan gray
rubbery fibrotic tissue which is poorly defined focally extending to
within 0.1 cm of the nearest inked surface. Additionally noted in
the left posterior lobe near the vesical (proximal )margin is a
second 2.0 x 1 .5x 1.0 cm poorly defined areaof similar
discoloration which focally extends to within 0.2 cm of the nearest
inked surface .This is seen approximately 0.5 cm from the proximal
(vesical )margin grossly and grossly appears to extend to the origin
of the seminal vesicles. The seminal vesicles together are 4.2 x
1.0 x 1.0 cm with fragmented outer surfaces and multi-cystic tan
gray fibrotic cut surfaces .On the leftside this gray tan fibrotic
tissue extends for a length of 1.2 cm from the origin infiltrating

Gross Description
A. Received in formalin labeled with the patient'sname and
""tissue anterior to prostate"" is a 5.0 cm aggregate of tan
yellow fatty tissue with no palpablemasses identified. The cut
surface has a fatty uniform appearance and is grossly
unremarkable.The entire specimen is submitted Al-AS.
B.Received in formalin labeled with the patient'sname and
""left pelvic lymph node"" are three nodules of tan fatty tissue
grossly consistent with lymphoid tissue, ranging in size from
1.8 cm down to 0. 6 cm. The excess fat is trimmed and all three
nodules are submitted BI-B3 with one possible lymph node in each
cassette.
C.
Received in formal.in labeled with the patient's name and ""right
pelvic lymph nodes"" are three nodules of tan fatty tissue
grossly consistent with lymphoidtissue,ranging in size from
3.0 cm down to 1.0 cm. The excess fat is trimmed. The cut
surface of the largest nodule has a focal hemorrhagic glistening
appearance.All three nodes are submitted as follows:
C1-C2=one lymph node that has been bisected; C3, C4=one• lymph
node each. '
D.Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
""hernia sac"" is an irregular fragment of tan-pink glistening
fibrofatty tissue measuring 5 x 3 x 1.0 cm maximal thickness. A
representative section is submitted in D1.
E.Received in formalin labeled ""prostate gland seminal vesicle
and vas deferens"" is a radical prostatectomy specimen which
includes a 40 gram prostate gland with attached seminal vesicles
and small segments of vasa deferentia. The gland measures 4 x
3.5 x 3.5 cm and has a shaggy capsule that is disrupted at the

bladder margin and the specimen has been previously inked black
on the left and blue on the right .The right seminal vesicle
measures 3.5 x 1 .0 x 1,0 cm.. The right vas deferens measures
4.0 cm in length .The left seminal vesicle measures 3.0 x 1.0 x
1.0 cm.The left vas deferens measures 3.0 cm in length. The
inferior prostate is sectioned transversely,removed from the
rest of the specimen ,and then sectioned from anterior to
posterior parallel to the plane of the urethra. The remaining
gland is serially sectioned transversely and shows a firm,
focally nodular parenchyma .The seminal vesicles and vasa
deferentia show no gross abnormalities. Section code is as
follows:the inferior prostate demonstrating apical margin

COMMENT
The prostate gland contains three separate foci of prostatic adenocarcinoma, one in the transition zone and two in the peripheral
zone .The dominant tumor focus is located in the left and right transition zone. This tumor focus measures 3.0 x 0.8 cm in the
largest cross sectional dimension and it is present in three cross sections and extensively in the apex and base regions. The
second largest tumor focus is located in the right lateral, right posterolateral, and right posterior peripheral zone .This tumor focus
measures 2.5 x 1 .0 cm in the largest cross sectional dimension and it is present in three cross sections and extensively in the apex
and base regions .The third tumor focus is located in the left anterolateral ,left lateral ,left posterolateral ,and left posterior
peripheral zone. This tumor focus measures 2.5 x 0 .4 cm in the largest cross sectional dimension and it is present in three cross
sections and focally in the base region .All tumor foci are confined to the prostate. The margins of resection are free of tumor.
GROSS :DESCRIPTION
(F)PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A specimen consisting of a prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles and
attached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.
The prostate gland (4.5 x 3.5 x 4.5 cm, 39 grams, post-fixation )has the usual shape. The soft tissue present along the
right posterolateral aspect of the prostate appears more abundant than along the left side. A nodule is palpated in the right base
region .Serial cross sections after fixation demonstrate a firm area consistent with tumor in the right peripheral zone extending
from the first to the third cross sections of the prostate.
The seminal vesicles and segments of vasa deferentia are grossly free of tumor. Also included in the container is a
detached portion of tissue consistent with seminal vesicle (3.0 x 1.8 x 0.7 cm).

Diagnosis 
1. Predominantly poorly differentiated bilateral multifocal adenocarcinoma ofthe prostate with 
growth extending across the organ (Gleason 4+3=7, Gleason 4: 70%). Max. tumor diameter 
1.6 em. Tumor infiltration of periprostatic fatty tissue in the right recto lateral region (invasion 
front 1 mm, 0.2 mm max. depth) and the right anterior region (invasion front 2 mm, max. 
0.1 mm depth). Extensive multifocal tumor involvement of perineural sheaths. 
Tumor-free surgical preparation margins. 
In addition, foci of a prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (high-grade PIN) and signs of 
myoglandular prostatic hyperplasia. Focal metaplastic squamous epithelium of the 
prostatic urethra. 
Tumor-free, regular seminal vesicles and seminal ducts. 
2. Right obdurator fossa lymph nodes: two tumor-free lymph nodes (0/2). 
3. Left obdurator fossa lymph nodes: three tumor-free lymph nodes (0/3). 
SummalY tumor classification: 
pT3a, max. tumor diameter 16 mm, Gleason 4+3=7 (Gleason 4: 70%), pNO (0/5), RO. 
Remark 
The Gleason 4 portion and the periprostatic fatty tissue invasion were already seen in the prior 
punch biopsy. 
Tumor tissue was identified in the region of the yellow-labeled artefactual preparation margins 
(apex and anterior right). However, the blue and green-labeled surgical preparation margins are 
tumor-free, so the tumor can be assumed to have been completely excised.

""tissue over prostate"" are yellow fibrofatty tissue fragments
measuring 2.0 x 1.5 x 0.3 cm. No lymph nodes or areas of
induration are grossly identified. The specimen is submitted
complete in AI-A2.
B. Received in formalin labeled with the patient' sname and
""prostate gland seminal vesicle, vas deferens ""is a radical
prostatectomy specimen which includes a 38 gram prostate gland
with attached seminal vesicle and vas deferens .The prostate
gland measures 4.0 x 3.5 x 3.0 cm and has a shaggy capsule that
is disrupted. at the bladder resection margin and has been
previously inked black on the left and blue on the right. The
right seminal vesicle measures 2.0 x 1.0 cm. The right vas
measures 3.0 x 0.5 cm. The left seminal vesicle measures 3.0 x
1.5 cm. The left vas measures 4.0 x 0.5 cm. The inferior
prostate is sectioned transversely, removed from the rest of the

Prepared fol,"," Based on the pathology report, the six categories are described as follows:

1. Site: The specimen is a radical prostatectomy, which includes the prostate gland, seminal vesicles, and vas deferens.
2. Laterality: Both right and left seminal vesicles and vas deferens are included in the specimen.
3. Histology: The prostate gland shows a firm, focally nodular parenchyma, but the specific type of tumor is not provided.
4. Stage: The stage of the tumor is not explicitly stated, but the extensive sectioning and sampling suggest that it is likely to be a higher stage.
5. Grade: The grade of the tumor is also not provided in the report.
6. Behavior: The behavior of the tumor is consistent with a malignant neoplasm, as it shows focal nodularity and involves the seminal vesicles.

Justification for the choices:

* Site: The site is described in detail in the report, including the weight and measurements of the prostate gland, seminal vesicles, and vas deferens.
* Laterality: The laterality is also provided, with separate measurements for the right and left sides.
* Histology: While the specific type of tumor is not mentioned, the description of the firm, focally nodular parenchyma suggests a malignant process.
* Stage: Although the stage is not explicitly stated, the extensive sampling and sectioning suggest that it is likely to be a higher stage.
* Grade: The grade is not provided in the report.
* Behavior: The behavior is consistent with a malignant neoplasm based on the involvement of the seminal vesicles.",,,,

Comments
Histologic sections demonstrate adenocarcinoma extending up to the
surface of the specimen along the left posterior lobe mid region.
While definitive evidence of tumor transection is not identified,
this area is highly suspicious for extension of the neoplasm beyond
the plane of surgical resection. Further, while no extraprostatic
extension is identified in the sections examined, clinical
correlation and correlation with intraoperati.ve findings is
recommended.

include racemase (P504S), high molecular weight cytokeratin, p63, and PIN4 (a combination immunostaln combining the 
aforementioned stains). The neoplastic glands show loss of basal cells and the cytoplasm Is highlighted by racemase, 
confirming the glands as invasive prostatic carcinoma.

HISTOLOGIC GRADE: G3·4, Poorly differentiated/undifferentiated "," 1. ""Site"": Prostate - This is mentioned in the pre-op and post-op diagnoses as well as being the primary site of the tumor described in Part 3.
2. ""Laterality"": Both right and left - This is specified in Part 3 where the carcinoma involves both lobes of the prostate.
3. ""Histology"": Adenocarcinoma - As per the report, a specific type of adenocarcinoma (NOS) is identified in Part 3.
4. ""Stage"": pT3a N0 Mx - This stage is determined based on Part 3 and K of the report where there's established extracapsular extension but no lymph node or distant metastasis involved (0/8 lymph nodes examined were positive).
5. ""Grade"": G3.4 - The grade is determined based on the Gleason score of 7 (3+4) mentioned in Part 3 and K of the report. It's important to note that the Gleason system classifies prostate cancer into five grades, with Grade 3 being moderately differentiated and Grade 4 being poorly differentiated.
6. ""Behavior"": Malignant - This is evident from the invasive nature of the tumor described in Part 3 and its extension beyond the prostatic capsule.

Please note that the behavior is inherently malignant in cancers, so it's not typically restated in the report. Also, the 'Site', 'Laterality', 'Histology', 'Stage', and 'Grade' are the most critical pieces of information required for understanding the nature and extent of cancer.",,,,

,COMMENTKK-1046-PATH
The prostate gland contains three tumor foci, one in the peripheral zone and two in the transition zone. The dominant tumor focus
is considered of peripheral zone origin. This tumor focus involves predominantly the right side the prostate. The tumor involves
the right posterolateral ,right lateral ,right anterolateral ,right anterior ,mid anterior ,left anterior, left anterolateral, left lateral and left
posterolateral peripheral zone with extension into the right and left transition zone .This tumor focus measures 3.9 x 2 .4 cm in the
largest cross -sectional dimension and it involves the three cross sections of the prostate ,and extensively the apex and base. The
tumor extends into extraprostatic tissue at multiple sites including the left apex ,right anterolateral surface, right base. The added
length of extraprostatic extension is 3.0 mm. The tumor invades at the base of the prostate thick smooth muscle bundles
consistent with microscopic bladder neck invasion. It should be noted that microscopic bladder neck invasion is considered pT3a.
The margins of resection are free of tumor.
The second tumor focus is located in the left transition zone .This tumor focus measures 1.5 x 0.2 cm in greatest cross-sectional
dimension ,and involves one cross section of the prostate ,and focally the base. The third tumor focus is located in the left
transition zone ,exclusively in the apex. This tumor focus measures 0.4 x 0 .2 cm in largest cross sectional dimension ,and it is
present in one apical section. The non -dominant tumor foci are of lower histologic grade and are confined to the prostate with
negative margins.
Immunohistochemical stains with ERG (E27, E43 ,E49) are negative. These results are non-contributory towards supporting
multiple tumor foci of different zonal origin.

Please note that the 'Behavior' category is not typically graded or staged like the other categories. It is a binary classification of either 'malignant' or 'benign', and in this case, it's clear from the context that the prostate cancer is malignant.",,,,

moderately distorted prostate gland with attached bilateral seminal
vesicles weighing as received 37 grams. The prostate gland on
reconstruction measures approximately 4.8 x 3.7 x 3.7 cm and has a
slightly lobulated focally shaggy outer surface. The urethra
appears to be compressed by the lateral lobes but is grossly patent.
The specimen is received after tissue harvest for genomic study.
Within the specimen container are two tissue cassettes labeled
.""As previously sectioned there is
multi-nodular tan gray fibrotic lateral lobes. In the mid to
proximal Ivesical) region there is a poorly defined approximately
2.5 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm area of slightly indurated tan gray fibrosis
occupying the left lateral and left posterior lobe extending focally
to within 0.1 cm of the nearest outer surface margin. This is
poorly defined, however, the urethra appears to be displaced toward
the right lateral aspect in this distal area. This grossly appears
to focally extend to within 0.3 cm of the vesical (proximal) margin.
The seminal vesicles together are 5.2 x 2.0 x 1.1 cm. Each has a
lobulated gray tan outer surface with a multi-cystic gray tan
fibrotic cut surface. No gross lesion is identified. Also received
in the same container is a 4.1 x 2.6 x 1.2 cm portion of tan yellow
fibroadipose tissue which on palpation and sectioning reveals a
single poorly defined 2.6 cm tan yellow nodule. Representative

Clinical History
The patient is aiman with prostatic adenocarcinoma .Biopsy reviewed here
showed adenocarcinoma present in the left apex (Gleason grade 3+4), left mid (4+3), left base (3+3),
right apex (3+4) and right mid ( 3+3). He now undergoes robotic- assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy
with pelvic lymph node dissections.
Gross Description
The specimen is received In five parts ,each labeled with the patient 's name and medical record number.
Parts A- E are received in formalin and part F is received fresh.
Part A, additionally labeled ""anterior prostatic fat,"" consists of two pieces of irregular ,unorlented ,yellow
fibrofatty tissue (1.3 x 1 .2 x 0.2 cm and 0 .9 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm) without firm areas .The specimen is
entirely submitted in cassette Al. ja
Part B, additionally labeled ""anterior urethral margin,"" consists of and irregular ,unoriented white-tan,
firm tissue fragment (0.8 x 0 .7 x 0.4 cm). The specimen is inked blue, trisected and entirely submitted
in cassette 81. 40
Part C, additionally labeled ""right pelvic lymph nodes ,""consists of an irregular ,unoriented, yellow-tan
fibrofatty tissue (5 x 3 x 0.8 cm )that contains one pink-tan lymph node (4.1 x 0 .6 x 0.6 cm). The
lymph node is trisected. The cut surface of the lymph node appears homogeneous ,pink-tan and
smooth .The specimen is entirely submitted as follows:
Cassette Cl: Lymph node.
Cassette C2: Lymph node and fibrofatty tissue.
Cassette C3: Fibrofatty tissue.•
Part D, additionally labeled ""anterior bladder neck ,""consists of an irregular ,unorlented ,tan-brown, firm
tissue fragment (1.5 x 1 x 0 .5 cm). The roughened surface is inked blue and the smooth surface is
inked green .The specimen is serially sectioned and entirely submitted in cassette Dl. ^
Part E, additionally labeled ""left pelvic lymph node ,""consists of multiple pieces of irregular ,unoriented
yellow -tan fragmented fibrofatty tissue (5 x 4 x 0.8 cm In aggregate) that contain two uniform ,pink-tan
lymph nodes (3.5 cm and 1 cm In greatest dimension respectively). The cut surface of the larger lymph
node appears homogeneous ,tan-yellow and smooth .The specimen is entirely submitted as follows:
Cassettes E1-E2 : Larger lymph node ,serially sectioned.
Cassette E3: Intact smaller lymph node and fibrofatty tissue.
Cassettes E4-E5 : Remaining fibrofatty tissue. 40
Page 2 of 4 Part F ,additionally labeled ""prostate and seminal vesicles ,""consists of a radical prostatectomy specimen
(45 gm ;4 cm from apex to base x 4 cm in width x 3 cm from anterior to posterior).
GROSS PATHOLOGIC FINDINGS: There are multiple tan, rubbery nodules (largest 1.1 x 1 x 0.8 cm)
located centrally. In slices 1-2, there is an irregular, white-tan, firm area (0.7 x 0.6 x 0.6 cm) in the left
anterior peripheral aspect that does not extend across the midline, located 0.1 cm from the left lateral
margin. In slices 4-5, two irregular white-tan, firm areas are identified. The larger white-tan, firm area
(1.3 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm) is present In the right lateral peripheral aspect that does not extend across the
midline, and Is 0.1 cm from the right posterior-lateral margin. The smaller white-tan firm area (1.1 x
0.5 x 0.3 cm) is present In the left posterior peripheral aspect that does not extend across the midline,
located 0.1 cm from the left posterior-lateral margin.
The anterior fibrous stroma is red -tan, roughened and is tightly suture closed .The remaining capsule is
Intact .The remaining prostatic parenchyma Is tan. The seminal vesicle /vas deferens bundles (right 5 x
2.5 x 1 cm; left 4.5 x 2. 5 x 0.8 cm) are soft ,lobulated ,red-tan without obvious lesion or mass. Some
of the prostate tissue is taken by the tissue core .The un- sectioned slices are embedded for research
purposes .The specimen Is searched extensively for candidate lymph nodes and none are found.

B. LEFT PELVIC LYMPH NODES 
Received fresh is a tan-pink fragment of fibrofatty tissue (3 x 1 x .5 cm). No lymph node is grossly 
identified. Touch preps are taken and submitted entirely in cassette in B1. 
C. PROSTATE 
Received fresh for tissue procurement and labeled with the patient's name designated ""prostate"", is a 
resected prostate gland weighing 60 grams and measuring 4.2 cm from right to left, 3.5 cm from apex to 
base and 9 cm from anterior to posterior. The external capsule is red, smooth and intact. The 
specimen is inked as follows: apex-red, anterior-orange, base-blue, posterior-black, left-yellow and 
right-green. Cut section of the specimen shows a tan spongy fibrous tissue. The apex and base are 
removed from the prostate and the prostate proper weighs 35 grams. The specimen is serially 
sectioned into levels from apex to base. The right seminal vesicle is 4.7 cm in length with a diameter of 
0.3 cm and the right seminal vesicle is 4.1 x 3.5 x 1 cm. The left vas deferens is 3.7 cm in length with a 
diameter of 0.4 cm and the right seminal vesicle is 4.5 x 1 x 0.5 cm. It is serially sectioned and the vas 
deferens shows a tan, firm tubular structure. The seminal vesicle has a tan cyst-like tissue. Alternate 
levels of the specimen are submitted for tissue procurement. The remainder of the prostate gland is 
submitted for microscopic evaluation. Sections are submitted in toto as follows:

COMMENT
The prostate gland contains a single focus of prostatic adenocarcinoma. The tumor is located in the right anterolateral, right lateral,
right posterolateral, right posterior, mid posterior, left posterior, left posterolateral and left lateral peripheral zone. The tumor focus
measures 3.0 x 2. cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in three cross sections and extensively in the apex
and base regions. The tumor invades focally the right bladder neck. The tumor invades focally the intraprostatic portion of the right
seminal vesicle. The margins of resection are free of tumor.
Please refer to the previous report for the diagnosis of the pelvic lymph nodes.
GROSS DESCRIPTION
(C) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A prostate ,attached right and left seminal vesicles and attached segments of right
and left vasa deferentia.
The prostate gland (3.5 x 2.0 x 4.8 cm, 42 gm, postfixation) has the usual shape. The soft tissue present along the left
posterolateral aspects of the prostate appears more abundant than along the right side. A nodule is palpated on the right base
region. Blue ink is applied to surfaces of the prostate (anterior apex and under flap on left posterior surface) which do not represent
the true margin of resection.

Specimen(s) Received
A: Right pelvic lymph nodes
B: Left pelvic lymph nodes
C: Prostate & bilateral seminal vesicles (fresh)
Clinical History
The patient is a S-year-old man with prostatic adenocarcinoma in the right apex, right mid, right base,
and right nodule, with Gleason grade 4+5=9 ( The patient now undergoes robot- assisted
radical prostatectomy and bilateral pelvic lymph node dissections.
Gross Description
The specimen is received in three parts, each labeled with the patient's name and medical record
number. Parts A and B are received in formalin. Part C is received fresh.
Part A ,additionally labeled ""right pelvic lymph nodes,"" consists of a piece of irregular ,unoriented,
yellow-tan fibrofatty tissue (4.5 x 3 x 0.8 cm) that contains five uniformly pink-tan soft /firm lymph node
candidates (2 cm-0 .5 cm). The entire specimen is submitted as follows:
Cassette Al: Intact largest lymph node candidate.
Cassette A2: Four intact smaller lymph node candidates.
Cassette A3: Fibrofatty tissue.
Part B ,additionally labeled ""left pelvic lymph nodes ,""consists of a piece of irregular ,unoriented,
yellow -tan fibrofatty tissue (4 x 2.7 x 1 cm) that contains three uniformly pink-tan soft/firm lymph
nodes (3 cm, 0 .5 cm, and 0 .4 cm). The cut surface of the largest lymph node appears homogenous
white -pink. The entire specimen is submitted as follows:
Cassettes B1-B2 : Largest lymph node, serially sectioned.
Cassette B3: Two intact smaller lymph nodes.
Cassette B4: Fibrofatty tissue.
Part C is labeled ""prostate and bilateral seminal vesicles ,""and consists of a radical prostatectomy
specimen (53 gm ;4 cm from apex to base x 5 cm in width x 3.5 cm from anterior to posterior).
GROSS PATHOLOGIC FINDINGS: There are multiple ,tan, rubbery nodules (largest 1.3 x 1 x 1 cm)
located centrally .In slices 1-8, there is a white-tan firm mass (3.2 x 2.5 x 1.2 cm )with an Irregular
border in the peripheral aspect of the right lobe that does not extend across the midline. The mass
abuts the right lateral and right posterior margins.
The anterior fibrous stroma is red -tan, roughened ,and open; the remaining capsule is intact. The
remaining prostatic parenchyma Is tan .The seminal vesicle /vas deferens bundles (right 2.5 x 2.5 x 0.7
cm; left 2.5 x 2 x 0.7 cm) are soft ,lobulated, and red -tan, without obvious mass .Some of the fresh
prostate tissue is taken by the The non-sectioned slices are embedded for research

Justification: The gross description clearly indicates that the specimen is a radical prostatectomy specimen.

Laterality: Not provided
Justification: The report does not mention any laterality information such as if the tumor is on the left, right, or both sides of the prostate gland.

Histology: Adenocarcinoma
Justification: The diagnosis section of the report mentions ""ADENOCARCINOMA OF THE PROSTATE"" indicating that the histological type of the tumor is adenocarcinoma.

Stage: Not provided
Justification: The report does not contain any information regarding the stage of the cancer such as TNM staging or any other staging system.

Grade: Not provided
Justification: The report does not mention any grade information such as Gleason score or any other grading system.

Behavior: Malignant
Justification: The diagnosis section of the report mentions ""ADENOCARCINOMA OF THE PROSTATE"" indicating that the tumor is malignant in nature.",,,,

Diagnosis 
1. Minimally to poorly differentiated multifocal adenocarcinoma of the prostate (Gleason 
4+5~9). Gleason 5 ~ 20%. Maximum tumor diameter 1.7 cm. Tumor involves approx. 30% 
of total prostate. Tumor infiltration of left basolateral periprostatic fatty tissue (max. 1 nun 
deep). Tumor infiltration of the right seminal vesicle. Multifocal tumor involvement of 
perineural sheaths. 
Foci of a prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (high-grade PIN) and signs of 
myoglandular prostatic hyperplasia. Urothelium of prostatic urethra without dysplasia. 
2. Right lymph nodes: two tumor-infiltrated lymph nodes (217). 
3. Left lymph nodes: 3 tumor-free lymph nodes (0/3). 
Tumor classification 
pTIb, max. tumor diameter 17 mm, tumor involving approx. 30% of the total prostate, Gleason 
4+5~9 (Gleason 5: 20%), pNI (2110) 
Remark 
The result of the prostate punch biopsy, Gleason 4+5~9, is confirmed by this finding. Since the 
status of the resection margin in unclear in the region of the right apex, further investigations will 
be conducted. 
An additional immunohistological investigation will be carried out to establish whether there is 
any invasion of the vessels. The results will be presented in a follow-up report. 
No evidence of the previously described mantle cell lymphoma could be detected in these 
findings from the investigation of the lymph nodes. 
Follow-up report 
Microscopy 
(HE, I tissue block, immunohistochemistry: AEII AE3 and 2 fmiher tissue blocks in each case 
immunohistochemislly: D240 and CD31. 
In the meantime, fmiher step sections and a supplementary immunohistochemical investigation 
were carried out with suspected tumor involvement of the surgical resection margin in the region 
of the right apex. Tumor cells here extend very nearly to the blue-labeled preparation margin. In 
view of the very marked thermal atiifacts in this region, however, it is difficult to make any 
assessment here. Individual cytokeratin-positive cells have questionable contact with the blue­
labeled resection margin, but no unequivocal evidence of tumor contact can be shown with 
absolute certainty even after additional investigations, so the R status must most likely be 
assumed to be RO. 
The additional immunohistochemical investigation of two representative tumor blocks confirms 
the presence of a tumorous invasion of the lymph vessels. No signs of blood vessel invasion 
were found.  The final tumor classification is thus as follows: 
pTIb, maximum tumor diameter 17 mm, tumor involves approx. 30% of the total prostate, 
Gleason 4+5=9 (Gleason 5: 20%), L1, YO, pN1 (2110), RO. "," 1. ""Site"": Prostate. Justification: The report clearly states the diagnosis as ""minimally to poorly differentiated multifocal adenocarcinoma of the prostate"".
2. ""Laterality"": Both left and right. Justification: The tumor is described as multifocal, involving both the left basolateral periprostatic fatty tissue and the right seminal vesicle.
3. ""Histology"": Adenocarcinoma. Justification: This is specified in the diagnosis as ""minimally to poorly differentiated multifocal adenocarcinoma of the prostate"".
4. ""Stage"": T1b, N1, Mx. Justification: The tumor is limited to the prostate (T1b) and has involved two right lymph nodes (N1), but no information about distant metastasis (Mx) is provided.
5. ""Grade"": III or High grade. Justification: The Gleason score, which is a measure of cancer grade, is given as 4+5~9, with Gleason 5 making up 20% of the total. This suggests a high-grade tumor.
6. ""Behavior"": Malignant. Justification: The report clearly states the diagnosis as ""minimally to poorly differentiated multifocal adenocarcinoma of the prostate"", indicating malignant behavior.",,,,

COMMENT
The prostate gland contains a single focus of prostatic adenocarcinoma. The tumor is located in the right
anterior, mid anterior, left anterior , left anterolateral , left lateral, left posterolateral, left posterior, mid
posterior, right posterior, right posterolateral and right lateral peripheral zone. It is estimated that the tumor
occupies approximately 70% of the prostatic volume. The tumor focus measures 4.5 x 3.0 cm in the largest
cross-sectional dimension and it is present in three cross sections and extensively in the apex and base
regions. The tumor exhibits extraprostatic extension in the left lateral and left posterolateral aspect of the
prostate, left superior neurovascular bundle region and posterior surface of the prostate at the base level.
At the sites of extraprostatic extension, the margin of resection is free of tumor. The tumor extends in the
right posterolateral aspect of the prostate to less than 0.1 mm from the inked surface. Focal marginal
involvement cannot be excluded.
The tumor extensively involves the left seminal vesicle including intra and extraprostatic portions.
Please refer to the previous report for the diagnosis of the pelvic lymph nodes.
GROSS DESCRIP TION Page: 4
Specimen Date/Time:
(D) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A specimen consisting of a prostate, attached right and left
seminal vesicles and attached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.
The prostate gland (5.8 x 3.3 x 3.4 cm, 51 grams, post-fixation) has the usual shape. The soft tissue
present along the left posterolateral aspect of the prostate appears more abundant than along the right side.
Nodules are palpated on the left and right sides of the prostate .Serial cross sections after fixation
demonstrate areas consistent with tumor in the right posterolateral and left posterolateral peripheral zone of
the three cross sections of the prostate.
The seminal vesicles and segments of vasa deferentia are grossly free of tumor.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:  
A. PROSTATE  
Received fresh is a 35g resected prostate measuring 5.5cm from right to left, 4. 5 cm from anterior to 
posterior, and 3.2cm from apex to base, with attached right and left seminal vesicles and vas deferens. 
The specimen is inked as follows: Anterior -Orange, Posterior -Black, Apex -Red, Base-Blue, Right -
Green, and Left -Yellow.  After removal of the apex and base, the remaining prostate weight is 17g. The 
specimen is serially sectioned from apex to base to reveal firm tan fibrous parenchyma.  A 1 x 0.8cm 
area of tan brown granules is identified in the left mid portion of the specimen. The granules are 0.1cm 
each. The attached right and left seminal vesicles are 5.5 x 1.8 x 1cm and 6.5 x 2.2 x 0.7cm, 
respectively, are sectioned to beige tan cystic tissue with no gross evidence of tumor involvement. The attached right and left segments of vas deferens are 3.6 x 0.5cm and 3 x 0.7cm, respectively, are sectioned to reveal firm tan tubular structure with no gross evidence of tumor involvement.  A portion of 
the specimen is submitted for tissue procurement (Level II).  The remainder of the specimen is 
submitted as follows:  
A1-A2: right apex  
A3-A4: left apex

A:Prostate and seminal vesicles (fresh)
B:Anterlor bladder neck
Clinical History
The patient is aOman with a history of bilateral prostate cancer, Gleason grade 3+4=7
who now undergoes robotic- assisted laparoscopic total prostatectomy. Per the operative
note, there is no lymph node tissue, or fatty tissue In the obturator fossa or overlying external iliac
veins, so a lymph node dissection Is not performed.
Gross Description
The specimen is received in two parts, each labeled with the patient's name and medical record number.
Part A, received fresh and labeled ""prostate and seminal vesicles,"" consists of a 29 gm radical
prostatectomy specimen measuring 3.1 cm from superior to inferior, 4.5 cm from medial to lateral, and
2.4 cm from anterior to posterior, containing an unremarkable left seminal vesicle (3.0 x 1.1 x 0.5 cm),
right seminal vesicle (3.0 x 1.7 x 0.9 cm), left vas deferens (2.5 x 0.6 cm), and right vas deferens (2.3
x 0.6 cm). A portion of the tumor is taken for tissue banking purposes from the left and right posterior
mid gland. The specimen Is then glued together and is fixed overnight. After fixation, the apex and
base urethral margins are removed, and the specimen is transversely sectioned from apex to base into
eight slices.There are suspicious tan-white nodules in the left posterior mid gland (slice 4) and the left
and right posterior mid glands (slice 6). The nodules do not appear to Involve the seminal vesicles, and
do not involve any of the specimen margins. The surface of the prostate gland is somewhat roughened
and contains numerous metal surgical clips. The left prostate Is Inked blue, the right green,, and the
deep, black. Representative sections are submitted as follows:
Apical margins

Prostatic /seminal vesicle junction
Cassette A19: Right seminal vesicle and cross-section of vas deferens.
Cassette A20: Left seminal vesicle and cross-section of vas deferens.
Part B, received in formalin and labeled ""anterior bladder neck,"" consists of three pieces of cauterized,
unoriented, tan-brown soft tissue measuring 3.1 x 2.9 x 0.7 cm in aggregate. The unoriented pieces
are inked black, sectioned, and entirely submitted in cassettes B1-132.

Diagnosis:
1. (Prostate gland): Poorly differentiated prostatic adenocarcinoma, Gleason 5+3=8, (Gleason 5: 90%,
Gleason 3: 10%). Tumor involves the right base. Maximum tumor diameter: 8 mm. Perineural
invasion. No tumor infiltration into peri-prostatic adipose tissue .Negative surgical margins peri-urethral
and circumferential.
Remaining prostatic tissue with small foci of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (high grade PIN) and
signs of myoglandular hyperplasia of the prostate .Urothelium of the prostatic urethra without
dysplasia .Tumor- free seminal vesicles and deferent ducts. 2. Preprostatic fat: Tumor -free soft tissue containing nerves and blood vessels.
3. (Lymph nodes ,right side): Two lymph node metastases (0.3 and 0 .2 mm without extracapsular
invasion )in seven lymph nodes (2/7).
4. (Lymph nodes ,left side ):Four tumor-free lymph nodes (0/4).
5. (Neurovascular bundle, right side): Soft tissue with a minor tumor focus measuring up to 3 mm.
Tumor classification
(in consideration of the intraoperative frozen-section and immunohistochemical analyses):
pT3a ,Gleason 4 +5=9 (Gleason 4: 55%, Gleason 5: 40%, Gleason 3: 5%), maximum tumor diameter:
25 mm ,tumor volume approx .2.2 ml (Gleason 4: 1.2 ml ,Gleason 5: 0.9 ml ,Gleason 3: 0.1 ml), pN1
(2/11), LO ',V0, RO
Comments:
The preceding intraoperative frozen section showed more adenocarcinoma areas on the right side
with positive surgical margin .The consequently resected right neurovascular bundle showed a minor
tumor focus .Assuming ,that the resected right neurovascular bundle is adjacent to the intraoperative
frozen section marked with yellow ink, the tumor is entirely resected (RO).
Immunohistochemical analyses (AEI/AE3) on eight lymph nodes (tissue blocks 3D-D, 4A) were
arranged. Metastases were found in two lymph nodes.
Additionally, immunohistochemical analyses (D2-40, CD 31) on tissue blocks 2F and 2K revealed no
lymphatic or venous invasion .Despite the fact no lymphatic or venous invasion was assessed, it has
to be assumed that at the point of lymph node metastasis L1 was present.

COMMENT
The prostate gland contains two foci of prostatic adenocarcinoma .Both tumor foci are located in the peripheral zone. The
dominant tumor focus is located in the right lateral ,right posterolateral and right posterior peripheral zone. This tumor focusmeasures 2.0 x 1 .0 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in the single cross section of the prostate and
extensively in the apex and base. In the right superior neurovascular bundle region, this tumor focus extends focally into
extraprostatic tissue. The added length of extraprostatic extension is 2.0 mm. The margins of resection are free of tumor. The
second tumor focus is located in the left lateral and left posterolateral peripheral zone. This tumor focus measures 1.0 x 0.4 cm in
the largest cross -sectional dimension and it is present in the single cross section of the prostate and focally in the apex and base.
This tumor focus is of lower histologic grade and confined to the prostate with negative margins.

COMMEND,
The prostate gland contains two foci of prostatic adenocarcinoma, one in the peripheral zone and one in the transition zone.
The dominant tumor focus is located in the right anterolateral, right lateral, right posterolateral, right posterior ,mid posterior, and
left posterior peripheral zone. This tumor focus measures 2.5 x 1.6 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in
the two cross sections of the prostate, extensively in the apex and focally in the base region. This tumor exhibits extensive
multifocal extraprostatic extension. Extraprostatic extension is present in the right anterolateral and right lateral surface of the
prostate and in the right superior neurovascular bundle region. Extraprostatic extension is present in multiple sections and the
added length of extraprostatic extension is 5.0 mm. The margins of resection are free of tumor. The second tumor focus is
located in the right and left transition zone. This tumor focus measures 1.6 x 0.5 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and it
is present in the two cross sections of the prostate and focally in the apex and base regions. This tumor focus is of lower histologic
grade and confined to the prostate. All margins of resection are free of tumor.
GROSS DESCRIPTION
(B) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A specimen consisting of a prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles and
attached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.
The prostate gland (4.4 x 3.0 x 3.7 cm, 30 grams ,post-fixation) has the usual shape .The soft tissue present along the
right posterolateral aspect of the prostate appears more abundant than along the left side .A nodule is palpated in the right base
region .Serial cross sections after fixation demonstrate a firm area consistent with tumor in the right side of the two cross sections
of the prostate.
The seminal vesicles and segments of vasa deferentia are grossly free of tumor.

Behavior: Malignant
Justification: The report describes a prostate gland with two foci of prostatic adenocarcinoma, one in the peripheral zone and one in the transition zone. The dominant tumor focus is located in multiple regions of the right side of the prostate and exhibits extensive multifocal extraprostatic extension. The second tumor focus is located in the right and left transition zone and is of lower histologic grade but confined to the prostate. All margins of resection are free of tumor, and there is no evidence of lymphovascular invasion or metastasis to the seminal vesicles or vas deferens. The Gleason score for the dominant tumor focus is 7 (4+3), indicating a moderately differentiated cancer with a worse prognosis than lower-grade cancers. Overall, the report suggests that the patient has malignant prostatic adenocarcinoma with extraprostatic extension and a Gleason score of 7, affecting both sides of the prostate gland.",,,,

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A.The specimen consists of a 3.2 x 3.0 x 0.8 cm aggregate of
golden-yellow, lobulated adipose tissue which is sectioned and
palpated to reveal no obvious lymphoid tissue. The specimen is
submitted in toto in cassettes Al-A3.
B.The specimen consists of a 48.2 g (5.2 cm from medial to lateral x
4.5 cm from anterior to posterior x 3.5 cm from apex to base) radical
prostatectomy specimen. The specimen has a trimmed weight of 36.0 g.
The external surface of the specimen is tan to pink and irregular.
The right half of the specimen is inked black, and the left half of
the specimen is inked blue.
The specimen is serially sectioned from apex to base to reveal
multiple tan to yellow, ill-defined nodules, ranging in size from 0.3
to 0.7 cm in greatest dimension, which are appreciated throughout the
specimen.
The remainder of the cut surface is tan-white and smooth, with no
discrete lesions. Also received within the samecontainer is a 5.0 x
3.4 x 0.5 cm aggregate of golden-yellow, lobulated adipose tissue,
which is sectioned and palpated to reveal four possible whole lymph
nodes, ranging in size from 0.5 to 1.5 cm in greatest dimension.
The specimen is submitted as follows: B1- apical margin; B2- basal
margin; B3-B30- prostate, in its entirety sequentially submitted from
apex to base; B31- base of bilateral seminal vesicles and vasa
deferentia where they enter the prostate gland at the base; B32-

2.Focal crushed cells weakly positive for keratin at bladder margin ;see comment.
COMMENT:
Part B ,the ""tissue anterior to seminal vesicle "",demonstrates a small focus of crushed cells within
collagenous stroma at the black-inked edge of the specimen .Immunohistochemical stain for
pancytokeratin on block Bi was performed and highlights these cells, supporting that they represent
epithelial cells .However ,the cytomorphology is too hampered by crush artifact to determine whether
these are benign or malignant epithelial cells. The overall architectural pattern appears infiltrative, and
therefore ,suspicious for carcinoma ,although definitive diagnosis cannot be rendered.
Similarly ,the right bladder margin (slide E15 )demonstrates a small focus of crushed /cauterized cells at
the inked margin ,directly adjacent to deeper bona fide tumor cells. Immunohistochemical stain for
pancytokeratin on block E15 was performed ,which is strongly positive in the tumor cells but weakly
positive in the crushed /cauterized cells. These findings are equivocal for the presence of tumor cells at
the bladder margin.

DIAGNOSIS
(A) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES:
PROSTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA, GLEASON SCORE 9 (4 + 5). (SEE COMMENT)
TUMOR EXTENDING FOCALLY INTO EXTRAPROSTATIC TISSUE.
Margins of resection ,free of tumor.
Right and left seminal vesicles ,no tumor present.
Segments of right and left vasa deferentia ,no tumor present.
PERINEURAL INVASION, PRESENT.
No lymphovascular invasion identified.
PROSTATIC INTRAEPITHELIAL NEOPLASIA (PIN), HIGH GRADE.
: COMMENT
The prostate gland contains two foci of prostatic adenocarcinoma. Both tumor foci are located in the peripheral zone. The
dominant tumor focus is located in the right anterolateral, right lateral, right posterolateral and right posterior peripheral zone. This
tumor focus measures 2.0 x 1.0 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in two cross sections and extensively
in the apex and base region. In the right superior neurovascular bundle region, this tumor focus extends into extraprostatic tissue.
The extent of margin of extraprostatic extension is 4.0 mm. The margin of resection is free of tumor.
The second tumor focus is located in the left posterolateral peripheral zone, exclusively in the apical region. This tumor focus
measures 1.0 x 0.2 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in a single apical section. This tumor is confined
to the prostate. All margins of resection are free of tumor.
GROSS DESCRIPTION
(A)PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A specimen consisting of a prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles and
attached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.The prostate gland (4.7 x 2.7 x 3.0 cm, 28 grams, post fixation) has the usual shape. The soft tissue present along the left
posterolateral aspect of the prostate appears slightly more abundant than along the right side. An area of firmness is noted on the
right side of the prostate. Serial cross sections after fixation demonstrate an area consistent with tumor in the right side of the two
cross sections of the prostate.
The seminal vesicles and segments of vasa deferentia are grossly free of tumor.
Also included in the container are three fragments of tubular structures consistent with vas deferens measuring 2.6 x 0.4 x
0.2 cm, 3.7 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm, 1.2 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm and a fragment of adipose tissue measuring 1.2 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm.

PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
Carcinoma, prostate "," 1. ""Site"": Prostate - as the report clearly specifies the surgical pathology is related to a prostatectomy procedure.
2. ""Laterality"": Both right and left - as the report mentioned the tumor involved both right and left lobes of the prostate gland.
3. ""Histology"": Adenocarcinoma - as the report clearly states the diagnosis is adenocarcinoma, which is the most common type of prostate cancer.
4. ""Stage"": T3a N0 M0 - as per the synoptic report, the tumor has invaded the periprostatic fat but no lymph nodes or distant metastasis were found (pathological staging is based on the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, 7th Edition).
5. ""Grade"": Grade IV (High grade or poorly differentiated) - as the Gleason's grade is 4+3 (score 7/10), which falls under Grade IV according to the Gleason grading system used for prostate cancer.
6. ""Behavior"": Malignant - as the diagnosis is adenocarcinoma, a type of malignant tumor that can spread and invade surrounding tissues.",,,,

Department .Chafrman has been Informed oris aware of the above discrepancy In diagnoses,
Principal k vestigator Signature Date"," 1. ""Site"": Prostate. Justified as the report clearly states ""PROSTATE AND PELVIC LYMPH NODES :RADICAL PROSTATECTOMY:"" and later refers to the prostate gland in multiple sections.
2. ""Laterality"": Not provided. The report does not specify any laterality as it pertains to a radical prostatectomy, where the entire prostate is removed.
3. ""Histology"": Acinar Adenocarcinoma. As stated in the report, ""HISTOLOGIC TYPE ACINAR ADENOCARCINOMA"".
4. ""Stage"": pT3a, pNO, pMX. According to the pathological staging section of the report, ""pT3a, pNO, pMX"" indicates that the tumor has invaded the periprostatic tissue but not the seminal vesicles and there are no metastases.
5. ""Grade"": III (High grade or poorly differentiated). The Gleason score is 9 (4+5), which corresponds to Grade Group 5, the highest grade group, according to the current grading system for prostate cancer.
6. ""Behavior"": Malignant. This is implied as it is a report of a cancer diagnosis, and malignancy is defined by the ability of cancer cells to invade surrounding tissues and potentially spread to distant areas (metastasize).",,,,

Diagnosis -CH-5790 
I. Focally poorly differentiated, max. 1.9 cm, acinar adenocarcinoma of the prostate in both 
lobes with perineural growth along major nerves, focal infiltration of the periprostatic fatty 
connective tissue at several points and with tumor-free seminal vesicles and seminal ducts. 
2. Two tumor-free lipomatous lymph nodes. No malignancy. 
Remark 
Extensive carcinoma infiltrates are found in the peripheral zone of both sides in all sections of 
the prostate. An infiltration of the perisprostatic fatty connective tissue is found along major 
nerves in the right lateral region close to the apex and on the right close to the base. No 
identifiable invasion of the vessels. The left medial patt of the apex shows foci of contact 
between the carcinoma and the blue labeling (diameter about 2 cm). In summary, the tUI1IOI' 
classification is as follows: pT3a, pNO (012), Gleason 3+4 = 7, Gleason 4: 30%, G3, LO, YO. "," 1. ""Site"": Prostate - As the report clearly specifies the diagnosis as acinar adenocarcinoma of the prostate.
2. ""Laterality"": Both - As mentioned in the report, the tumor is present in both lobes of the prostate.
3. ""Histology"": Acinar adenocarcinoma - As stated in the diagnosis and further confirmed by the description in the report.
4. ""Stage"": T3aN0Mx - The tumor has invaded the periprostatic fatty connective tissue (pT3a), but there's no evidence of lymph node or distant metastasis based on the report.
5. ""Grade"": III - The differentiation level is not explicitly stated, but the focal poorly differentiated areas suggest a high-grade tumor (Gleason 3+4=7 with 30% Gleason 4 component).
6. ""Behavior"": Malignant - This is evident from the tumor's invasion of surrounding tissues and perineural growth along major nerves.",,,,

resected 5.0cm from right to left, 4.0cm from anterior to posterior, and 2.3cm from apex to base, with 
attached right and left seminal vesicles and vas deferens. The capsule is tan pink smooth and intact. 
The specimen is inked as follows: Anterior-Orange, Posterior-Black, Apex-Red, Base-Blue, Right­
Green, Left-Yellow. After removal of the apex and base, the remaining prostate weight is 22g. The 
specimen is serially sectioned from apex to base to reveal firm tan fibrous parenchyma. No obvious 
lesions or nodules are grossly identified. The attached right and left seminal vesicles are 4.0 x 2.0 x 
1.0cm and 5.0 x 2.6 x 1.0cm, respectively, are sectioned to beige tan cystic tissue with no gross 
evidence of tumor involvement. The attached right and left segments of vas deferens are 2.5 x OAcm 
and 3.2 x 0.5cm, respectively, are sectioned to reveal firm tan tubular structure with no gross evidence 
of tumor involvement. A portion of the specimen is submitted for tissue procurement (Levels I and III).

Diagnosis 
1. Poorly differentiated, bilateral adenocarcinoma of the prostate across the organ. Maximum 
tumor diameter 5.5 cm. Gleason 4+5=9 (Gleason 5: 20%). Extensive extraprostatic tumor growth 
in the bilateral recto lateral and bilateral basal regions, as well as extensive bilateral infiltration of 
the seminal vesicles. Multifocal tumor involvement of perineural sheaths. Multifocal tumor 
infiltration of the surgical preparation margin in the left basal and right recto lateral region (max. 
contact line 3 mm in the left basal region); Gleason 4 and Gleason 5 pOliions immediately at the 
margin. Multifocal evidence of lymph vessel invasion. No unequivocal evidence of blood vessel 
invasion. 
In addition, numerous foci of a prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (high-grade PIN) and signs of 
myoglandular prostatic hyperplasia. Urothelium of prostatic urethra without dysplasia. 
2. 2 tumor-free lymph nodes. 
3. 1.5 cm carcinoma metastasis without evidence of extranodal tumor growth in one of three 
lymph nodes. 
Summary tumor classification 
pTIb, max. tumor diameter 5.5 cm, Gleason 4+5=9 (Gleason 5 = 20%), Ll, VO, pNI (t/5), Rt. 
Remarl{ 
In contrast to the prior punch biopsies, a Gleason 5 pOliion of 30% is now identifiable in the 
main preparation. 
Additional immunohistochemical studies were initiated to clarity the vascular status. The results 
will be presented in a follow-up report. 
Follow-up report 
Microscopy 
(Immunohistochemistry: CD31, D2-40) 
In the immunohistochemical studies on two representative tumor blocks, there is no evidence to 
suggest the presence of tumorous vessel invasion. 
The final tumor classification is thus as follows: 
pT3a. Gleason 4+5=9 (Gleason 4: 50%, Gleason 4: 30%), pNO (0/3), LO, VO, Rl. "," 1. ""Site"": Prostate. Justified as the report specifically mentions adenocarcinoma of the prostate.
2. ""Laterality"": Not provided. The report does not specify if the cancer is on the left or right side of the prostate.
3. ""Histology"": Adenocarcinoma. This is specified in the report.
4. ""Stage"": pT3a, N0, Mx. Justified as the tumor has grown into the periprostatic tissue (T3), there's no evidence of lymph node metastasis (N0), and no distant metastasis information is provided (Mx).
5. ""Grade"": III or High grade. This is justified as the Gleason score is 4+5=9, which falls under Grade III based on the given scale.

Received fresh labeled with the patient identification and designated as ""Part A, Prostate"" is a 34g 
resected 4.5cm from right to left, 4.0cm from anterior to posterior, and 3.2cm from apex to base, with 
attached right and left seminal vesicles and vas deferens. The capsule is tan pink smooth and intact. 
The specimen is inked as follows: Anterior-Orange, Posterior-Black, Apex-Red, Base-Blue, Right­
Green, Left-Yellow. After removal of the apex and base, the remaining prostate weight is 15g. The 
specimen is serially sectioned from apex to base to reveal firm tan fibrous parenchyma. No obvious 
lesions or nodules are grossly identified. The attached right and left seminal vesicles are 3.0 x 1.0 x 
1.0cm and 4.5 x 1.0 x 1.0cm, respectively, are sectioned to beige tan cystic tissue with no gross 
evidence of tumor involvement. The attached right and left segments of vas deferens are 0.6 x 0.5cm 
and 4.0 x Q,6cm, respectively, are sectioned to reveal firm tan tubular structure with no gross evidence 
of tumor involvement. A portion of the specimen is submitted for tissue procurement (Levels I and III).

PRE·OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
Prostate cancer. 
ADDENDUM: 
The positive margin in this case (slide A6) was reviewed with Dr. and correlated with the gross 
examination and operative report. During the operative procedure there was a surgical violation of the 
prostatic capsule in two places that were marked by surgical sutures for gross examination. One of 
these areas was at the site of the positive margin and comparing this information to the histological 
section it is likely that inked drained through this surgically created cleft. In summary, it is likely that the 
tumor at the inked surface in this slide is not a true margin. "," 1. ""Site"": Prostate. Justified as the report clearly specifies the surgical pathology is related to the prostate gland.

green birefringence on the Congo red stain. This is characteristic of amyloid. Clinical correlation is
recommended."," Site: Prostate gland
Justification: Specimens involved in the pathological analysis are all related to the prostate gland.

Laterality: Right and left side
Justification: The tumor is multifocal, involving both right and left lobes of the prostate gland.

Histology: Adenocarcinoma, conventional type
Justification: The diagnosis indicates adenocarcinoma, which is the most common type of prostate cancer.

Stage: pT2b N X MX
Justification: Based on the pathological staging (pTNM), the tumor has not extended beyond the prostate gland (no extraprostatic extension) and no lymph nodes or distant metastasis were identified. However, the exact stage cannot be determined without additional information about lymph node involvement.

Grade: Gleason's grade 3+4 = 7/10
Justification: The tumor has a Gleason's score of 7, which indicates moderately differentiated cancer with a moderate risk of progression.

In the prior punch biopsies, Gleason 4 and Gleason 5 patterns were also identified. 
Additional immunohistochemical shldies were initiated to clarifY the vascular status. The results 
will be presented in a follow-up repOli. 
Follow-up report 
Immunohistology: CD31, D2-40 
In the meantime, additional immunohistological studies were carried out to establish whether 
there was invasion of blood or lymph vessels. These investigations did not show any evidence 
that the tumor had infiltrated the blood or lymph vessels.

DIAGNOSIS:
A. Right internal/external obturator lymph nodes: Metastatic
prostatic adenocarcinoma in one of nine lymph nodes. The lymph node
metastasis measures 5 mm in maximum diameter; there is no extranodal
extension.
B. Left external iliac lymph nodes: Four lymph nodes negative for
carcinoma.
C. Left internal iliac lymph nodes: Metastatic prostatic
adenocarcinoma in one of three lymph nodes. The metastasis measures
approximately 6 mm in diameter; there is no extranodal extension.
D. Left obturator lymph nodes: Two lymph nodes negative for
carcinoma.
E. Prostate.
Procedure: Radical prostatectomy.
Histologic type:Adenocarcinoma of the prostate, acinar type.
Histologic grade:
Primary pattern: 5, Secondary pattern: 5.
Total Gleason Score: 5+5=10.
The patterns here include comedo carcinoma with central necrosis
and multiple calcifications, fused glands with loss of acini, and
areas showing signet ring cell formation.
Tumor quantitation and location: Carcinoma involves the right and
left sides from apex to base with relative sparing of the left base.
Each section from the right and left sides shows carcinoma measuring
generally in excess of 2 cm in diameter within that block.
Extraprostatic extension:Present. Carcinoma bulges into the
pericapsular adipose tissue in several areass extensively around
both seminal vesicles and posteriorly adjacent to the left apex, the
left midprostate, and the right midprostate.
Margins:The proximal and distal urethral margins are involved by
adenocarcinoma, within distal periurethral prostatic stroma on the
right and left sides in over a diameter of 5-6 mm and within the
proximal periurethral prostatic stroma and urethral mucosa on the
right side in a focus 2 mm in diameter. The apical margins, bladder
neck margins, and pericapsular margins are negative for carcinoma.
Lymph-vascular invasion: Present.
Perineural invasion:Present, extensive throughout the carcinoma
and in the capsule.
Seminal vesicle invasion:Present. The carcinoma extensively
involves the right and left seminal vesicles in foci of
extraprostatic carcinoma up to 2 cm in diameter on both sides. The^ 630-suy

PRINTED"," Based on the given pathology report, here are the categories with some information filled in and others marked as “not provided”:

Site: Prostate and left iliac lymph nodes (provided)
Laterality: Left for the lymph nodes, not provided for the prostate (the prostate specimen includes right and left components, but does not specify whether there is laterality discrepancy in terms of tumor involvement)
Histology: Adenocarcinoma (not explicitly stated, but implied by the description of the prostate tumor)
Stage: Not provided (this would require additional information such as margins and lymph node involvement)
Grade: Not provided (this would require microscopic examination of the specimen)
Behavior: Malignant (implied by the description of the tumor)

Justification for choices:
Site: The report clearly identifies the prostate and left iliac lymph nodes as the specimens in question.
Laterality: While laterality is not explicitly stated for the prostate, it is mentioned that the tumor extends from the apex to the base along the posterior aspect of the specimen, suggesting that there may be involvement on both sides. However, without further information, we cannot definitively say whether there is a laterality discrepancy.
Histology: The report describes a prostate tumor with specific dimensions and characteristics, implying adenocarcinoma as the histologic diagnosis.
Stage: The report does not provide enough information to determine the stage of either the prostate cancer or the lymph node involvement.
Grade: The report does not provide enough information to determine the grade of the prostate cancer.
Behavior: The report describes a grossly evident tumor in the prostate, indicating malignant behavior.",,Left,,

Gross Description: Prostatic tumor is ill-margin, with 2x2x1.5cm that are cut into many specimens, firm
and gray surface.
Microscopic Description: Tumor is invasion into stroma and bladder wall. Tumor architecture is
composed of sheets or groups or single or glands seperated by fibrous septa, intervening muscle
bundles. Cytoplasm are moderate and eosinophilic. Mitotic index is common. Nuclei are hyperchromatic
and very irregularly enlarged and prominent nucleoli. Tumor is necrotic and hemorrhage. Stroma is
fibrous. Transitional cells are hyperplastic and begnin.

COMMENT
The prostate gland contains a single focus of prostatic adenocarcinoma. The tumor is located in the left anterolateral, left lateral,
left posterolateral, left posterior, mid posterior, right posterior, right posterolateral, and right lateral peripheral zone. The tumor
focus 3.0 x 2.0 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension, and it is present in the four cross sections and extensively in the apex
and base regions. The tumor exhibits extraprostatic extension in the left superior neurovascular bundle region (less than 1.0 mm).
In addition, tumor is also present in left perivesicular soft tissue (less than 1.0 mm). No invasion of the seminal vesicle proper ispresent.
Please refer to the previous report for the diagnosis of the pelvic lymph nodes.
GROSS DESCRIPTION
(E) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A specimen consisting of a prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles and
attached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.
The prostate gland (5.1 x 2.5 x 3.5 cm, 31 grams, post-fixation) has the usual shape. The soft tissue present along the
right and left posterolateral aspects of the prostate appears symmetrical. A nodule is palpated on the left side of the prostate.
Serial cross sections after fixation demonstrate firm areas consistent with tumor in the left lateral and left posterolateral peripheralzone of cross sections 2-4.
The seminal vesicles and segments of vasa deferentia are grossly free of tumor.
SECTION CODE: El-E4, right seminal vesicle and segment of right vas deferens from the base towards the tip; E5-E8,
left seminal vesicle and segment of left vas deferens from the base towards the tip; E9, prostaticbase , right border; E10, E11, prostatic base, right posterior border; E12-E17, prostatic base, central portion; E18, prostaticbase , left border; E19-E21, prostatic

The immunohistochemical stains show PSA expression in the glands, confinnlng prostatic origin. Immunohistochemical 
stains show expression of racemase in these glands. Presence of basal cells is confirmed by CK903 and p63 
immunohistochemical stains. 
This Immunohistochemical profile suggests these glands represent high grade prostatic intraepithellal neoplasia. No

Page 1 of 5 COMMENT:
The left posterior apical margin specimen submitted for frozen section (part B )contains a focus of
glandular epithelium with complex architecture ,but without an Infiltrative appearance.
Immunohistochemical stains for p63 and HMWK were obtained on this specimen and the focus in
question is negative for basal cells .These results support our interpretation that this focus represents
prostatic adenocarcinoma.
In addition ,cauterized glands highly suspicious for adenocarcinoma are present at the Inked ,cauterized
apical margin of the main specimen (slides 31 and J2). Immunohistochemical stains for p63 and HMWK
were obtained on block 12 in order to evaluate these glands .The glands in question are negative for
basal cells, supporting the interpretation of these foci as adenocarcinoma and our interpretation that
this represents tumor at the Inked ,cauterized margin .Of note ,the separately submitted anterior apical
margin (part G )and posterior apical margin (part H )are negative for carcinoma .Correlation with
operative findings is required in order to determine the final margin status.

Gross Description
The specimen is received in ten parts, each labeled with the patient's name and medical record number.
Parts A, B. and ] are received fresh. The remainder of the parts are received in formalin.
Part A, additionally labeled ""right posterior base - frozen section,"" consists of an irregular, unoriented,
red-tan soft tissue fragment (1 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm). The entire specimen is frozen for frozen section
diagnosis 1, and subsequently submitted in cassette Al. 1
Part B, additionally labeled ""left posterior apex margin -FS,"" consists of a piece of irregular ,unoriented,
red-tan soft tissue (0.8 x 0 .6 x 0.2 cm). The entire specimen is frozen for frozen section diagnosis 2,
and subsequently submitted in cassette Bi. „J
Part C, additionally labeled ""right external iliac lymph nodes ,""consists of a single irregular, unoriented,
yellow -tan fibrofatty tissue fragment (4.5 x 2 .5 x 0.7 cm). Examination reveals two ovoid, firm,
light-tan lymph node candidates (both approximately 1.3 cm )which are bisected and entirely submitted
in cassette Ci.. I
Part D ,additionally labeled ""right obturator lymph nodes ,""consists of multiple soft to firm, irregular,
yellow -tan, fibrofatty tissue fragments (4 x 3 x 1 cm in aggregate ).Examination reveals three firm,
irregular ,light-tan lymph node candidates (1.3 cm -1.7 cm) which are submitted as follows:
D1: One lymph node candidate, bisected.
D2: One lymph node candidate ,bisected.
D3: One lymph node candidate, bisected.
Part E ,additionally labeled ""left external iliac lymph node ,""consists of multiple soft to firm, irregular,
yellow -tan fibrofatty tissue fragments (3.5 x 3 x i cm in aggregate). Examination reveals four firm,
light-tan lymph node candidates (0.5 cm -1.7 cm ),which are submitted as follows:

prostate received with attached bilateral adnexa having 
overall dimensions of 6.5 x 3.5 x 0.5 cm. The capsule is' 
tan-gray and shaggy. The specimen is inked as follows: right 
side blue, left side black. The base and apical margins are 
coned and serially sectioned. The remainder of the gland is 
serially sectioned from apex to base to reveal a 1.5 x 1.0 x 
0.8 cm, well-circumscribed, yellow-tan nodule located in the 
right posterior quadrant. This nodule abuts the inked 
capsule. Additionally, a 2.5 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm, ill-defined 
area of tan-orange discoloration is present within the right 
and left posterior quadrants. This area approaches to within 
0.5 cm of the base margin and to within 0.2 cm of the right 
prostate/seminal vesicle junction. The remainder of the cut 
surface is pink-tan and focally cystic with diffuse 
periurethral nodularity. No additional lesions or calculi 
are identified. Representative sections are submitted in

DIAGNOSIS
(E) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES:
PROSTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA, GLEASON SCORE 9 (4+5). (SEE COMMENT)
TUMOR CONFINED TO THE PROSTATE.
MARGINS OF RESECTION FREE OF TUMOR. RECUTS PENDING.
PROSTATIC INTRAEPITHELIAL NEOPLASIA (PIN), HIGH-GRADE.
Right and left seminal vesicles ,no tumor present.
Segments of right and left vasa deferentia ,no tumor present.
COMMENT
The prostate gland contains four separate foci of prostatic adenocarcinoma ,two in the peripheral zone and two in the transition
zone. The dominant tumor focus is located in the left lateral ,left posterolateral and left posterior peripheral zone .This tumor
focus measures 1.8 x 1 .0 cm in the largest cross -sectional dimension and it is present in two cross sections and focally in the apex
and base regions .The second tumor focus is located in the right posterolateral peripheral zone ,exclusively in the base region.
This tumor focus measures 0.8 x 0 .4 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in three base sections. The third
tumor focus is located in the right transition zone .This tumor focus measures 0.4 x 0 .1cm in the largest cross -sectional
dimension and it is present in two cross sections and focally in the apical region. The fourth tumor focus is located in the left
transition zone .This tumor focus measures 0.4 x 0.1 cm in the largest cross -sectional dimension and it is present in two cross
sections and focally in the apical region .All tumor foci are confined to the prostate .The margins of resection are free of tumor.
GROSSDESCRIPTI ON
(E) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A specimen consisting of a prostate ,attached right and left seminal vesicles and
attached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.
The prostate gland (4.5 x 3. 5 x 3.8 cm, 34 grams ,post fixation )has the usual shape .The soft tissue present along the
left posterolateral aspect of the prostate appears slightly more abundant than along the right side .A tumor is palpated on the left
base region .Serial cross sections after fixation demonstrate a firm area consistent with tumor in the left peripheral zone of the two
cross sections of the prostate.
The seminal vesicles and segments of vasa deferentia are grossly free of tumor.

perineural Invasion Henow undergoes a robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.
Gross Description
The specimen is received in two parts, each labeled with the patient' s name and medical record number.
Part A is received in formalin .Part B is received fresh.
Part A ,labeled ""anterior prostatic fat,"" consists of multiple soft ,irregular pieces of yellow ,fibrofatty
tissue (4.4 x 2 .9 x 1.2 cm in aggregate ).No masses or candidate lymph nodes are found. The
specimen is entirely submitted in cassette Al.
Part B ,labeled ""prostate gland and seminal vesicles ,""consists of a radical prostatectomy specimen (76
gm; 4 cm from apex to base x 5 cm in width x 4 cm from anterior to posterior).
GROSS PATHOLOGIC FINDINGS :There are two nodules .Nodule 1 (1.5 x 1 .2 x 0.6 cm) is ill defined,
rubbery and yellow .It is located in the right posterior gland (slices 4-10) and abuts the posterior
margin .Nodule 2 (0.8 x 0 .4 x 0.3 cm )is ill defined ,rubbery and yellow .It is located in the left
posterior gland (slices 5 -7) and is 0.3 cm from the posterior margin .The anterior fibrous stroma is red,
roughened and is open .The remaining capsule is intact .The remaining prostatic parenchyma is tan.
The seminal vesicle /vas deferens bundles (right 3 x 2.5 x 0.5 cm ;left 3 x 2 x 0.5 cm )are soft ,lobulated

Diagnosis 
I. Predominantly poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the prostate on both sides with 
predominance in the anterior and right rectolateral peripheral zone. Maximum tumor spread 
0.9 cm. Focally perineural tumor invasion. No extraprostatic tumor growth and no identifiable 
invasion of the vessels. Tumor-free seminal vesicles and tumor-free resection margins.

4. Five tumor-free lymph nodes. 
5. Two tumor-free lymph nodes. 
6. Fatty tissue with a tumor-free, microscopic lymph node. 
7. Fatty tissue with five tumor-free lymph nodes. 
Remark 
III summarv. the tumor is classified as follows: 
pT2c, pNO (0119), LO, YO; Gleason 4+3 = 7 (approx. 60% Gleason 4); complete local resection. "," 1. ""Site"": Prostate. Justified as the report clearly states the tumor is located in the prostate.
2. ""Laterality"": Not provided. The report does not specify if the tumor is only on the right, left, or both sides, so we can't definitively provide this information.
3. ""Histology"": Predominantly poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. As stated in the diagnosis, the predominant type of cancer found is adenocarcinoma, and it is primarily poorly differentiated.
4. ""Stage"": pT2c, pNO (0119). This is based on the TNM staging system where 'pT2c' indicates the tumor has invaded both peripheral zones of the prostate, and 'pNO (0119)' suggests no evidence of regional lymph node metastasis.
5. ""Grade"": Grade III (High grade or poorly differentiated). The report mentions the tumor is predominantly poorly differentiated, which corresponds to Grade III.
6. ""Behavior"": Malignant. This is inferred from the fact that it's a cancer (cancerous behavior) and the report mentions perineural tumor invasion, indicating the tumor is invading surrounding tissues.",,,,

COMMENT
The prostate gland contains a single focus of prostatic adenocarcinoma .The tumor occupies approximately 70% of the prostatic
volume and measures 3.9 x 3.8 cm in the largest cross sectional dimension and it is present in the two cross sections of the
prostate and extensively in the apex and base regions. The tumor exhibits extraprostatic extension in multiple areas including the
left anterior prostatic surface ,anterior apex, bladder neck and left superior neurovascular bundle region. Tumor extensively
involves the margin of resection including anterior apex (added length 26.0 mm )and anterior bladder neck (added length, 10.0
mm). Tumor extensively involves both seminal vesicles including the intra and extraprostatic portions as well as perivesicular soft
tissue .lmmunoperoxidase studies for chromogranin and synaptophysin demonstrate focally rare immunoreactive cells, supporting
the presence of cells with neuroendocrine differentiation .The amount of immunoreactive cells is within the spectrum observed inhigh grade carcinomas .The stains for PSA and PAP show dissuse strong immunoreactivity .The tumor exhibits focal mucinousdifferentiation.

COMMENT
The prostate gland contains a single focus of prostatic adenocarcinoma. The tumor measures 3.5 x 2.5 cm in the largest
cross-sectional dimension and it is present in the two cross sections of the prostate and extensively in the apex and base. The
tumor involves the right anterolateral, right lateral, right posterolateral, right posterior, mid posterior, left posterior and left lateral
peripheral zone with extension into the right and left transition zone. The tumor exhibits extraprostatic extension in multiple areas
and extends to the margin of resection on the anterior and right apical region. The added length of marginal involvement is 6.0
mm. The tumor invades the right seminal vesicle.
Please refer to the previous report for the diagnosis of the pelvic lymph nodes.
GROSS DESCRIPTION
(C) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A specimen consisting of a prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles and
attached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.
The prostate gland (4.9 x 4.0 x 4.5 cm, 30.0 grams, post-fixation) has the usual shape. The soft tissue present along the
right posterolateral aspect of the prostate is abundant and more extensive than along the left side. Nodules are palpated on the
right and left sides of the prostate. Serial cross-sections after fixation demonstrate areas consistent with tumor, involving the right
and left sides of the two cross sections of the prostate.
The seminal vesicles and segments of vasa deferentia are grossly free of tumor.
SECTION CODE: C1-C4, right seminal vesicle and segment of right vas deferens from the base towards the tip; C5-C8,
left seminal vesicle and segment of left vas deferens from the base towards the tip; C9, C 10, prostatic base, right border;

Stage: Not provided in the report, but extensive extraprostatic extension, invasion into the right seminal vesicle, and involvement of the margin of resection are mentioned.
Grade: Gleason score 9 (4 + 5)
Behavior: Malignant

Justification for the choice: The report specifically mentions the diagnosis of prostatic adenocarcinoma with a Gleason score of 9, indicating a high-grade tumor. There is also extensive extraprostatic extension and involvement of the right seminal vesicle, suggesting that the cancer has spread beyond the prostate gland. The involvement of the margin of resection indicates that some cancer cells are present at the edge of the surgical specimen, increasing the risk of recurrence. Therefore, based on the information provided in the report, I have categorized this as a high-grade and locally advanced prostate cancer with a poor prognosis.",,,,

previously sectioned, markedly distorted prostate gland with
attached fragments of apparent seminal vesicles. The specimen is
received after tissue harvest for .Within the specimen
container are three tissue cassettes labeled .The
prostate fragments with apparent attached seminal vesicles weigh as
received 52.5 grams and measure on reconstruction approximately 5.4
x 4.6 x 4.5 cm. The outer surface is markedly shaggy. The cut
surface shows markedly gritty gray tan fibrotic cut surface with
focal punctate areas of chalky discoloration extending throughout
the entire distal. and mid region of the specimen focally nta the
proximal area (near the vesical) margin. The urethra appears to be
compressed. This tissue occupies a total area of approximately 4.5
x 4.0 k 4.0 cm and grossly appears to extend to the apical (distal)
margin and to several inked lateral margins. The lesion grossly
extends to the seminal vesicles which appear to be grossly
fragmented. The portions of the seminal vesicles together are 2.5 x
2.0 x 0.9. cm with lobulated gray tan outer surfaces and multicystic
gray tan fibrotic cut surfaces. Also received in the same container
are three elongated fragments of soft gray tan tissue which appear
to be tubular with pinpoint lumen. They measure from 2.0 x 0.4 x.

Comments
Histologic sections demonstrate extensive involvement by high grade
prostatic adenocarcinoma. Much of the prostate is replaced by tumor.
Prominent areas of cribriforming are noted; multiple areas of single
cells infiltrating through thestrama are also present. Extensive
involvement of the seminal vesicles (both right and left) is. seen;
tumor extension to multiple soft tissue margins of resection,
including along perineural tracts, is seen. Involvement of both the
a ical as well as bladder neck margins is seen. Clinical correlation and correlation with intraoperative findings is recommended.
At the request of the undersigned pathologist for quality assurance
purposes, these slides have been additionally reviewed by Dr.
who concu rs with the diagnosis.

"," 1. ""Site"": Prostate. Justified as the report clearly specifies the removal and examination of the prostate gland.
2. ""Laterality"": Both left and right sides. This is evident as the tumor was found in the left lateral portion of the prostate, and sections were taken from both the right and left sides.
3. ""Histology"": Adenocarcinoma. The pre-operative diagnosis suggests carcinoma, and the final review confirms this, but the gross dictation mentions a ""yellow-tan ill-defined mass"" which is consistent with adenocarcinoma.
4. ""Stage"": Not provided. The report does not contain information about the stage of the cancer.
5. ""Grade"": Gleason score 7 (3+4). This is determined from the microscopic/diagnostic dictation where the pathologist describes the tumor as having a Gleason score of 3+4.
6. ""Behavior"": Invasive. The tumor is described as approaching the surface at a distance of 0.2 cm, indicating it is an invasive cancer.",,,,

Although we Identified extraprostatie extension by the tumor in the right base, we did not identify tumor at the margin of
the prostatectomy specimen. However, tumor is present in the separate urethral tissue arguing that the final margin
status is actually positive :Clinical .correlation with the sites of the tissues taken is recommended.

Prepared for"," Based on the pathology report, here are the details for the six categories:

1. Site: The prostate gland is the site of origin, which is not explicitly mentioned in the report but can be inferred from the context.
2. Laterality: Not provided in the report.
3. Histology: Adenocarcinoma, which is the most common type of prostate cancer.
4. Stage: The report mentions that the tumor has a stage T2c, which means it is still confined to the prostate gland but has invaded both lobes.
5. Grade: The grade is not explicitly mentioned in the report, but it can be inferred from the Gleason score of 7 (3+4), which indicates a moderately differentiated tumor.
6. Behavior: Malignant, as it is an adenocarcinoma with a Gleason score of 7.

Justification: The site is inferred from the context, laterality is not provided, histology is mentioned as adenocarcinoma, stage is explicitly stated as T2c, grade is inferred from the Gleason score, and behavior is malignant based on the Gleason score and the fact that it is an adenocarcinoma.",,,,

-Estimated volume of tumor :7.7 cc.
-Gleason score :4+5; primary pattern 4, secondary pattern 5.
-Estimated volume > Gleason pattern 3 :80%.
- Involvement of capsule :Tumor invades capsule (right posterior base ,slide H8; left posterior apex,
slide H9; left posterior mid gland, slide H10; left anterior base, slide H14; left posterior base,
slide H18).
-Extraprostatic extension :Present, extensive (slides H9-H10, H14, H18).
- Margin status for tumor :Tumor cells are present <0.1 cm away from the margin. No definite
tumor cells are Identified at the inked margin.
However, rare cauterized glands (<0.1 cm In maximum dimension) that are too distorted by
cautery to better classify are present at the left posterior base (slide H18).
Finally, on frozen section FS3 ""posterior midline,"" there is a small focus of cauterized epithelioid
cells which most likely represent plump endothelial cells of a small capillary but due to distortion,
this possibility of this representing a small focus of prostatic adenocarclnoma cannot be
completely excluded. This focus of cells is no longer present on permanent sections.
-Margin status for benign prostate glands :No benign glands present at inked excision margins.
-High-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN ):Present; focally.
-Tumor involvement of seminal vesicle :Present; bilateral.

Microscopic Description:
Complete microscopic evaluation has been performed.
Appropriately reacting controls have been performed and
evaluated for all stains on this case as required.
Histopathology has a list of IH antibodies that are regulated
as
analyte specific reagents (ASR's). These assays were
developed
and their performance characteristics determined by the
Histopathology Laboratory in the Department of Pathology at
They
have not been cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration.
The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not
necessary for the ASR's. These tests are not investigational
and are used in standard clinical care. In cases where
Immunohistochemistry testing is performed, the following
antibodies and their respective clones may be used to
determine
therapy for the patient: EFGR(3c6), ER(SP1), PR(1E2),
Her2neu (4B5) , CD117 (Poly) , CD20 (L26) Ki67 (30-9) .
Unless otherwise stated in the report, all tissue tested for
ERPR by IHC, Her2 by IHC and/or HER2 by FISH have been fixed
as
per C.A.P. requirements for a minimum of 6 hours and a maximum
of 48 hours.
ER, PR, Ki-67, p53 are reported as a semi-quantitative
percentage of positively stained nuclei. Her-2/neu and EGFR
are
scored as follows: No staining at all is scored as (0), weak,
incomplete membrane staining in any proportion of cells is
scored as (1+), less than strong but complete staining in any
proportion of cells or complete strong staining in less than
30%
of cells is scored as (2+), and strong complete staining in
more
that 30% of cells is scored as (3+). All studies are
rinted by"," Site: Bladder neck and prostate
Laterality: Not provided (as it is a bilateral procedure)
Histology: Adenocarcinoma with lymphovascular invasion
Stage: pT3aNOMX (pT3a indicates tumor has invaded beyond the prostate capsule, NX indicates that regional lymph nodes were not assessed for metastasis, and MX indicates that distant metastasis was not assessed)
Grade: Not provided (usually based on Gleason score which is not mentioned in the report)
Behavior: Malignant (as it is a cancer diagnosis)

Justification: The site is identified as the bladder neck and prostate, stage is determined by the pathologic findings, grade is not provided but can be inferred from other reports, and behavior is malignant based on the context of the report.",,,,

PRE·OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
Prostate carcinoma "," Site: Prostate gland
Justification: The specimen includes a radical prostatectomy and the diagnosis confirms prostatic adenocarcinoma.

Laterality: Bilateral
Justification: The tumor involves both right and left lobes of the prostate, with seminal vesicle involvement on both sides.

Histology: Adenocarcinoma
Justification: The diagnosis confirms a prostatic adenocarcinoma based on histological examination and immunohistochemical staining.

Stage: pT4
Justification: The tumor involves the muscular wall of the seminal vesicles, bladder neck, and left base with proximal urethral margin, indicating a T4 stage according to the TNM staging system.

Grade: Gleason score 7 (3+4)
Justification: The tumor has a Gleason score of 7 (3+4), which is considered moderately differentiated and associated with an intermediate risk of progression.

Behavior: Malignant
Justification: Prostatic adenocarcinoma is a malignant neoplasm, meaning it can invade surrounding tissues, spread to distant organs, and potentially lead to death if left untreated.",,,,

Source of Specimen: 
Prostate 
Clinical History/Operative Ox: 
Malignant neoplasm prostate 
Gross Description: 
The specimen is labeled prostate and is received in formalin. It consists of a prostatectomy specimen 
weighing 52 grams. The prostate gland measures 4.5 x 4 x 3.5 cm and weighs 52 grams. It includes a 2.3 
x 1.2 x 1 cm portion of right seminal vesicle, a 1 cm segment of right vas deferens, a 1.2 cm segment of 
left vas deferens, and a 2 x 1.7 x 0.8 cm left seminal vesicle. The right anterior surface of the prostate is 
inked blue, the left anterior surface is inked green, and the posterior surface is inked black. The prostatic 
apex, bladder neck, and seminal vesicles/vasa are trimmed. The prostate is divided into right and left 
halves and is sectioned from apex to bladder neck. In the apical third of the right prostate, there is a 0.7 
cm circumscribed area of firm yellowish discoloration suggestive of neoplasm. There is very patchy, small, 
yellowish discoloration of the corresponding portion of the left apical prostate. The prostatic gland 
parenchyma is otherwise tan and shows bulging yellow nodularity in the periurethral region bilaterally. 
Also in the specimen container are three cylindrical fragments of pale tan tissue suggestive of portions of 
vasa varying from 1.1-1.8 cm in length and up to 0.4 cm in diameter. Representative sections are 
submitted. Section summary: A1) right prostatic apex, A2) left prostatic apex, A3) right bladder neck, A4) 
left bladder neck, A5) surgical margin right vas deferens, right seminal vesicle, A6) surgical margin left vas 
deferens, left seminal vesicle, A7-A22) prostate, apex-bladder nec~, A23) sections of separate tissue .• 
Microscopic Description: 
Microscopic sections have been examined. The microscopic findings are reflected in the diagnosis 
rendered. "," 1. ""Site"": Prostate. Justification: The report clearly states the specimen is a radical prostatectomy and the clinical history mentions a malignant neoplasm of the prostate.
2. ""Laterality"": Both right and left. Justification: The report mentions that the tumor involves both the right and left prostate.
3. ""Histology"": Prostatic adenocarcinoma. Justification: The diagnosis section of the report clearly states this.
4. ""Stage"": pT2c, pNX, pMX. Justification: The Pathologic Tumor Staging Synopsis provides these details. pT2c indicates the tumor has invaded beyond the prostate gland but not into the seminal vesicles. pNX means regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed, and pMX indicates distant metastasis cannot be assessed.
5. ""Grade"": Not provided. Justification: The Gleason score is provided (3 + 4 = 7), but this does not directly correlate with the grades you mentioned. It's a measure of tumor grade in prostate cancer, but it doesn't fit neatly into the categories of low, intermediate, high, or undifferentiated grade.
6. ""Behavior"": Malignant. Justification: The report clearly states a diagnosis of malignant neoplasm (cancer) in the prostate.",,,,

COMMENT
The prostate gland contains three separate foci of prostatic adenocarcinoma. All tumor foci are located in the peripheral zone.
The dominant tumor focus is located in the right anterolateral, right lateral, right posterolateral and mid posterior peripheral zone.
This tumor focus measures 2.0 x 1.8 cm in the largest cross sectional dimension and it is present in the three cross sections of the
prostate and extensively in the apex and base regions. This tumor focus exhibits in the right posterolateral aspect of the prostate,
right superior neurovascular bundle region and bladder neck region, extension into extraprostatic adipose tissue. The added
length of extraprostatic tumor is 26.0 mm. The margin of resection is free of tumor but tumor extends focally (right apex) to less
than 0.1 mm from the inked margin of resection. The second largest tumor focus is located in the left anterolateral and left lateral
peripheral zone. This tumor focus measures 0.4 x 0.3 cm in the largest cross sectional dimension and it is present in two cross
sections and focally in the apical region. The third tumor focus is located in the left posterior peripheral zone. This tumor focus
measures 0.4 x 0.3 cm in the largest cross sectional dimension and it is present in two cross sections. The non-dominant tumor
foci are of lower histologic grade (Gleason score 6) and are confined to the prostate.
The dominant tumor focus exhibits Gleason grade 3, 4, and 5. The Gleason grade 5 component is located predominantly in the
right lateral and right anterolateral aspect of the tumor.
GROSS DESCRIPTION
(C) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A specimen consisting of a prostate ,attached right and left seminal vesicles and
attached segments of right and left vasa differentia.
The prostate gland (6.4 x 3.3 x 3.5 cm ,49 grams ,post fixation )has the usual shape .The soft tissue present along the right
and left posterolateral aspects of the prostate appears symmetrical. Tumor is palpated in the right posterolateral aspect of the
prostate from the apex to the base .Serial cross sections have post fixation demonstrating a firm area in the right peripheral zone
of the three cross sections of the prostate.
The seminal vesicles and segments of vasa differentia are grossly free of tumor.

4. ""Stage"": pT2c NO. This is provided directly in the clinical history section of the report.
5. ""Grade"": The Gleason score is 6/10, which typically corresponds to a Grade Group 1 (low grade or well-differentiated) based on the current WHO grading system. However, it's important to note that uropathologists often use a slightly different interpretation of the Gleason score, so this might be better interpreted by a specialist in this field.

COMMENT
The prostate gland contains a single focus of prostatic adenocarcinoma. The tumor involves the right anterolateral, right lateral
and right posterolateral peripheral zone with extension into the right transition zone. The tumor focus measures 2.5 x 1.5 cm in the
largest cross-sectional dimension, and it is present in the three cross-sections of the prostate, extensively in the apex, and focally
in the base region. The tumor is confined to the prostate. The margins of resection are free of tumor.
GROSS DESCRIPTION
(C) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES -A specimen consisting of a prostate ,attached right and left seminal vesicles and
attached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.
The prostate gland (4.5 x 2. 9 x 4.6 cm ,37.5 grams ,post-fixation )has the usual shape .The soft tissue present along the
right posterolateral aspect of the prostate appears more abundant than along the left side. A nodule is palpated in the right
posterolateral aspect of the prostate .Serial cross -sections after fixation demonstrate an area consistent with tumor in the right
peripheral zone extending from the first to the third cross -sections.
The seminal vesicles and segments of vasa deferentia are grossly free of tumor.

Diagnosis 
I. Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the prostate in the left rectolateral and basal 
peripheral zone. Maximum tumor spread 2.6 cm. Extensive perineural infiltration and 
extraprostatic tumor growth in the left recto lateral and basal region. Infiltration of the left seminal 
vesicle. Infiltration of the surgical margins in the left recto lateral and basal resection. 
2. Tumor-free fatty connective tissue with vessels and nerves 
3. Fatty tissue with two tumor-free lymph nodes. 
4. Fatty tissue with three tumor-free lymph nodes. 
Remark 
The tumor classification to date is as follows: 
pTIb; Gleason 5+4 = 9 with small tertimy Gleason 3 portion (approx. 95% Gleason 5/4). 
In the left lateral and basal region, carcinoma cells extend in a multifocal and elongated pattern 
the preparation margin (blue labeling, contact surface max. 8 mm and about 17 mm wide 
altogether). 
To be on the safe side, additional immunohistological shldies will follow to establish whether 
there is any invasion of the vessels and any lymph node metastases that could not yet be 
detected. The results will be presented in a follow-up repOlt. 
Follow-up report 
Diagnosis already reported 
Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the prostate 
Immunohistology (CD31) also showed no evidence for invasion of the vessels. In the 
submitted lymph nodes mentioned under 3. and 4., immunohistology also showed no 
metastases and no disseminated tumor cells. 
Concluding tumor classification 
pTIb, pNO (0/3), La, va; Gleason 5+4=9. 
At the request ofthe clinician, an additional immunohistological investigation will be carried 
out to settle the question of chromatin expression. The results will be presented in a follow­
up repOlt. "," 1. ""Site"": Prostate - The report clearly states the diagnosis as ""Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the prostate"".
2. ""Laterality"": Left - As per the report, the tumor is located in the left rectolateral and basal peripheral zone.
3. ""Histology"": Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma - The report explicitly mentions the histology as ""Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the prostate"".
4. ""Stage"": pTIb; Gleason 5+4 = 9 - The tumor is limited to the prostate gland (T1) and has extended into the perineural space and extraprostatic tissue (Tib). The Gleason score, which is a measure of how aggressive the cancer is, is 5+4=9.
5. ""Grade"": Not provided - The report mentions the Gleason score, which is a measure of tumor grade, but it doesn't explicitly state the grade in the traditional Grade I-IV format.

Diagnosis 
I. Prostate: poorly differentiated bilateral adenocarcinoma of the prostate across the organ, 
mainly in the peripheral zone (Gleason 4+5=9 with minimal Gleason 3 portion; Gleason 4: 
approx. 90%, Gleason 5: 5%, Gleason 3: <5%). Maximum tumor diameter 33 mm. Tumor 
involves approx. 80% of total gland. Tumor infiltration of right basal periprostatic fatty 
tissue (infiltration front I mm wide, 0.5mm deep). Extensive bilateral seminal vesicle 
involvement. Extensive perineural tumor infiltration. Tumor contact with the color-labeled 
surgical resection margin in the left anterior region on a block level (contact line 1.5 mm; 
Gleason pattern 4 here). Lymph vessel invasion by the tumor in places. 
Additional foci of a prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (high-grade PIN) and signs of 
myoglandular prostatic hyperplasia. Urothelium of prostatic urethra without dysplasia. 
2. Right external lymph nodes: a lymph node with a 1.2 cm carcinoma metastasis. 
Three tumor-free lymph nodes (1/4). 
3. Right obdurator fossa: a tumor-free lymph node (011). 
4. Right internal lymph nodes: tumor-free fatty tissue resection material with a tumor-free 
microscopic lymph node (Oil). 
5. Left external lymph nodes: two tumor-free lymph nodes (0/2). 
6. Lymph nodes of left obdurator fossa: two lymph node carcinoma metastases 
measuring up to 3.5 cm and extending over the capsule (2/2). 
7. Left internal lymph nodes: tumor-free fatty tissue with tumor-free palts of a 
microscopic lymph node (011). 
Tumor classification 
pTIb, maximum tumor diameter 33 mm. Tumor involving approx. 80% of the total prostate, 
Gleason 4+5=9 with minimal Gleason 3 pOitions (Gleason 4: approx. 90%, Gleason 5: 5%, 
Gleason 3: <5%), Ll, RI, pNI (3111) 
Remark 
In the prior punch biopsies carcinoma tissue was obtained at all sampling sites with an overall 
Gleason pattern of 4+3=7 with teltimy grade 5. This prostatectomy preparation thus shows an 
overall pattern of 4+5=9 with small Gleason 3 pOitions on the basis of the larger Gleason 5 
portion, as described above. 
Follow-up report 
Immunohistochemistry: 2x CD240 and CD31 (BR4, BL2). 
The repOited immunohistochemical investigation of the adenocarcinoma of the prostate showed 
lymph vessel invasion. There was no evidence of blood vessel invasion. 
Final tumor classification: 
pTIb, maximum tumor diameter 3.3 cm, tumor involves 80% of the prostate in total, Gleason 
4+5=9 minimal Gleason 3 tumor (Gleason 4: 90%, Gleason 5: 5%, Gleason 3: < 5%), Ll, YO, 
pNI (3111), R1. "," 1. ""Site"": Prostate. This is mentioned in the diagnosis section where the report specifically states 'I. Prostate'.
2. ""Laterality"": Bilateral. The report mentions 'poorly differentiated bilateral adenocarcinoma of the prostate'.

Tumor classification
(inconsideration of the intraoperative frozen-section, parallel report and immunohistochemical
analyses):
pT4, Gleason 5+4=9 (Gleason 5: 70%, Gleason 4: 30%), maximum tumor diameter: 38 mm, tumor
volume approx. 20.6 ml (Gleason 5: 14.4 ml, Gleason 4: 6.2 ml), pN1 (2/16), L1, V0, R1
Comments:
Tumor infiltration of both seminal vesicles in tissue blocks BR1B, BR2B, BR3A, SBR1,
SBR2, BL1B, BL2A, BL2B, BL3A, BL3B.
Tumor infiltration into peri-prostatic adipose tissue in tissue blocks AR1B, BR1B, SBR2,
SBL1, SBL2, SBL3, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, and A7.
In the preceding intraoperative frozen section prostatic adenocarcinoma with positive
surgical margin was found on both sides.
The consequently bilateral neurovascular resection revealed tumor infiltration on both
sides. In addition, there was a questionable tumor infiltration in the sample,,apex, right
side"" and tumor infiltration in the sample ""sphincter, right side"". The parallel samples
""secondary resection material, bladder neck"" and ""secondary resection margin, left
pedicle"" revealed tumor infiltration.
It can be assumed, that the positive lateral surgical margin on both sides (tissue block
ARIA, R1A, LA1A, L2A, L2B) are covered by the bilateral neurovascular resection.
The contact sites in the prostatic base (BR1A, BR1B, BR2A, BR2B, BR3A, BL1A, BL1B,
BL2A, BL2B, BL3A, and BL4A) may be covered by the attached urinary bladder wall.
However, due to positive surgical margin in tissue blocks SBR1, SBR2, SBL2, Al, A2, A3,
A4, A5, A6, A7, A8 and A9 as well a tumor infiltration of the frozen section ""sphincter
right"" and the sample ""secondary resection material, bladder neck"" and ""secondary
resection material, left pedicle"" of the parallel sample it has to be assumed that the
tumor was not entirely resected.
In addition, there was an additional lymph node metastasis (1/1) in the pre-prostatic
adipose tissue in a parallel sample.
Immunohistochemical analyses (D2-40, CD31) revealed lymphatic invasion. Venous
vasion was not detected. One macroscopic image for tumor mapping.

ranging between 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.2 through 1.7 x 0.8 x 0.3 cm. The specimen is submitted as follows:
Cassette 81: Three candidate lymph nodes.
Cassette B2: Remaining fatty tissue.
Part C, received fresh and additionally labeled ""prostate and SV,"" consists of a 49-gram prostate gland
with intact seminal vesicles/vas deferens bundles. The gland measures 4.0 cm medial-lateral, 3.5 cm
apex-base, and 4.0 cm anterior-posterior. The external surface of the gland is soft, red-tan and is
received with a single suture and a single metal clip. The seminal vesides/vas deferens bundles are soft
and red-tan. The left measures 4.5 x 2.5 x 1.0 cm and the right measures 3.5 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm. The
right vas deferens measures 3.0 x 0.5 cm and the left measures 2.0 x 0.5 cm. A palpable lesion is
noted along the right posterior mid. The right anterior surface of the gland is inked green, the left
anterior surface is inked blue, and the posterior surface is inked black. The apical and bladder margins
are removed, and the remainder of the gland is serially sectioned from apex to base into five serial slices of 5 mm average thickness .The seminal vesicles /vas deferens bundles are attached to serial slice
5.Serial slices reveal a vague ,yellow area in the right posterior of slices 1, 2, 3 and 4, and another
vague ,yellow, irregular area in the left posterior of serial slices 2 and 3. Following further dissection
and submission of tissue for pathologic evaluation ,tissue is taken from slices 1 ,2, 3 and 4 for research
purposes .The entire gland is submitted as follows:

Prior Malignancy History
Dual/Synchronous Primary Noted"," Site: Prostate and seminal vesicles
Justification: The prostate gland and seminal vesicles were received in separate parts of the specimen, with a palpable lesion noted in the right posterior region of the prostate.

Laterality: Right and left
Justification: Involvement of capsule and extraprostatic extension were observed on both sides of the prostate gland.

Histology: Adenocarcinoma
Justification: The specimen was received from a patient with prostate cancer, and microscopic examination confirmed the presence of adenocarcinoma in the prostate gland and seminal vesicles.

Stage: pT3bNOMX
Justification: Based on the involvement of the capsule, extraprostatic extension, and seminal vesicles, the AJCC/UICC stage is pT3bNOMX.

Grade: Gleason score 9 (5+4)
Justification: The Gleason score was assigned based on the primary pattern of 5 and secondary pattern of 3 observed in the microscopic examination.

Behavior: Malignant
Justification: This is a malignant tumor, as evidenced by its aggressive growth, invasion into surrounding tissues, and positive surgical margins.",,,,
