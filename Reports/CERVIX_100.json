Gross\nexamination only. (M)\nCLINICAL INFORMATION: stage 1 B2 adenosquamous\ncarcinoma of the cervix.\nGROSS DESCRIPTION: Number of specimen containers: five, each labeled with\npatient name and MRN\nM.\nA.Container designation: \"uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries\"\n--Received unfixed is a radical hysterectomy specimen consisting of\nuterus, cervix, attached bilateral adnexa and parametrial tissue weighing\n260 gm, measuring 13.5 x 6.5 x 6.0 cm. The anterior serosa is smooth, the\nposterior serosa demonstrates a firm subserosal yellow-gray mass in the\nbody measuring 4.5 x 2.9 x 1.0 cm. Surfacing the serosa and the mass is a\n1.0 x 0.8 x 0.6 cm cystic structure occupied by clear watery fluid. The\nposterior serosa and soft tissue margins are inked. The ectocervix is\npink-tan with purpuric changes surrounding the os 1.0 cm (tumor?) and an\nanterior/posterior vaginal identified 1.0 and 0.8 cm in Length,\nrespectively. Sectioning of the anterior cervix at the os is grossly\nunremarkable, however, the tumor extends from within 0.9 cm of the\nanterior cervical os to the fundus and appears full thickness in the lower\nuterine segment and body. The posterior aspect is similar in appearance\nto that of the anterior aspect. Sectioning of the tumor demonstrates a\nyellow-gray purulent appearance with prominent necrosis. Representative\nsections of tumor and normal are submitted to\nn. The right ovary\nmeasures 2.2 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm and sectioning demonstrates a thickened cortex\nand pink-tan mottled stroma. The pink-tan fallopian tube with fimbriated\nend measures 5.5 cm in length, 0.6 cm in external diameter and sectioning\ndemonstrates a pink-tan mottled stroma. The left ovary measures 3.0 x 1.5\nx 1.0 cm and sectioning demonstrates a pink-tan mottled stroma. The\ncorresponding pink-tan fallopian tube with fimbriated end measures 6.0 cm\nin length, 0.5 cm in external diameter and sectioning demonstrates a\npinpoint lumen. Sections are submitted as follows: cassette Al-posterior\nbody, serosa with nodule extruding; cassette A2-representative\nanterior/posterior vaginal cuff (anterior inked red, posterior green); A3- anterior cervix and ectocervix full thickness; cassette A4-anterior\nendocervical canal full thickness; cassette A5-posterior cervix full\nthickness with ectocervix; cassette A6-posterior endocervical canal;\ncassette A7-anterior body; cassette\nA8-posterior body full thickness; cassette A9-anterior fundus full\nthickness; cassette A10-posterior fundus full thickness; cassette All-\nrepresentative right ovary and fallopian tube; cassette A12-representative\nleft ovary and fallopian tube; cassette A13-parametrial tissue right\nlateral wall; cassette A144-representative parametrial tissue left lateral\nwall.\nB.Container designation: \"Right pelvic lymph node\" - Received are\nmultiple portions of fat aggregating to 3.5 x 3 x 1.5 cm.

Dispersed throughout the villoglandular\nadenocarcinoma are areas showing complex cribriform architecture. These cribriform areas represent about 10-15%\nof lesional tissue . Although stromal invasion is not definitively identified, there is essentially no normal stroma present\nwithin the biopsy tissue to exclude an invasive component.

Justification: The report clearly states that the biopsy was performed on the cervix, which is part of the uterus.\n2. \"Laterality\": Not provided. Justification: The report does not mention any laterality as it's a biopsy, not a removal of the entire organ.\n3. \"Histology\": Adenocarcinoma, well-differentiated. Justification: The report explicitly states \"Histologic section of the cervical biopsy shows a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma.\"\n4. \"Stage\": Not provided. Justification: The report does not contain any information about the tumor size, lymph node involvement, or metastasis, which are required for TNM staging.\n5. \"Grade\": Low grade or well-differentiated. Justification: The report describes the adenocarcinoma as well-differentiated, which is a low-grade cancer.\n6. \"Behavior\": Malignant.

The uterus measures 13 x 6 x 4.5 cm, the cervix measures 4 x 3 cm, the vaginal\ncuff measures 1 cm anterior and 2.2 cm posterior. The resected surface is inked black. The endocervix measures 3.5\ncm and the endometrial cavity measures 4 x 2.5 cm. A large, tan-friable , circumferential mass is seen within the\nendocervix that measures 5 x 4.5 x 1 cm.

Only rare foci of lymphovascular invasion are noted. The maximum depth of tumor invasion in the cervix\nis 0.5 cm out of a cervical wall thickness of 1.2 cm. The tumor also extends into the lower uterine segment where the\nmaximum depth of tumor invasion, seen in the anterior half, measures 0.9 cm out of a total myometrial thickness of 1.2\ncm. Even though there is extension of tumor into the lower uterine segment, thg fact that the bulk of the tumor is within\nthe endocervix is consistent with a cervical rather than an endometrial origin.\nPhD\nHistory:\nThe patient is a year old woman with cervical cancer.

Where\nrelatively well preserved, the tumor invades as large nests of moderately pleomorphic cells with abundant mucinous\ncytoplasm and a high mitotic rate. This tumor is best classified as mucinous adenocarcinoma of endocervical type,\nalthough many of the cells have signet ring features and there are small foci of endometrioid differentiation as well.\nTumor is present on virtually every section from these large biopsies and is present at multiple inked and cauterized\nmargins. Detached fragments of adenocarcinoma are present in the endocervical canal biopsy.\nHistory\nThe patient is a year old woman with cervical cancer.\nPhysician CopyPh.D.\n.TL5-d-3Page 1 of 2\nID/l6/13 auKtiILAL P A 111ULU(.

The uterusmeasures about 8\ncm from the fundus to the ectocervix, 5 cm from cornu to cornu, and\na maximumof 5 cm from the anterior to the posterior surface.\nExternal examination of thespecimen is remarkable for a 2.5 x 1.0 cm\ntransmural defect with an irregular shaggy border involving the\nanterior endocervix. The margins of the tissues bordering the\ndefect are inked blue.The rest of the serosal surface of the\nuterus is tan-pink, intact, and relatively smooth. The paracervical\nsoft tissuesare focally involved by tumor. The margin of the\nof the vaginal cuff is painted with black ink. The cervix is\nvirtually replaced by an exophytic and endophytic tumor that focally\nprotrudes through the external os. The tumor is circumferential,\nabout 3.5 cm in diameter, and involves about a 3.5 cm long segment\nof tissue extending from the lower uterine segment into the wall\nof the upper vagina. The mucosal aspect of the tumor is amber-\ntan to reddish-tan and ulcerated. The endocervical canal shows\nsubtotal stenosiswith obstruction due to occupation by tumor.On\ncut sections, the tumor involves the entire wall of the cervix and\nhas a maximum thickness of about 2.0 cm. Invasion of the wall of\nthe anterior lower uterine segment by tumor is also nearly full\nthickness.Invasion of the wall of the posterior lower uterine\nsegment is less.The tumor invades the wall of the upper vagina.\nInvolvement of the vaginal wall is nearly full thickness. Tumor\nwithin the wall of the vagina extends very close to the vaginal cuff\nmargin, inferiorly.The overlying vaginal mucosa is tan-pink and\nappears grossly uninvolved by tumor. Little, grossly uninvolved\ntan, intact squamous epithelium is grossly evident in the cervix.\nAs stated above, the endocervix is virtually replaced by tumor. The\nendometrial cavity is about 4 cm in length and has a maximum width\nof about 2.5 cm. The endometrium lining the uterine corpus and\nfundus is tan, smooth and has a maximum thickness of about 0.1 cm.\nThe uterine wall measures about 2.2 cm in maximum thickness.

Central necrosis within the\nhttps:/ \u2022'.. -Clinical Document: I Page 2 of 3\nnests is prominent. The tumor cells have a high nuclear to\ncytoplasmic ratio with nuclei containing loose chromatin and\nsmall nucleoli. Mitotic figures are abundant.\nGROSS DESCRIPTION:\nThe specimen is received fresh in five containers bearing\nthe patient' s name and hospital number.\nPart #1, labeled \"uterus and cervix,\" consists of a 1128-gm\nuterus and cervix with no attached adnexa. The uterus\nmeasures 14.5 cm from cornu to cornu, 17 cm from cervical os\nto top of fundus, and 9 cm from anterior to posterior. A\nprobe extends into the cervical os 14.5. The cervix is\nround with a defect in the posterior 6 o'clock position.\nThe defect appears to be within a lesion that is 3.5 cm from\nlateral to lateral and is 2 cm from anterior to posterior\nand involves the entire posterior aspect of the cervix. The\ndefect appears as a chunk out of this lesion that is 1.5 cm\ndeep and 1.5 cm on its side. The cervix itself is 5 cm from\nlateral to lateral and 4 cm anterior to posterior. There is\n2 cm of attached vaginal wall that is attached from the 6\no'clock to the 9 o'clock position. On the anterior and left\nside there is approximately 1 cm of attached vaginal wall.\nThe serosa on the uterus is pink and unremarkable. The left\nparametrium is inked with black ink and the right\nparametrium is inked with green ink. Upon opening the\nuterus, the cervical canal measures 3.5 cm and the\nendometrial cavity is 10.5 cm vertically and 7 cm at its\nwidest point. The endometrial cavity is covered with a\nboggy, hemorrhagic-appearing endometrium. The myometrium is\nthick and boggy-appearing. The maximum thickness is 3.5 cm.\nThe cervix is dissected away from the specimen and entirely\nsubmitted as follows:\nAl-A6 12 o'clock to 3 o'clock\nA7-A13 3o'clock to 6 o'clock\nA14-A24 6o'clock to 9 o'clock\nA25-A30 9 o'clock to 12 o'clock\nA31-A36 right parametrium\nA37-A39 left parametrium\nA40-A47 uterus\nPart #2, labeled \"right pelvic lymph node,\" consists of two\nfragments of fibroadipose tissue.

Sections from the transition zone of the cervix\ndemonstrate previous biopsy site changes in addition to mu tfocal\nareas of squamous cell carcinoma in situ. These changes are also\nseen in most sections from the lower uterine segment and\nendometrium. Invasive squamous cell carcinoma erodes through the\ncervical stroma and is present at the paracervical soft tissue\nmargins of resection, as well as adjacent to the distal\n(paravaginal) margins of resection (considered positive margins. The\nmyometrium is diffusely involved by invasive squamous cell\ncarcinoma, with extension to the serosal surfaces. In the right\nfundic region, carcinoma invades into the serosal surfaces of the\nterminal ileum and appendix with extension through the muscularis\npropria and towards the mucosal surfaces. The right oophorectomy\nspecimen demonstrates invasive squamous cell carcinoma (similar to\nthat seen elsewhere), secondarily involving a pre-existing\ncystadenofibroma. The possibility of direct spread of the carcinoma\nfrom the uterus to the right ovary cannot be excluded (versus\nmetastatic spread or \"co-synchronous primary\". The tumor appears\nhigh grade with significant tumor-associated necrosis,\nangiolymphatic vascular space invasion and a high rate of mitotic\nactivity.\nHISTORY: Cervical carcinoma\nMICROSCOPIC:\nSee Diagnosis.\nGROSS:\n1: BLADDER FLAP\nLabeled \"bladder flap\" and received in formalin is a 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.3\ncm portion of pale tan-pink soft tissue.\nA.

The serosa is red-tan and diffusely roughened with\nhemorrhagic red-tan soft tissue adhesions. The segment of ileum and\na portion of the appendix are adhesed to the right fundic region of\nthe uterus with a large amount of hemorrhagic soft tissue adhesions\nand indurated adipose tissue. The anterior fundic region is also\ndiffusely nodular due to underlying tumor. The nodules range from.\n1.0 to 3.5 cm in greatest dimension and coalesce with one another. A\nsmall amount of parametrium is attached to the uterus and is\napproximately 2.0 cm in maximum width on the right and 1.5 cm in\nmaximum width on the left. The cervix is 3.4 x 2.8 cm in the area\nof the ectocervical region. The ectocervix is diffusely disrupted\nwith no normal cervical epithelium grossly identified. No vaginal\ncuff is grossly identified. The endocervical canal is 3.5 cm long,\nlined by velvety hyperemic mucosa. Cut section of the cervix\nreveals tan-pink, somewhat fibrotic stroma. The endometrial cavity\nis 4.2 cm long from fundus to upper endocervical canal with a\nmaximum width of 3.5 cm. The endometrium is entirely obliterated\nwith a somewhat papillated tan-pink diffusely hemorrhagic lesion\nwhich grossly extends to, and involves, the lower uterine segment.\nFocal areas of necrosis are present throughout the endometrial\nlesion. No normal endometrium is grossly identified. The uterine\nwall is 3.0 cm in maximum thickness. Cut section of the myometrium\nreveals a semi -firm pale tan appearance and is continuous with the\nendometrial tumor. The entire myometrium has a maximum thickness of\n3.0 cm and is involved by tumor. Diffuse necrosis is also present\nthroughout. The lesion grossly extends to and disrupts the serosa,\npredominantly along the posterior uterine wall. The tumor in the\nregion of the fundus also grossly invades the serosa of the segment\nof terminal ileum. The left fallopian tube is 5.5 cm long and 0.6\ncm in maximum diameter. No fimbria is grossly identified. A 1.0 x\n0.8 x 0.7 cm orange-tan nodule is present in the region of the\nfimbria. Cut section of the fallopian tube reveals a central patent\nlumen. The left ovary is red-tan, generally smooth and 2.5 x 1.5 x\n1.0 cm. Cut section of the left ovary reveals normal ovarian\nparenchyma with several white -tan scattered corpora albicantia\nidentified. No tumor is grossly identified. The segment of\nterminal ileum is 20 cm long with an average diameter of 2.5 cm.\nThe serosa of the terminal ileum is red-tan, diffusely granular with\nnumerous softtissue adhesions adhering it to the fundus of the\nuterus. Theattached mesenteric adipose tissue has a maximum width\nof 6.0 cm andis also adhesed to the posterior fundic region of the\nuterus. Thesegment of terminal ileum is opened along the\nantimesenteric border revealing pale tan, normally folded mucosa.\nCut section of the wall of the terminal ileum in the region of the\nadhesion to the fundus of the uterus reveals infiltrative tumor\nwhich grossly invades the muscularis of the terminal ileum, but does\nnot grossly invade the mucosa of the terminal ileum. The wailof\nthe terminal ileum is approximately 0.6 cm in maximum dimension.\nThe appendix is 7.0 cm long and 0.8 cm in maximum diameter. The\nattached mesoappendix has a maximum width of 1.5 cm and is diffusely\nhemorrhagic and indurated. The serosa of the appendix is red-tan\nand diffusely granular with multiple soft tissue adhesions along the\nproximal 2 cm adhering it to the fundic region of the uterus. Cut\nsection of the appendix reveals that the uterine tumor grossly\ninvolved the serosa of the appendix, but does not involve tte wall\n,fS of the appendix. A central patent 0.3 ;m maximum diameter lumen is\nidentified. The segment of cecum, including ileocecal valve, is 7.0\ncm long with a maximum diameter of 4.5 cm. The serosa of the cecum\nis red-tan with multiple red-tan hemorrhagic soft tissue adhesions.\nNo discrete areas of tumor nodules are grossly identified. The\nsegment of cecum is opened along the antimesenteric border revealing\nslightly hyperemic tan-red normally folded mucosa. The wall of the\ncecum is approximately 0.6 cm in maximum width.

The uterusmeasures 12.2 x 7.6 x 5.8 cm.\nThe cervix measures 6.2 cm long and up to 6.0 cm in diameter. The vaginal cuff along the anterior\naspect extends up to 1 .2 cm away from the cervix and along the posterior aspect extends up to 1.6 cm\naway from the cervix.. The endometrial cavity measures 3.5 cm wide and 5.7 cm long. The endometrium\nranges in thickness from 0.2 to 0.4 cm in maximum thickness. The myometrium ranges in thickness from\n1.0 to 2.8 cm in maximum thickness. The right paracervicat soft tissues extend up to 1.4 cm away from\nthe cervix and the left paracervical soft tissues extend up to 1 .6 cm away from the cervix.\nThe serosa is smooth ,glistening and red-tan. Within the cervix there is a large ,fungating ,pink-tan focally\nnecrotic mass with areas of hemorrhage present measuring 7.8 x 7.5 x 1.4 cm. The mass is fully\ncircumferential with possible involvement of the anterior and posterior lower uterine segments.The cut\nsurface of the mass reveals semiflrm pate tan tissue Intermixed mucous filled cyst that range from 0.3 to\n0.7 cm in greatest dimension .Also the mass also grossly invades greater than 50% of the cervical\nstroma and comes within 0 .2 cm of the inked serosa and 0 .7 cm of the vaginal cuff resection margin. The\nparacervical soft tissues appear grossly free of tumor .No additiona llesions are identified.\nThe remaining endometrium is focally granular with pinpoint areas of hemorrhage. The nyometrium\nconsists of soft to rubbery pink-tan tissue .Along the uterine fundus one subserosal Ieiomyoma is\nidentified measuring 0.5 cm in greatest dimension. No polyps are identified. The paracervical soft\ntissues are entirely submitted .A portion of the tumor from the 3:00 position of the cervix and normal\nendometrium from the .fun dus are released to the biorepository for possible future studies.\nRepresentative sections of remaining tissue are submitted .Gross photos are taken.\nInk key:\nBlue: Anterior\nBlack: Posterior\nSlide key:\nEl, E2.
