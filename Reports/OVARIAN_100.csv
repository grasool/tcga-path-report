Additional comments :This tumor demonstrates predominantly papillary serous architecture
consisting largely papillary and solid growth pattern with slit-like spaces. In addition, there are
areas with prominent malignant squamous component, which suggests endometrioid
differentiation. The tumor cells are highly pleomorphic with high mitotic activity with abnormal
mitotic figures. Areas of necrosis are present. Focally, individual tumor cells are seen to contain
intracytoplasmic mucin droplets, supported by the positive staining with PAS-D but this population
iswell below 10% of the tumor cells. The metastatic implants demonstrate destructive invasion
and widespread involvement of tissues in the pelvic and abdominal cavities.
Intraoperative Consult Diagnosis

2 of 7 SURGICAL PATHOLOG* WORKING DRAFT
Clinical History
The patient is a year-old woman who undergoes omentectomy and bilateral salpingo-
oophorectomy.
Gross Description
The specimen is received fresh, in eleven parts, each labeled with the patient's name and number.
Part A, received fresh and labeled ""omentum,"" consists of a large piece of fibro-fatty tissue
measuring 19.0 x
14.5 x 4.2 cm. The specimen appears to be diffusely involved by a tumorous mass. Serial
sectioning of the
tissue reveals grey firm homogeneous tissue which diffusely involves the fatty omentum. In
addition, there
are round nodular masses located sporadically through the omentum. A section is taken for frozen
section
analysis (FS1) with subsequent placement in cassette Al. Additional sections of tumor involving
omentum
are submitted in cassettes A2-A4.
Part B. received fresh, labeled ""bilateral ovaries and tubes, large ovary is left,"" consists of one
large complex
piece consisting of two ovaries, two fallopian tubes, and an abundant amount of complex
parametrial and
adnexal tissue. There is no uterus or cervix included in this specimen. The large cystic ovary is
designated
as left by the surgeon, and consists of a large cystic component measuring 7.5 x 6.5 x 5.9 cm in
association with a complex, firm, solid, tumorous mass. The entire specimen measures 11.5 x 6.1 x
3.8 cm.
The cystic portion is opened to reveal abundant yellow-green fluid which is drained. Associated
fallopian
tube measures 4.9 cm in length and 0.5 cm - 0.9 cm in varying diameter. The right-sided ovary
consists of
multiple nodular masses and cystic structures and measures 6.9 x 7.2 x 4.5 cm in aggregate. The
cysts
contain an abundant amount of serous, slightly yellow-tinged fluid. The solid areas consist of
multiple well
circumscribed, firm, tan-grey, fish-flesh-like masses. The right-sided fallopian tube measures 5.2
cm in
length and 0.4 cm - 0.9 cm in varying diameter, and appears unremarkable. Between the two
ovarian
masses there appears to be extraneous tissue consisting of nodular, firm, yellow-tan-grey, and
homogenous masses that number at least four. Both ovaries and associated structures are inked
black on
all surfaces. A portion of each ovary is designated for research purposes. Representative sections
of the
right ovary including solid and cystic masses are submitted in cassettes B1-B3. Cross- sections of
the
right fallopian tube are also submitted in cassette B3. Representative sections of firm, grey-yellow
nodular
areas are submitted in cassettes B4-B6; these represent the tumorous mass located in the midline
between
3 of 7 SURGICAL PATHOLOcs WORKING DRAFT
the two ovaries, involving parametrial and other ill-defined structures. The left ovary and large cyst
are
examined and thoroughly sectioned. The solid portion of the left-sided mass is tan-grey,
homogenous and
nodular in configuration. Representative sections of this left-sided mass are submitted in cassettes
B7-B9.
The large cystic structure has a wall thickness of 0.1 cm. Representative sections of this large
cystic

Gross Description 
The specimen is received in seven parts, labeled with the patient's name and medical record number. 
Parts 
A and B are received fresh. Parts C-F are received in formalin. 
Primary surgery 2 of 4 
 Part A, additionally labeled ""omentum,"" consists of a section of red-tan, fibrofatty and firm tissue 
measuring 
13.0 x 13.0 x 2.0 cm. The specimen is studded with multiple yellow-tan to yellow-white nodules 
ranging in 
size from 0.2 cm up to 2.5 cm in greatest dimension. A 1.0 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm portion of the specimen is 
taken for tumor banking, and representative sections are submitted in cassettes Al-A2. 
Part B, additionally labeled ""right ovary plus tube,"" consists of a partially cystic, partially solid structure 
with no identifiable ovary and attached fallopian tube, which measures 11.0 x 9.0 x 4.0 cm and weighs 
238.2 gm. The cystic portion measures 4.0 cm in greatest dimension and has a cyst wall that ranges 
between 0.1 and 0.2 cm in greatest dimension, and has two exophytic papillary-like structures on the 
external surface, which measure 2.0 and 0.8 cm in greatest dimension, respectively. Deep to these, the 
specimen is solid and has a fleshy, yellow-tan, irregular parenchyma. The solid portion measures 4.0 x 3.0 
x 2.0 cm. The attached fallopian tube measures 3.5 cm in length x 0.4 cm in average diameter, is smooth, 
pink-tan, and otherwise unremarkable. The external surface of the specimen is inked in black. A 
representative section of the solid portion is SUbmitted as frozen section 1 with the remnant in cassette B1. 
The remainder of the specimen is submitted as follows: 
Cassette B2: Representative sections of fallopian tube. 
Cassette B3: Representative sections of larger mass on exterior surface of cyst. 
Cassette B4: Representative sections of smaller exophytic mass on external surface of cyst. 
Cassettes B5-B6: Additional representative sections of cyst. 
Cassettes B7-Bl0: Representative sections of solid portion of cyst. 
Part C, labeled ""uterus, cervix, left ovary and tube and rectosigmoid colon,"" consists of a uterus, attached 
cervix, fallopian tube and attached soft tissue tumor mass, and attached short segment of sigmoid colon. 
The uterine specimen measures 7.5 cm from superior to inferior, 5.5 cm from cornu to cornu and 4.0 cm 
from anterior to posterior. The cervix measures 3.5 cm from side to side, 3.0 cm from anterior to posterior 
and approximately 2.0 cm in length. The serosal surface of the uterus is tan-brown, smooth and glistening, 
with areas of subserosal hemorrhage scattered throughout. The cervical mucosa is tan-white, smooth and 
glistening, again with small areas of punctate mucosal and submucosal hemorrhage. The specimen probes 
to 6.5 cm and is opened along the lateral surfaces. The endocervical mucosa is pale tan and measures 1.0 
mm in thickness. The endometrium is also pale tan, and free of polyps and masses. The endometrium 
measures 2.0 mm in thickness. The myometrium is serially sectioned, revealing no mural lesions. The 
myometrium averages 1.3 cm in thickness. Two nodular masses of tissue are attached to the left surface of 
the uterus. The serosal surfaces of both are similar, each with a very nodular contour, covered by a 
tan-brown serosa, and grossly obvious tumor nodules. Grossly, it is difficult to ascertain which of these 
two masses contains the ovary, however one does appear to be attached to the uterus by a tubular 
structure, likely the fallopian tube. This portion of tissue measures 7.5 x 4.5 x 4.0 cm and the adjacent 
tubular structure measures 2.5 cm in length, with an average diameter of 1.0 cm. Serial sections through 
the mass reveal no grossly obvious ovarian tissue, though a lumen filled with necrotic tissue is identified in 
the previously-described tubular structure. The adjacent mass of tissue has a similar gross appearance 
and measures 5.5 x 4.5 x 3.5 cm. One portion of the specimen contains a thin-walled cyst filled with 
translucent fluid, measuring 3.0 cm in greatest diameter. On cut section, the specimen is composed of 
multiple nodules of tan-white, firm tissue ranging in size between 0.5 and 2.0 cm. Adherent to the uterus 
and ovary is a segment of large bowel measuring 14.0 cm in length with an average diameter of 4.0 cm. 
The serosal surface is diffusely caked with tumor nodules ranging in size between 0.2 and 0.5 cm, though 
with confluence of tumor in other areas. What is thought to be the proximal margin is received stapled 
shut, with the distal margin remaining open. Upon opening, a scant, tan-brown mucoid material is 
identified. The mucosa is pale tan, and unremarkable. Sections are submitted as follows: 
Cassette C 1: Anterior cervix. 
Cassette C2: Posterior cervix. 
Cassette C3: Anterior endomyometrium. 
Cassette C4: Posterior endomyometrium. 
Cassettes C5-C6: Sections of putative ovary. 
Primary surgery 3 of 4  Cassette C7: Putative fallopian tube. 
Cassettes C8-C9: Mass adjacent to ovary. 
Cassette CIO: Proximal bowel margin. 
Cassette Cll: Distal bowel margin. 
Cassette C12: Sections through unremarkable bowel mucosa. 
Cassette C13: Representative sections of small bowel serosa. 
Part D, labeled"" rectum, staples proximal,"" consists of a single, short segment of rectum measuring 6.5 cm 
in length with an average diameter of 2.5 cm. Attached to the specimen is a large amount of very irregular 
and fragmented brown-tan, fibrous connective tissue measuring 8.5 cm in width x 4.0 x 2.5 cm. The 
surrounding soft tissue is inked prior to opening of the staple surface at the proximal margin. The 
specimen is opened to reveal pale tan-brown, glistening mucosa with no grossly identifiable masses or 
lesions. A section of the proximal margin is submitted in cassette D 1. A section of the distal margin is 
submitted in cassette D2. A random section is submitted in cassette D3. The attached fibrous connective 
tissue is serially sectioned, revealing a pericolonic mass of tan-white tumor measuring 3.0 x 2.5 x 2.0 cm. 
The tumor mass approaches the proximal margin of resection within 1.0-2.0 mm, and the lateral margin of 
resection within 3.0 mm. A representative section is submitted in cassette D4. 
Part E, labeled ""transverse colon tumor,"" consists of an irregular and fragmentary tan-brown, polypoid 
mass measuring 3.4 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm. The specimen is serially sectioned, and representative sections are 
submitted in cassette E1. 
Part F, labeled ""small bowel mesentery,"" consists of a single ovoid nodule of yellow-tan, soft tissue 
measuring 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm. The specimen is entirely submitted in cassette F1. 
Part G, labeled ""bladder peritoneum,"" consists of an irregular and fragmentary tan-brown, polypoid mass 
measuring 3.4 x 1.8 x 1.0 cm. The specimen is serially sectioned, and representative sections are

• .... J. I "," Site: The specimens are taken from various sites including hepatic flexure, cecum, small bowel, colon, ileum, mesentery, right lower quadrant, peritoneum, diaphragm, gallbladder, soft tissue, and anterior abdominal wall. Justification: The specimens are taken from different locations to investigate the presence and extent of tumors.

Laterality: Laterality is provided for some of the specimens, including right, left, and upper quadrant. Justification: Providing laterality helps locate the site of the biopsy or resection in the body.

Histology: The histology report indicates various types of tissues and growths, including adenocarcinoma, fibrofatty tissue, foreign-body giant-cell reaction, benign growth, and skeletal muscle. Justification: Knowing the type of tissue or growth helps determine the appropriate treatment.

Stage: The stage is not provided in this report. Justification: Staging requires information on the size of the tumor, lymph node involvement, and metastasis, which may not be available from these specimens.

Grade: The grade is not provided in this report. Justification: Grading requires assessing the differentiation of the tumor cells, which may require more extensive sampling than what was done here.

Behavior: The behavior refers to whether the growth is benign or malignant. In this report, some specimens are described as benign, while others show evidence of adenocarcinoma, a type of malignancy. Justification: Knowing the behavior of the growth helps determine the appropriate treatment and prognosis."

Clinical nt,,,,,,, 
The patient is a history of a pelvic mass, undergoing 
resection of 
abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. 
Gross Description 
The specimen is received in six parts, each labeled with the patient's name and 
medical record number. 
Parts A and C are received fresh, and Parts B, D-F are received in formalin. 
Part A is received fresh from the O.R., for frozen section, additionally labeled ""uterus, 
cervix, ovaries, 
Page 2 of 6 
rectum, and left ureter -FS,"" and consists of a composite resection specimen 
including: uterus (5.5 cm 
from superior to inferior, 5.0 cm cornu to cornu, and 3.5 cm anterior to posterior), 
cervix (1.Scm x 1.0cm), 
ovaries and fallopian tube, a segment of descending colon and rectum (23.0cm in 
length x 3.0cm diameter) 
and an unattached segment of ureter (S.Ocm in length x 0.3cm in diameter). 
Centered in the left adnexa is a 14.0 x 7.0 x 6.5 cm solid and cystic mass. The solid 
portion (8.5 x 6.6 x 4.0 
cm) is soft, pink-tan with areas of apparent necrosis, and comprises approximately 
40% of the mass. The 
cystic portion of the mass is composed of multiple smooth walled cystic spaces 
without excresences. No 
residual ovary is identified in the mass. The solid portion infiltrates through the distal 
portion of the 
rectum with invasion through the rectal wall, ulceration of the mucosa, and 
penetration into the lumen. 
The proximal and distal margins of the colon/rectum are free of tumor. Tumor 
approaches to wthin 3.Scm 
from the distal margin (rectum) and to within 10 cm of the proximal margin 
(descending colon). The tumor 
contains a cauterized surface near it's invasion into the rectum. The surgeon 
indicates the separate 
segment of left ureter was present adjacent to this cauterized area. Additionally, 
tumor infiltrates into the 
posterior wall of the uterus with invasion into but not through the myometrial wall. 
The uterine cavity 
overlying the area of tumor invasion appears grossly unremarkable. The tumor does 
not appear to involve 
any other structures grossly. Two lymph nodes are found between the ovarian mass 
and the rectum. 
Representative sections of the solid component of the mass and sections of tumor  infiltrating rectum are 
submitted for frozen section diagnosis #1 with the frozen remnants in cassettes Al­
A3. Additionally, 
portions of the mass as well as uninvolved endomyometrium are submitted for 
research. 
The uterus additionally shows multiple nodules, sub-mucosal and sub-serosal, with 
firm, white-tan cut 
surfaces showing a whorled appearance. These nodules range in size from 0.7 to 
2.2cm in maximal 
diameter and do not appear to be associated with the adnexal mass. No areas of 
hemorrhage, necrosis, or 
cystic degeneration are identified in these nodules. The ectocervix (1.0 x 1.0 cm) has 
a smooth white-tan 
surface without focal lesions. The cervical os is fish-mouthed and measures 0.7 cm in 
greatest dimension. 
The endocervix has glistening tan-brown mucosa and appears grossly unremarkable. 
The endometrium is 
thin, tan-brown, and grossly appears atrophic. The right ovary is white-tan, 
measures 2.5 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm 
and shows no gross abnormalities. The right fallopian tube (4.5 cm length x 0.5 cm 
diameter) appears 
grossly unremarkable. The anatomic area of the left fallopian tube appears to consist 
entirely of infiltrating 
tumor and no residual fallopian tube is identified grossly. The separate portion of left 
ureter is unoriented, 
appears intact, and shows no evidence of involvement by tumor.

Result of Her-2/neu test: This carcinoma is negative for Her-2/neu 
oncoprotein overexpression. 
An immunohistochemical assay was performed on block All using the CBll 
monoclonal antibody to 
Her-2/neu oncoprotein. The staining intensity of this carcinoma was 0 on a scale of 
0-3 with focal 
cytoplasmic staining only. 
Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of a or 1 are considered negative for 
overexpression of Her-2/neu 
oncoprotein. 
Those with a staining intensity score of 2 are considered borderline. We and others 
have observed that 
many carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 do not show gene amplification. 
All carcinomas with 
staining intensity scores of 2 are therefore submitted for FISH testing. The results of 
the FISH test are 
issued directly from the molecular cytogenetics laboratory. 
Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 3 are considered positive for 
overexpression of Her-2/neu 
oncoprotein. Tumors in this category show an excellent correlation between the 
results of

intensity scores of 2 do not show gene amplification. All carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 are 
therefore submitted for 
FISH testing. The results of the FISH test are issued directly from the molecular cytogenetics laboratory.

Gross Description 
The specimen is received in twelve parts, each labeled with the patient's name and 
medical record number. 
Part A, additionally labeled ""left ovary and tube,"" consists of a 250-gram, 12.5 x 9.5 
x 9.0 cm ovarian mass 
with no grossly identifiable normal ovarian tissue. The surface of the tumor is 
bosselated and contains 
grossly visible multiple nodules, some of which are cysts containing yellow-tan, 
serous fluid. Cross 
sectioning of the mass shows the majority of the tumor is composed of alternating 
solid and friable, 
papillary-appearing, tan-white areas with multinodular cut surface. There is a 4.0 x 
3.5 x 3.5 cm cyst 
which was previously opened, with a papillary and hemorrhagic interior surface. The 
tumor grossly does 
not invade the capsule. A 5.3 cm in length and 0.8 cm in diameter fallopian tube is 
present with 
intraluminal soft, friable material and no tumor involvement on the interior wall is 
noted. A portion of the 
tumor is submitted for frozen section as FS1, with the remnant submitted in cassette 
Al. Sections are 
submitted as follows: 
Cassette A2: Fallopian tube. 
Cassettes A3-A15: Representative sections of tumor. 
Part B, additionally labeled ""right ovary and tube,"" consists of a175 gram, 10.0 x 8.0 
x 5.5 cm ovarian  mass with no grossly identifiable normal ovarian tissue. The surface of the tumor is 
bosselated and shows 
multinodular masses. Cross sectioning of the ovary shows a tumor with solid and soft 
friable, 
multinodular, tan-white cut surface. A 3.8 x 2.8 x 2.5 cm, serous cyst on the surface 
is also present, with

ovary measures 3.5 x 
3.0 x 1.8 cm. The fallopian tube measures 7.0 cm in length and 1.0 cm in average 
diameter. The end of 
the fallopian tube has a papillary, white-brown mass protruding from it. The ovary 
has a papillary mass, 
measuring 3.0 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm, attached to the external surface and growing toward 
the fallopian tube. The 
external surface is otherwise unremarkable. The ovary and fallopian tube are 
bisected, demonstrating a 
firm nodule, measuring 1.5 cm, within the central aspect of the ovary. Additionally, 
there is a papillary, 
white-tan nodule, measuring 1.2 cm, within the tubal fimbria. No other lesions are 
noted. A portion of the 
papillary mass on the fimbria as well as from the surface of the ovary is submitted 
for frozen section 
diagnosis as FS1, with the frozen section remnant submitted in cassette A1. 
Representative sections of the 
remainder of the tissue is submitted as follows:

The patient is a with a 13-cm complex pelvic mass and 
history of left breast 
carcinoma, status post lumpectomy, lymph node dissection, and chemo-radiation. 
She undergoes total 
abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. 
Gross Description 
The specimen is received in twelve parts, each labeled with the patient's name and 
medical record number. 
Parts C-L are received in formalin. 
Part A, received fresh and additionally labeled ""right adnexa,"" consists of an ovary 
with attached fallopian 
tube that weigh 383.5 gm and measure 15.0 x 14.0 x 10.0 cm. The ovary capsule is 
intact with 
multiloculated cysts, and the external surface is smooth with no tumor or masses 
seen on the surface. 
Upon sectioning of the ovary, there are multiple papillary excrescences. There are no 
hemorrhagic or 
obvious necrotic areas. The cystic fluid is brown. The ovarian mass itself is ~13.0 
cm. There is no 
obviOUS grossly normal ovarian tissue present. The fallopian tube measures ~7.0 cm 
in length. It is 
difficult to assess the diameter given that there appears to be tumor involvement of 
the fallopian tube. In 
the most normal area of the fallopian tube, the diameter is ~0.7 cm. A frozen section 
is taken ofthe 
ovarian mass, with the remnant submitted in cassette A1.

and attached left ovary with tube, that weigh in total 125.5 gm. The uterus and 
cervix together measure 
8.0 cm from superior to inferior, 5.5 cm from medial to lateral, 3.0 cm from anterior 
to posterior. The left 
ovary measures 2.6 x 1.5 x 0.7 cm, while the fallopian tube measures 5.5 cm in 
length and 0.7 cm in 
diameter. The cervix itself measures 3.2 cm. The uterus is opened along its lateral 
border. There is no 
gross tumor identified. The endometrium is 0.3 em thick and the myometrium is 4.0

Gross Description 
The specimen is received in eleven parts, each labeled with the patient's name and 
medical record number. 
Parts A-E are received fresh. Parts F-K are received in formalin. 
Part A, labeled ""left tube and ovary frozen section,"" consists of a large cyst with no 
grossly identifiable ovary 
weighing 165 gm and measuring 7.5 x 6.5 x 5 cm, intact. The surface is smooth and 
is inked black. There 
is a fallopian tube (4 x 0.5 x 0.5 em) and the fimbral is attached to the mass by 
adhesions. The cyst 
contains 120 cc of watery brown fluid. The cyst is composed of a multiloculated, 
partially solid 
consistency. The deflated cyst measures 5 x 6.5 x 1.2 cm and weighs 24 gm. 
Approximately 25% of the 
cyst is solid, composed a soft, white-tan, solid component or a fibrous, brown, solid 
component. The rest 
of the cyst is multicystic with the cysts containing golden yellow, papillary 
outgrowths on the inner surface.

Part B, labeled ""right tube and ovary,"" consists of multiple soft, fragmented, irregular 
pieces of 
pink-red-purple tissue weighing 31.2 gm and measuring 7.7 x 5.6 x 2 cm in 
aggregate. The largest 
fragmented piece consists of multiple papillary outgrowths attached to a smooth 
lining suspended from the 
fallopian tube. The fallopian tube measures 4.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm and is hemorrhagic. 
Using the fallopian 
tube for orientation, the papillary areas are present on a fragment of cyst wall that 
corresponds to the 
inside surface of the cystic mass, although exact orientation is not possible. In 
addition to this, there are 
multiple, separate fragments measuring 3.5 x 3.5 x 1 cm in aggregate. On serial 
sectioning, these are 
composed of yellow and white adipose tissue with small areas of white-tan fibrinous 
exudate. A random

Part B is received fresh and is additionally labeled ""right pelvic L node polyp"" and 
consists of an ovoid 
mass that measures 4 x 3.5 x 2 cm. The mass also has attached yellow fat. A portion 
of the 
specimen was taken for Oncotech study. The surface of the specimen is inked black 
and it is serially 
sectioned to reveal a rubbery, tan, nodular parenchyma. Representative sections are 
submitted in 
cassettes Bl-B3. 
Part C, additionally labeled ""left peri-aortic lymph nodes,"" consists of a single 
irregularly shaped, soft 
to firm, yellow-tan fibrofatty tissue fragment measuring 5 x 1.3 x 0.8 cm. 
Examination of the 
specimen reveals four lymph node candidate, which are submitted as follows: 
Cassette Cl: One lymph node candidate, bisected. 
Cassette C2: Two lymph node candidates, bisected. 
Cassette C3: One small lymph node candidate, submitted intact.

irregularly shaped, 
yellow-tan to bright red, fibrofatty tissue fragment measuring 6.2 x 2.3 x 0.6 cm in 
greatest 
dimension. Careful examination of the specimen reveals three lymph node 
candidates, each of which 
are bisected, then individually submitted in cassettes 01-03. 
Part E, additionally labeled ""right ovarian vessel,"" consists of an elongate, irregularly 
shaped, red-tan 
to light yellow tissue fragment measuring 7 x 3.2 x 0.4 cm in greatest dimension. 
Careful 
examination reveals a single clamped small vessel, fibrous tissue, and four lymph 
node candidates.

sectioned at regular intervals, revealing no further discrete nodules, masses, or 
obvious lymph 
nodes. Additional sections are submitted in cassettes K3-K4. 
Part L, additionally labeled ""appendix,"" consists of a single soft, rubber, pink-tan, 
vermiform appendix 
measuring 5.1 cm in length x 0.5 cm in average diameter. The resection margin has 
been stapled 
shut using small silver-gray laparoscopic staples. A mesoappendix measures 5.5 x 2 
cm in greatest 
dimension and is soft, without lesion or mass. The mesoappendix is removed from 
the main portion 
of the specimen and is serially sectioned to reveal soft, yellow-tan, uniform fibrofatty 
tissue 
throughout, without lesion or mass. The mesoappendix is returned to the container. 
The resection 
margin of the appendix is inked black. The specimen is then sectioned and cross­
sectioned to reveal 
a single, pink-tan, lined lumen measuring 0.3 cm in average diameter. The 
appendiceal wall 
averages 0.1 cm in diameter. No obvious fecal matter or masses fill the lumen of the 
specimen. The 
bisected tip is removed to reveal no abnormalities or lesions. The remainder of the

NOTES: 
This high-grade adenocarcinoma appears to be of ovarian origin with widespread peritoneal implants. 
The carcinoma shows a predominantly serous papillary pattern, but a large amount of the tumor 
burden displays a solid glandular pattern. Numerous psammoma bodies are present. 
Focal Iymphovascular invasion is seen. 
Although no peritoneal wash specimen was obtained, peritoneal washings are presumed to be 
positive due to the large amount of tumor present in the peritoneal cavity as well as tumor invasion 
present in the fallopian tube.

Gross Description 
The specimen is received in multiple parts labeled with the patient's name and ID number. Parts A 
through E are received fresh and parts F through H are received in formalin. 
Parts A, additionally labeled ""omentum"" consists of a large mass of soft, irregularly-shaped, 
red-white-yellow tissue measuring 15.0 x 12.0 x 6.0 cm in greatest dimension. This tissue mass 
appears to comprise of some omental fat which is studded with multiple nodules of varying sizes. 
The nodules appear to be confluent in some areas. The nodules range in size from 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm 
to 6.0 x 5.0 x 3.0 cm. These multiple nodules appear to have various consistencies. One of the large 
nodules is tan-white and firm; a section of this large firm nodule is submitted for frozen section. 
FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS #1 
Omentum, biopsy: tissue consistent with metastatic carcinoma of ovarian origin, with features of 
Page 2 of 4 
papillary serous carcinoma. 
The remainder of this frozen section specimen is subm entirely in cassette A1. 
In addition to this large firm nodule (6.0 x 5.0 x 3.0 cm, frozen section obtained from middle of 
nodule), there are additional nodules which are slightly softer in consistency. Also present are some 
thin, fluid-filled cysts. These nodules are scattered throughout the omentum and are at the edges of 
the resected specimen. Serial sectioning of all nodules reveal that most nodules are of the firm-white 
variety with a few nodules being extremely soft and almost papillated on cut appearance. The thin, 
luid-filled areas when cut reveal cystic spaces filled with some clear serous fluid as well as some 
papillary regions. Additional representative sections are submitted as follows: 
Cassette A2 Cystic portion of tumor with cyst wall and 
papillary excrescences extruding into cyst wall 
Cassette A3 Additional section of fibrous large nodule 
Cassette A4 Representative section of soft papillary portion 
of tumor 
Cassette AS Additional representative section of one of the 
firm nodules 
Part B, additionally labeled ""pelvic mass left"" consists of multiple fragments of extremely soft, 
irregularly-shaped, tan-white tissue measuring approximately 6.0 x 7.0 x 2.0 cm in aggregate. A 
small piece of this tissue is submitted for frozen section diagnosis. 
FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS #2 
Left biopsy: neoplasm, favor malignant, final diagnosis deferred. 
The remainder of the frozen section tissue is submitted entirely in cassette B1. An additional 
representative section is submitted in cassette B2. 
Part C, additionally labeled ""right ovary and tube"" consists of a large mass of soft, irregularly-shaped 
bosselated tissue measuring 7.0 x 7.0 x 3.5 cm In greatest dimension. Protruding along one edge of 
this mass of tissue appears to be a fallopian tube which is slightly dilated in portions, especially more 
distal. The fimbriated ends of the this fallopian tube are slightly blunted. A small, white, firm 
structure, possibly representing an ovary is noted on the surface of this mass and measures 
approximately 2.0 x 1.0 x 0.8 cm. This mass is bisected to reveal an ovary which has been largely 
replaced by this large soft, bosselated lesion. The remaining ovarian tissue appears to be grossly 
unremarkable. This papillary process involves the entire ovary, however, no definite ovarian source 
f origin is grossly identified. The fallopian tubes are then serially sectioned to reveal grossly 
unremarkable fallopian tubes in the proximal portion and a dilated fallopian tube in the distal portion 
 with what appears to be tumor in the lumen. Representative sections are submitted as follows: 
'::assette Cl Fallopian tube (normal and with tumor) 
Cassette C2 Ovary with relation to papillary growth 
Cassette C3 Additional section of grossly unremarkable 
ovary adjacent to papillary growth 
Part D, additionally labeled ""left pelvic mass"" consists of multiple fragments of soft, 
irregularly-shaped, tan-white papillated tissue measuring 10.0 x 5.5 x 5.0 cm in aggregate. No 
identifiable organ is found within this tissue mass. Portions of the mass appears to be slightly more 
solid while other portions are more papillary. Representative sections of the more solid portions are 
submitted in cassette Dl and representative sections of the more papillary area are submitted in 
cassette D2. 
Part E, additionally labeled ""pelvic tumor"" consists of multiple fragments of friable, 
irregularly-shaped, soft tan-yellow tissue measuring 15.0 x 11.0 x 6.0 cm in aggregate. The tissue 
appears to consist of multiple nodules of friable solid to papillary tissue ranging in size from 0.5 x 0.3 
Page 3 of 4 
x 0.1 cm to 9.0 x 5.0 x 2.0 cm. These large nodules are sectioned to reveal some predominantly 
solid areas while other areas demonstrate a more papillary appearance. On the exterior surface of 
one of the nodules, there appears to be a firm white-yellow fibrous portion of unknown significant. 
Representative section of this firm white-yellow area next to tumor is submitted in cassette El and 
an additional representative section of tumor is submitted in cassette E2. 
Part F, additionally labeled ""sigmoid tumor"" consists of three friable pieces of red-tan, soft, 
irregularly-shaped tissue measuring 2.0 x 0.8 x 2.0 cm in aggregate. One of the pieces appears to be 
some fibrous tissue while the other two pieces are more polypoid in appearance. The two polypoid 
pieces are bisected and the specimen is submitted entirely in cassette Flo 
Part G, additionally labeled ""uterus, cervix"" consists of an uterus with attached cervix and without 
adnexa weighing 47 grams. The uterus measures 7.3 cm from fundus to cervix, 4.1 cm from cornu to 
;ornu, 2.9 cm from anterior to posterior, and is oriented by the peritoneal reflexion. The serosa is 
smooth and is not distorted. The uterine cavity sounds to 6.3 cm. The cervix measures 2.5 cm in 
lenght and 3.0 cm in width. The external os is fish mouth-shaped and measures 1.3 cm in width. 
The uterus is opened along the lateral borders. The ectocervix and endocervical canal are 
unremarkable. The endometrium is tan, measures 0.1 cm in thickness, and contains no polyps. The 
myometrium measures 1.2 cm and contains no leiomyomas. On the posterior surface of the cervical 
uterine junction, there is a small firm nodule measuring 1.2 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm. This nodule is sectioned 
to reveal a firm homogenous interior. The main substance of the uterus and cervix appear to be 
grossly uninvolved by tumor; however, more parametrial tissue is present on the left than right. The 
left parametrial tissue appears to be grossly involved by tumor. Representative sections are 
submitted as follows: 
Cassette Gl Firm nodule at external posterior cervical 
uterine junction (in entirety) 
Cassette G2 Anterior cervix 
Cassette G3 Posterior cervix 
Cassette G4 Anterior endomyometrium 
Cassette G5 Posterior endomyometrium 
Cassette G6 Left parametrium 
Cassette G7 Right parametrium 
Part H, additionally labeled ""sigmoid serosa tumor"" consists of multiple fragments of extremely 
friable, irregulary-shaped, soft, tan-white tissue measuring 10.0 x 8.0 x 2.0 cm in aggregate. The 
tissue is sectioned to reveal some portions of solid consistency while others are more papillary and 
friable. Representative sections of the more solid portions are submitted in cassette Hl and 
• I.·· ••• 1& II' A • apillary portions are submitted in cassette H2.  "," Site: The samples are taken from various locations including the ovary, fallopian tube, left pelvic mass, pelvic tumor, sigmoid tumor, sigmoid serosa, uterus, and cervix.

COMMENT:
Ovarian Tumor Synoptic Comment
Type of tumor :The tumor is predominantly serous carcinoma; however, extensive areas of solid growth
are present and areas of endometrioid and clear cell patterns are noted. Additionally a focal 1.1 cm

Grade of tumor: III.
Site of tumor :Bilateral.
Location of tumor :Intraovarian.
Condition of capsule :Indeterminate (the capsule of both ovaries arrived ruptured; it is not clear if the
capsule was transected in the OR or if the capsule was ruptured).
Cut surface :Solid and cystic.

'Comment :Immunoperoxidase stains were performed on the sarcomatous element. This focus stains
strongly for vimentin and shows only focal staining for keratin. This staining pattern supports an
interpretation of sarcoma rather than sarcomatoid carcinoma, thus a small (1.1 cm) sarcomatoid focus is
present (carcinosarcoma). Given the small size of this focus, it will likely have little effect on the overall
prognosis.has reviewed this slide (A5) in the immunohistochemical results and concurs with
this interpretation.

Gross Description
Part A is received fresh and labeled ""left ovary"" and consists of a 14.0 x 12.0 x 5.5 cm lobulated, tan-
white,
purple solid and cystic mass with generally smooth external surface, but rare surface nodules which are
white-tan-yellow and focally confluent, up to 2.5 cm in aggregate, covering approximately 5% of the
external
surface. A 9.5 cm irregular rupture or incision exposes soft, lobulated tan-red interior, focally cystic but
generally solid. Additionally, there is an attached 7.5 x 1.0 cm diameter fallopian tube with fimbria which
is
grossly unremarkable. Although the mass has been previously ruptured, an attempt is made to ink the
surface. The cut surface reveals a proliferation with friable papillary areas, light tan necrotic areas, myxoid
and yellow degenerate areas, multiple cystic cavities and occasional hemorrhagic foci. Tissue was removed
for research. Sections:

Additional comments: We favor this to be a primary serous carcinoma of the left ovary with peritoneal 
spread to the right adnexa, and intracavitary spread to the endometrial polyp and superior cervix. The 
possibility of a primary uterine carcinoma with to the ovary seems unlikely given the extensive 
involvement of the left ovary with synchronous primary serous carcinomas cannot be 
excluded yet also seems less likely. has reviewed the slides and concurs.

rPC't()I-nV, omentectomy, biopsy of colonic implant and appendectomy. 
Gross Description 
The specimen is received in seven parts, each labeled with the patient's name and unit number. 
Part A, labeled ""left ovary"", consists of a grossly distorted ovary weighing 243 grams and measuring 10 x 
7 
x 9 cm. There are multiple papillated masses on the surface. A portion of fallopian tube is identified which 
measures 6 cm in length and 1 cm in greatest diameter. Serial sectioning reveals that the nearly the 
entire 
ovarian mass consists of tan-pink, soft, friable, papillary structure. Cassette Ai contains a frozen section 
remnant. Representative sections of the mass are submitted in cassettes A2-A6. 
Part B, labeled ""right ovary"", consists of an ovary with a portion of fallopian tube weighing 83. 5 grams 
and 
measuring 7 x 6 x 4.8 cm. The fallopian tube measures 7 cm in length and 2 cm in greatest diameter at 
the 
portion of hydrosalpinx. A large cyst is associated with the ovary measuring 6.5 cm in greatest diameter 
and containing clear serous flUid. The external surfaces are inked in black. The internal surface of the cyst 
cavity is smooth. A 1.3 cm nodular area beneath the cyst wall is visible in the region of the adherence of 
the 
fimbriae to the ovary. Sections through this region reveals a mass which is contiguous with the internal 
surface of the fallopian tube obstructing the distal orifice. This mass measures 1.7 cm in greatest 
diameter. 
A section of this area is submitted in cassette B1. Two irregularly-shaped white fibrous-appearing areas

Behavior: Malignant
Justification: The pathology report describes a papillary serous carcinoma in the left ovary with peritoneal spread and positive cytology, as well as an endometrial polyp with adenocarcinoma. The extensive involvement of the left ovary suggests a primary serous carcinoma arising from that site, with secondary spread to the right adnexa, endometrium, and peritoneum. The colonic implant and appendix also show malignant changes, indicating further dissemination of the cancer. However, the specific stage cannot be determined without additional information on the extent of the disease."

negative staining in adjacent areas. 
Result of Her-2/neu test: This ovarian carcinoma is negative for Her-2/neu oncoprotein 
overexpression. 
An immunohistochemical assay was performed on block B3 using the CBll monoclonal antibody to 
Her-2/neu oncoprotein. The staining of was 0 on a scale of 0-3 with cytoplasmic 
staining only (Her-2 test interpreted by 
Page 2 of 7 
Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 0 or 1 are considered negative for overexpression of Her-
2/neu 
oncoprotein. 
Those with a staining intenSity score of 2 are considered borderline. We and others have observed that 
many carcinomas with staining intenSity scores of 2 do not show gene amplification. All carcinomas with 
staining intenSity scores of 2 are therefore submitted for FISH testing. The results of the FISH test are 
issued directly from the molecular cytogenetics laboratory. 
Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 3 are considered positive for overexpression of Her-2/neu 
oncoprotein. Tumors in this category show an excellent correlation between the results of 
immunohistochemical and FISH testing, and almost always show gene amplification.  Intraoperative Consult Diagnosis

Diagnosis based on gross and microscopic examinations. Final diagnosis made by 
attending "," Site: The specimens are from various sites in the abdomen and pelvis, including mesenteric mass, omentum, diaphragm nodule, periaortic lymph nodes (right and left), pelvic lymph nodes (right and left), mesenteric lymph node, bowel rings, and abdominal wall nodule.

Laterality: The specimens include right and left-sided lymph nodes and a diaphragm nodule. Other specimens do not have laterality information provided.

Histology: The histological interpretation requires microscopic examination, which is not provided in the description. Therefore, it cannot be determined from this information.

Stage: Staging of any pathological condition is based on multiple factors including microscopic examination, and sometimes clinical correlation. Hence, stage is not provided.

Grade: Grade refers to the degree of differentiation of cancer cells, which again requires microscopic examination. Thus, grade is not provided.

Behavior: The behavior of a lesion or condition can only be determined after histological diagnosis, which isn't available in this description. Therefore, behavior cannot be commented upon.

In summary, due to the lack of microscopic examination results, specific histology, stage, grade, and behavior cannot be determined based on this gross description alone."

The patient is a G3 Pi, with a 17 x 11 em complex pelvic mass, carcinomatosis, and 
an increased CA-125 level (443). The patient undergoes exploratory laparotomy, total abdominal 
hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy, appendectomy, tumor debulking and 
rectosigmoid resection with a primary anastomosis. 
Gross Description 
The specimen is received fresh in thirteen parts, each labeled with the patient's name and medical record 
number. 
Part A is additionally labeled ""omentum."" It consists of a single fragment of omentum, measuring 22 x 18 
x 
3 cm. The omentum is studded with multiple white-pink nodules, ranging in size from 0.2 cm to 5.0 cm. A 
representative section is submitted for frozen section diagnosis as FS1, with the frozen section remnant 
submitted in cassette A1. An additional representative section is submitted in cassette A2. 
Part B is additionally labeled ""uterus, cervix, ovaries and tubes plus tumor."" It consists of a single 
hysterectomy specimen weighing 800 grams and measuring 14 cmfrom fundus to cervix, 4.5 cm from 
cornu to cornu and 9.0 cm from anterior to posterior. The cervical portion of the specimen measures 3 cm 
in length and 2 cm in diameter. The uterus is distorted by multiple firm, white-tan, whorled leiomyomata 
ranging in size from 0.3-5.5 cm in average diameter. No necrosis or hemorrhage is identified in any of the 
leiomyomata. The endometrium is tan-pink and measures 0.2 cm in average thickness. The myometrium 
is distorted by the multiple leiomyomata and therefore ranges in thickness from 1.0-2.7 cm in thickness. 
The uterus is oriented by the peritoneal reflections. Within the left adnexa, there is a 2.5 x 1.5 x 1.3-cm 
firm, white nodule which may represent ovarian tissue. There is an additional firm, white-yellow, solid 
region measuring 2.5 x 1. 7 x 1.0 cm which may represent tumor within the adnexa. A small segment of 
fallopian tube is identified measuring approximately 3 cm in length and 0.8 cm in average diameter. There 
are additional small, white, firm nodules which apparently represent tumor studding the adnexal tissue. 
These nodules obscure the normal anatomy and make orientation difficult. The right adnexa contains a 
firm, white region measuring 3.0 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm which may represent ovarian tissue. A portion of fallopian 
tube measuring approximately 4 cm in length and 0.7 cm in average diameter is present. Again, multiple 
firm, white regions, possibly representing tumor are present within the adnexa precluding exact 
identification of the normal anatomy. A representative section of the specimen is submitted for frozen 
section analysis as frozen section #2, with the remnant submitted in cassette B1. Within the specimen 
container, there are multiple unoriented fragments of firm, white-tan tissue representing tumor measuring 
13.5 x 13 x 4 cm in aggregate. Representative sections of the remainder of the specimen are submitted as 
follows: 
r-assette B2: Anterior cervix. 
assette B3: Posterior cervix. 
Cassette B4: Anterior endomyometrium.  \~h'ri(lr endomyometrium. 
Cassette B6-B7: Representative sections of leiomyomata. 
Cassettes B8-B10: Representative sections of left adnexa. 
Cassettes B11-B13: Representative sections of right adnexa. 
Cassette B14: Representative sections of loose tumor fragments. 
Part C is additionally labeled ""rectosigmoid colon."" It consists of a single segment of colon, measuring 7.1 
cm in length and 2.0 cm in average diameter. Adherent to the serosal surface is mesenteric fat, 
measuring 
10.5 x 9.0 x 3.0 cm, which is studded with abundant firm, white nodules, ranging in size from 0.2 cm to 
2.5 cm. The largest of these nodules abuts the radial surface of the colon. However, it does not appear to 
invade the muscular wall nor the mucosa. The pericolonic fat is extensively studded with tumor, and 
therefore, an adequate lymph node dissection cannot be performed. The specimen was received with 
staple 
lines at each colonic resection margin. One end is inked in blue and the opposite inked in black for 
microscopic evaluation (no orientation was provided). A representative section of tumor is taken for 
Oncotech analysis. Representative sections are submitted as follows: 
Cassettes Cl-C2: Resection margins (perpendicular). 
Cassettes C3-C5: Tumor in approach to colonic wall. 
Cassette C6: Additional representative section of pericolonic fat.

measuring 4 x 3 x 2 cm and a yellow-brown, fibroadipose tissue fragment measuring 3 x 1.5 x 1 cm, 
which 
is attached to the white-tan component. Representative sections are submitted in cassette H1. 
Part I, additionally labeled ""appendix,"" consists of a 4 cm in length x 0.6 cm in average diameter appendix 
with attached yellow-brown mesoappendix. The serosal surface of the appendix is brown and glistening. 
At the tip of the appendix, a white-brown, cirrhotic lesion is present, measuring 1.8 x 1.2 x 1 cm, 
involving 
the tip of the appendix. The tip of the appendix, including the transition into the white, cirrhotic lesion, is 
submitted in cassettes 11-12. Representative cross-sections of the appendix and mesoappendix are 
submitted in cassette 13. 
Part J, additionally labeled ""small bowel mesenteric,"" consists of multiple, unoriented, white-tan tissue 
fragments measuring 1 x 1 x 0.5 cm in aggregate. The specimen is wrapped in tissue paper and entirely

COMMENT: 
The tumor shows complex papillary architecture with a multilayered syncytial-appearing epithelium 
with abundant budding, The tumor cells are pleomorphic with relatively abundant eosinophilic 
cytoplasm, a very high N:C ratio, and coarse vesicular chromatin with prominent eosinophilic 
nucleoli. Abundant mitotic figures and apoptotic cells are seen, The findings are most likely those of 
a high-grade serous carcinoma, and the large cell size with eosinophilic cytoplasm suggests the 
oxyphilic variant thereof. However, the differential diagnosis can include oxyphilic variants of clear 
cell carcinoma or a high-grade endometrioid adenocarCinoma. The absence of extra-ovarian tumor 
given the size of the primary is also rather unusual for serous carcinoma. Serous carcinoma is 
nonetheless favored as the overall growth pattern is most consistent with this diagnosis, and areas 
with well-developed features of either clear cell or endometrioid adenocarcinoma are not seen. 
Additional stains were necessary to properly assess this case, and these were performed and 
evaluated with the following results: 
-WTl: Positive. 
-p53: Positive, variable intensity. 
-ER: Negative. 
-PR: Focal, patchy positive, 
-CA125: Positive. 
The expression of WTl is most consistent with an ovarian serous carcinoma, which is also supported 
by the diffuse expression of p53 and CA125, and low-level or absent expression of PR and ER 
respectively. Although p53 staining is diffuse, the intenSity varies more than is typical of serous 
carcinoma. Nonetheless, the diagnosis is not excluded by this pattern. In contrast, expression of 
• 'ITl and diffuse p53 argues against clear cell carcinoma, and while some PAS-positive material is 
:esent, this is diastase-resistant and therefore not compatible with glycogen. At least some of the 
material is mucin and stains with mucicarmine. The expression of WTl and poor expression of ER  and PR also argue against endometrioid adenocarcinoma.

The specimen is received in eight parts, each labeled with the patient's name and medical record 
number. Parts A and B are received fresh. Parts C through H are received in formalin. 
Part A is additionally labeled ""left ovary and tube."" It consists of a single unoriented, intact, red 
salpingo-oophorectomy specimen, weighing a total of 908 gm and measuring 16.8 x 11.5 x 9.5 cm, 
including an attached fallopian tube, measuring 7.5 x 1.2 x 1 cm. The external surface of the ovary 
and tube is predominantly smooth, except for a vague, ill-defined, approximately 3 cm area on the 
ovarian surface which is slightly irregular in texture. This area is inked in blue, and the remaining 
surface is inked in black. Although irregular, no overt papillary excrescences are seen. In addition, 
the fallopian tube resection margin is inked in green. The fallopian tube appears unremarkable, and 
no discrete lesions are seen or palpated, and the fimbriae are lush. The ovary is sectioned to reveal 
a soft, fleshy, gray-white, almost-solid interior with an irregular, up-to-6 cm apparently necrotic 
cavity in the middle. The tumor is soft and has a grossly discernible papillary appearance. There is  also a single smooth-walled, 4 cm, unilocular cyst filled with a clear, yellow-brown fluid as well as an 
adjacent 2.4 cm, unilocular, hemorrhagic cyst. This latter cyst directly underlies the blue-inked area 
and contains multiple small papillary excrescences along the wall as well as a 1.5 cm, solid area with 
a consistency similar to the rest of the bulk tumor. The fallopian tube is sectioned and appears 
grossly unremarkable. A representative section of the tumor is submitted for frozen section diagnosis 
as FS1, with the frozen section remnant submitted in cassette A1. In addition, approximately 150 gm 
of the tumor is submitted for tissue banking. Additional representative sections are submitted as 
follows: 
Cassette A2: Fallopian tube plus tumor. 
Cassette A3: Additional sections of tube and fimbriae. 
Cassette A4: Representative sections of blue-inked area.

Part B is additionally labeled ""left pelvic node."" It consists of a single unoriented fragment of pink 
soft tissue, measuring 5 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm. A representative section is submitted for frozen section 
diagnosis as FS2 and a touch prep, with the frozen section remnant submitted in cassette B1. 
Palpation through the remaining tissue reveals five additional candidate lymph nodes, ranging in size 
from 0.2 cm to 0.5 cm. The entire remainder of the specimen is submitted in cassette B2. 
Part C is additionally labeled ""left pelvic node."" It consists of multiple fragments of yellow-tan and 
soft tissue, measuring 3.5 x 3 x 2 cm in aggregate. Multiple lymph node candidates are identified 
within the fatty, lobular tissue. Sections are submitted as follows:

Part A, labeled ""left adnexa,"" consists of an ovary with attached fallopian tube weighing 327.5 grams. 
The ovary is replaced by a mass and measures 15 x 10.5 x 5.5 cm, and the fallopian tube measures 
10 cm in length x 0.5 cm in diameter. Gross photographs are taken. The external surface of the 
ovary is noted to be smooth, tan-white-gray and shiny. No surface adheSions, solid tumor or 
papillary growth, or implants are noted. The tumor capsule is intact. Upon sectioning, the cut 
surface of this nodule appears to be yellow-orange. Sectioning of the tumor reveals 70% solid 
growth with 30% cystic area. The cystic area is multiloculated and contains yellow serous fluid. The 
solid portion of the ovary is yellow, lobulated, firm, with punctate areas of hemorrhage. The cystic 
rea is also noted to contain some areas of hemorrhage. The interior of the cyst is noted to contain 
papillary excrescences. A portion of the specimen is submitted for frozen section diagnosis 1, with 
the remnant submitted in cassette A14. The attached fallopian tube and fimbriae appear grossly 
 unremarkable. However, a small, white-tan nodule measuring 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm is visible on the 
surface of the mesosalpinx. An additional nodule measuring 0.4 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm is palpable within the 
mesosalpinx. Representative sections are submitted as follows:

Part 8, labeled ""right adnexa,"" consists of an ovary with attached fallopian tube weighing 296 grams. 
The ovary is replaced by a mass and measures 12 x 9.5 x 6.5 cm. The tube measures 9 cm in length 
x 0.5 cm in diameter. A portion of the specimen is sent for Oncotech, and sample tissue is taken for 
ovarian tumor banking. The surface of the ovary is noted to be tan-white-gray and smooth, without 
adhesions, solid tumor, papillary growth or implants. The tumor capsule appears to be intact. 
Sectioning of the ovary reveals an 80% solid, 20% cystic mass. The solid areas are tan-white-yellow 
and firm/rubbery, and also contain soft and papillary areas. Small areas of hemorrhage are noted in 
the solid areas. No obvious areas of necrosis are noted. The cystic areas within the tumor contain 
papillary excrescences and a yellow serous fluid. The cystic area is noted to be unilocular. The 
fimbriae are grossly unremarkable. However, approximately 2.2 cm from the fimbriae, a hard nodule 
is palpable within the fallopian tube, measuring 1 x 0.8 x 0.7 cm. Representative sections are

1 I 1"," Site: The primary tumor site is not explicitly mentioned in the report, but based on the description of high-grade serous carcinoma involving various anatomical structures, it can be inferred that the most likely primary site is the ovary or fallopian tube.

Laterality: The laterality is not consistently provided for all specimens, but when mentioned, there are metastatic lesions on both sides of the body.

Histology: High-grade serous carcinoma is the predominant histological type observed in this report. This type of cancer is commonly associated with ovarian and fallopian tube tumors.

Stage: The extent of the disease suggests a late-stage presentation, as there are metastatic lesions found in various anatomical locations, including lymph nodes, soft tissues, and abdominal organs. However, a formal staging classification is not provided in this report.

Grade: The grade of the tumor is consistently reported as high grade, indicating aggressive behavior and poor differentiation.

Behavior: The behavior of the tumor is malignant, with metastatic lesions found in multiple anatomical locations."

The different sources of the tissues allow for a comprehensive examination of the patient's condition.

Laterality: The tissue samples are from both sides of the body, including the right and left tube and ovary, indicating the spread of the disease in the pelvic region.

Histology: The histological diagnosis includes serous adenocarcinoma, stromal hyperplasia, leiomyoma, benign paratubal cysts, and metastatic carcinoma. These different types of tumors suggest a complex medical condition requiring various treatments.

Stage: The stage of the disease is not provided in the diagnosis, making it difficult to determine the extent of the cancer and the appropriate treatment plan.

Grade: The grade of the serous adenocarcinoma is III, indicating a high-grade malignancy with a poor prognosis.

Behavior: The behavior of the tumors is malignant, meaning they are capable of invading surrounding tissues and metastasizing to other parts of the body, which is consistent with the diagnosis of metastatic carcinoma in multiple sites."

SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT
P14530(3"," Site: Peritoneum, vagina, right pelvis, left pelvis, anterior abdominal wall, lesser omentum, retroperitoneum - These are the different sites from where the biopsies were taken.

Laterality: Not provided - The report does not mention any laterality as the samples were taken from various sites in the abdomen and pelvis.

Histology: Atypical cells (negative for cytokeratin and CK16) - This suggests that there are some atypical cells present in the samples, but they do not express cytokeratin or CK16, which could indicate a specific type of tumor. However, no definite carcinoma was seen.

Stage: Not provided - The report does not mention any staging information as it is not applicable to biopsy results.

Grade: Not provided - The report does not mention any grading information as it is not applicable to biopsy results.

Behavior: Not definitively benign or malignant - While no definite carcinoma was seen, the presence of atypical cells raises some concern. Further studies and clinical correlation are necessary for a definitive assessment."

COMMENT: Both ovaries are enlarged and subtotally replaced by
carcinoma .By convention, the neoplasm is considered to be a
bilateral primary ovarian neoplasm; however ,the involvement of the
mucosa of both fallopian tubes by carcinoma (in addition to the outer
aspects of the fallopian tubes which are involved tumor), the
possibility of synchronous primary tubal neoplasms are also
considered .The carcinoma consists of multiple components ,including
serous carcinoma ,carcinoma with transitional or pseudotransitional
features, endonetrioid carcinoma ,anaplastic carcinoma, and a small
subpopulation of tumor cells exhibiting cytoplasmic clearing .Tumor-
associated necrosis is present in both ovaries ,as well as in
multiple other metastatic sites. Secondary acute and chronic
inflammatory changes are present in both ovaries and many of the
metastatic sites .Lymphovascular invasion by carcinoma is present in
most of the involved sites .Adhesions and secondary reactive
mesothelial change are noted in many of the involved sites. The
preliminary pathologic findings were communicated to on

personally examined the specimen, interpreted the
results, reviewed this amended report and signed it

DateFinalled:"," Site: Various including sigmoid mesenteric tumor, rectal tumor, right pelvic tumor, cul-de-sac peritoneum, right side wall tumor, left pelvic lymph node, peritoneal biopsy, right obturator lymph node, appendix, small bowel tumor, right diaphragmatic tumor, liver surface, falciform ligament, right hemidiaphragm, and left peritoneal tumor. The report describes gross examination of various specimens from different sites in the patient's body.

Laterality: Right (right pelvic tumor, right diaphragmatic tumor, right hemidiaphragm), Left (left peritoneal tumor), Bilateral (bilateral adnexae), and not provided for most other sites. The laterality is mentioned in the site description.

Histology: Not all specimens are described in terms of histology, but high-grade adenocarcinoma is mentioned in one specimen. Adenocarcinoma is a type of cancer that starts in glandular cells and can be high or low grade depending on how abnormal the cells look under a microscope.

Stage: Not provided in the report. Staging of cancer requires information about the size of the tumor, whether it has spread to nearby lymph nodes, and whether it has metastasized to distant organs, which is not available in this gross examination report.

Grade: High grade is mentioned in one specimen. The grade of a tumor refers to how abnormal the cells look under a microscope and can help predict how likely the cancer is to grow and spread.

Behavior: Not provided in the report. Behavior refers to whether the tumor is malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous). In this report, most specimens are described as tumors, which suggests that they are likely to be malignant, but confirmation of malignancy requires microscopic examination and other diagnostic tests.

In summary, the gross examination report provides information on the site, laterality, histology (in part), grade (in part), and behavior (not provided) of various specimens from different parts of the patient's body. However, more detailed information is needed to determine the stage and confirm the behavior of the tumors."

CCrT: The right ovary is massively involved and is nearly totally,
replaced by adenocarcincoa. Tumor in the right ovary appears to be
primary at that site. The left ovarian neoplasm probably represents
a second (synchronous) primary neoplasm. Carcinoma in all of
the involved sites exhibits predominantly serous features, albeit
with focal 'undifferentiated'/anaplastic components and pseudo-
transitional appearance in some areas. In a few of the involved
sites, the tumor exhibits hobnail and/or clear cell features. The
carcinoma exhibits papillary, glandular and solid patterns of
growth. Tumor-associated psanacma bodies are prominent in most of
the involved sites. Tumor necrosis, secondary acute and chronic
inflammnratory changes, fibrosing stramal reaction to tumor, and
adhesions are noted in many of the involved sites. Lymphovascular
invasion by carcinoma is present virtually in most of the involved

Behavior: Invasive and aggressive tumor growth, based on the description of the tumor size, location, and involvement of multiple organs.

The justification for the choice is based on the description of the tumor as a high-grade mullerian carcinoma, which is an invasive and aggressive type of cancer. The tumor involves multiple organs, including the spleen, liver, diaphragm, right gutter, transverse colon, mesentery, and small bowel mesentery, indicating a widespread and advanced stage of disease. The size and number of tumor nodules suggest an aggressive behavior, which is further supported by the observation of capsular infiltration and hemorrhage."

COMMENT: In both adnexa, the bulk of the tumor is iuvolves the ligamentous soft tissues aud 
there is a huge volume of tumor iu the omeutum; therefore, a peritoneal primary carcinoma is 
cousidered in the differential diagnosis. However, since there is also invasive tumor measuring 
more than 1 cm in the left ovary, by convention, this would be considered ~ primary ovarian 
neoplasm. Pathologic MX. Preliminary pathologic 
findings were conveyed Immunohistochemical stains, 
performed subsequently, Results of the 
immunostains are listed below.

"," Site: The specimens are taken from various sites including the appendix, omentum, small bowel lymph node, small bowel mesentery, periureteral areas, and bladder peritoneum.
Justification: The site is explicitly mentioned for each of the submitted specimens.

Laterality: The laterality is specified for some of the specimens, with tumors found in both the right and left periureteral regions.
Justification: The laterality is provided when applicable, and not provided when it's not relevant to the specimen (e.g., appendix, omentum).

Histology: The histology of the tumor is not explicitly provided in the description, with two frozen section suggestions being undifferentiated malignant carcinoma or granulosa cell tumor.
Justification: No definitive histological diagnosis is given in the description, and it's up to pathologists to determine based on microscopic examination.

Stage: The stage of the tumors is not provided as it requires clinical correlation and assessment of the extent of the disease.
Justification: Staging information is not available in the gross description.

Grade: The grade or differentiation of the tumor is not explicitly mentioned in the given description.
Justification: No grade information is provided, and it's typically determined based on architectural and cytological features observed via microscopic examination.

Behavior: Based on the description, the tumors are behaving as malignant neoplasms with local invasion (e.g., omental adhesions, periureteral implants).
Justification: The behavior is inferred from the gross findings of local invasion and the fact that it's an undifferentiated malignant tumor."

with bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries. The uterus measures 5.6 
em from fundus to ectocervix, 3 em from cornu to cornu, and 2.5 em 
from anterior to posterior. The anterior serosal surface is tan with 
multiple fibrous adhesions. On the posterior serosal surface of 
the uterus is a 4 x 3 x 1.5 cm tan nodular mass with a tan, firm cut 
surface. The ectocervix measures 3.5 x 3 em and is lined by tan, 
smooth epithelium. The cervical os is patent and measures 0.7 x 0.4 
cm. The uterus is opened anteriorly. The endocervical canal 
measures 2.2 em and is lined by tan-white rugose epithelium. The 
endometrial cavity measures 3 x 1.5 cm and is lined by tan-red 
velvety epithelium ranging up to less than 0.1 cm. Present in the 
posterior lower uterine segment is a 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm soft, tan 
polypoid tissue. The myometrium measures up to 1.5 em and is tan­
white and fibrous. The left ovary is completely replaced by a tan, 
firm, irregular, solid mass measuring 9 x 7 x 3 cm. The external 
surface of the mass is tan/ white, firm/ irregular with scattered 
areas of congestion. The firm mass encroaches the isthmic portion 
of the fallopian tube and also the fimbriated end. Cut section 
through the mass reveals variegated soft, tan to firm yellow surface 
with scattered areas of congestion. No residual normal ovarian 
tissue is identified. The mass seems to extend to the posterior 
wall of the uterus. The attached fallopian tube measures 8 ern in 
length. The fimbriated end is obscured by the tan, firm mass. The 
mass encroaches on the isthmic portion of the fallopian tube. 
Cut section of the fallopian tube reveals a central stellate lumen 
surrounded by wall thickness ranging up to 0.2 cm. The right 
fallopian tube measures 6.5 em in length t.'1ith an identifiable 
fimbriated end. The serosal surface is pink-tan/ smooth and

features with solid grmo.lth predominating and papillary and glandular 
growth noted focally. Some of the tumor cells appear anaplastic/ 
""undifferentiated"". There is a minor component of clear cell 
carcinoma seen in some, but not alit of the involved sites. 
Lymphovascular space invasion by tumor is present in many of the 
involved sites. As stated abovel it appears that the uterus

GROSS: 
1: RIGHT OVARY 
Labeled Ilright ovary"", received fresh in the Operating Room and 
subsequently fixed in formalin, is a 17 x 14 X 11 cm solid and cystic 
ovarian neoplasm. The cystic portion contains approximately 1000 cc 
of dark gray-red bloody fluid. There is an additional 10 x 5 x 4 cm 
cystic locule containing approximately 600 cc of clear straw-
colored fluid. This neoplasm is approximately 30% solid and 70% 
cystic in composition. A portion of the solid area is submitted for 
clonogenic assay. The external surface of the ovary wrinkled, tan 
and white l'lith multiple diffuse foci of tumor studding. The cystic 
area's inner cyst lining is smooth and tan-white to bosselated with 
abundant vasculature and no papillary excrescences. The wall 
thickness measures up to 0.1 cm. Upon sectioning I the ""solidll areas 
of tumor, they appear to be composed of both firm solid tan-white 
tumor and softer, friable papillary tan tumor. No residual unin­
volved ovarian parenchyma is identified. Adherent to the cystic 
portion of the ovarYI there is a 11.2 cm long, fimbriated 
fallopian tube with a diameter ranging from about 0.5 to 0.8 cm. 
The serosal aspect of the tube shows a 1.5 cm tan tumor papillary 
and solid tumor nodule at its fimbriated end. The rest of the 
serosal surface of the fallopian tube is red-tan and relatively 
smooth. On section, there is a pinpoint patent lumen. 
Representative sections are SUbmitted.

5: UTERUS, CERVIX, LEFT OVARY 
Labeled lIuterus, cervix, left ovary"" and received in formalin is a 
150 gram total hysterectomy of uterus Hith attached left adnexa. 
The uterus measures 6.5 em from cornu to cornu, 5.3 em anterior to 
posterior, and 7.5 em fundus to ectocervix. Multiple implants of 
tan granular tumor are adherent to the uterine serosa, primarily in 
the upper anterior and posterior corpus and fundus. There is also a 
4.2 x 3.5 x 3.0 em aggregate of tumor involving the right 
peri adnexal/parametrial tissue. The cervix measures 2.5 em in 
length and 2.0 em in diameter. The ectocervix has a surface area of 
2.2 x 2.0 em and surrounds a slit-shaped 0.2 cm in diameter patent 
os. The ectocervix is lined by a smooth pale tan mucosa. The 
endocervical canal is 2.0 cm in length with a maximum width of 0.3 
cm. The endocervix is lined by tan rugose mucosa and contains 
multiple nabothian cysts. The uterine cavity is 4.2 cm in length 
\>lith a maximum \>lidth of 1.0 em. The uterine cavity is distorted by 
the presence of a submucosal leiomyoma measuring 4.5 x 3.2 x 3.0 em. 
The leiomyoma is well-circumscribed and has a firm whorled bulging 
cut surface with no areas of hemorrhage, necrosis or cystic 
degeneration present. The endometrium is tan-red and ranges from 
less than 0.1 to about 0.3 cm in thickness. The endometrium is 
focally papillated and friable consistent with involvement by 
tumor. In some areas, the endometrium is not recognizable, perhaps 
due to replacement of the uterus by invasive tumor from the adnexa. 
The myometrium is attenuated the area involved by the submucosal 
leiomyoma and focally in areas involved by invasive tumor. The right 
uterine viall is soft and necrotic and appears to be involved by 
tumor invading in from the right periadnexal/parametrial tissue. 
The left ovary measures 4.5 x 3.2 x 2.5 em and has a smooth tan­
yellow external surface with small adherent areas of tumor measuring 
up to 2.2 x 1.5 x 0.3 cm. The cut surface of the ovary is pale tan­
yelloH. The fallopian tube measures 5.5 ern in length and 0.5 em in 
diameter and is adherent to the ovary and uterus by dense aggregates 
of tumor measuring 3.5 x 3.0 x 2.0 em involving the mesosalpinx. 
The surrounding tumor does not appear to invade the fallopian tube 
grossly. The fallopian tube has a patent 0.1 cm lumen which appears 
free of tumor. Representative sections are submitted.

COMMENT: The left fallopian tube was not enlarged. Most of the 
grossly evident tumor in the left adnexa appeared to be paratubal, 
rather than intratubal. Although this high-grade papillary serous 
carcinoma extensively involves the left para tubal soft tissues/ 
/ligaments, serosal surface of the left fallopian tube, focally 
involves the muscular wall of the left fallopian tube and is present 
within the lumen and focally involves the mucosa of the fimbriated 
end of the left fallopian tube, a peritoneal primary carcinoma 
rather than a primary tubal carcinoma is favored. The tumor 
exhibits features of high-grade serous carcinoma, for the most 
part, and focallY pseudotransitional features. Growth patterns 
of tumor include papillary, glandular and solid. Tumor-associated 
psammoma bodies are present in many of the involved sites. Lympho­
vascular invasion by tumor is present in most of the involved 
sites. Foci of tumor necrosis are present. Secondary acute and 
chronic inflammatory changes, reactive stromal changes, fibrosis, 
adhesions, and secondary reactive mesothelial proliferation are 
present in'most of the involved sites. No metastatic tumor is 
identified in the sampled lymph nodes. The lymph nodes do sho,""} 
reactive lymphoid proliferation, sinus histiocytosis, foci of 
fibrosis and/or calcifications.

Labeled ·uterus and tubesn, received fresh in the Operating Room and 
subsequently fixed in formalin, is a uterus with bilateral ovaries 
and fallopian tubes. The specimen weighs 90 grams. The uterine 
corpus is symmetric, measuring 8 em superior to inferior, 5 em eornu 
to cornu, and 3 em anterior to posterior. The serosa is pink-tan 
with adhesions and a few tiny to small granular to nodular deposits 
of firm tan tumor. The cervix has a length of 3 cm and a diameter 
of 2.5 em. There is a 0.4 cm slit-shaped patent os. The ecto­
cervical mucosa is tan and smooth. The transformation zone is 
distinct. The endocervical canal is about 2 cm long and lined by 
tan rugose mucosa. Cut sections of the cervix reveal several mucus­
filled cysts, up to 0.2 cm in diameter. The endometrial cavity is 
4.5 em in length and 2.5 cm in width and is mostly lined by soft red­
tan endometrium with an average thickness of 0.1 ern. Two semisoft 
endometrial polyps are present. One is located in the fundus 
about 1 em in maximum dimension and the other is present Page 3 of5  diameter. The muscular uterine wall has a maximum thickness of 
about 1.5 cm. There is a 1 x 0.9 x 0.9 em well-circumscribed 
subserosal leiomyoma with a firm white focally whorled cut surface 
without hemorrhage or necrosis in the posterior corpus. The right 
ovary is 2.2 x 1.1 x 0.4 em and has a firm tan-yellow cerebriform 
external surface with a few adhesions and a 0.2 em diameter red­
tan granular surface lesion. Cut surfaces of the right ovary 
reveal a narrow rim of yellow-tan cortical stroma, a few firm white 
corpora albicantia, a few minute cystic spaces, and no grossly 
evident invasive tumor. The right tube is 5.5 em in length and 
0.5 em in diameter. The fimbriated area is identified. There are 
multiple small white firm nodules ranging from 0.1 to 0.3 em on the 
serosal surface of the right fallopian tube and involving the 
para tubal soft tissues. A fe\\7 tiny right paratubal cysts are also 
noted. The lumen of the right fallopian tube is patent and the 
wall is grossly unremarkable. The left ovary is 2.2 x 1.1 x 0.4 cm 
and has a firm yellow-tan cerebriform external surface with a 0.2 
em firm nodular surface lesion suspicious for tumor. Cut surfaces 
of the left ovary are remarkable for a narrow rim of yellow-tan 
cortical stroma, several firm white corpora albicantia and a 0.8 em 
thin-1i'lalled, clear fluid-filled cyst lined by smooth tan tissue. 
There is no gross evidence of invasive tumor in the left ovary. 
The left tube is 5.5 cm in length and 0.5 em in diameter. The 
fimbriated area is identified. There are a 3.5 x-2.2 x 2 em white­
tan mass and 1 x 0.7 x 0.7 em white-tan firm mass in the para tubal 
tissues. There are also multiple tiny to small firm nodular aggre­
gates of apparent tumor ranging from about 0.1 to 0.8 cm involving 
the serosal surface of the left fallopian tube and fimbriated end 
of the tube. The lumen of the left fallopian tube is patent, for 
the most part, but partially occupied by tumor at the fimbriated 
end.

Tumor: Tumor occupies large portions of both ovaries and the omentum 
as well as large portions of almost all of the tumor containing 
sections submitted from the other sites. Tumor also extensively 
involves the lower uterine segment serosa without apparent invasion 
into the myometrium. In these sections the tumor growth pattern is 
predomiI}Qn.tlY~~~QL~.g with cyst.ic and papillary areas present in 
several sections and a minor~-cornpon·ent of gland forming tumor also 
represented. Tumor nuclei are large and nucleolated, mitoses are 
frequent, and in some areas there are bizarre tumor giant cells 
(e.g. H,I). Tumor necrosis (focally with calCification) is noted and 
there is also tumor- associated desmoplasia, hemorrhage, and 
inflanunation. Spleen is not present in tissue submitted as ""splenic tumorll
•  Uterus: The myoma is sharply circumscribed and shows the usual 
spindle pattern with some hyalinization. There is no evidence of 
significant nuclear atypia, increased mitotic activity, hemorrhage, 
necrosis, or calcification. No atypical features are seen in 
sections of the endometrium or the endometrial polyp. There is 
ciliated/ tubal metaplasia in some endometrial glands and in the 
lower uterine segment. Focal recent hemorrhagel hemosiderin, and 
associated histiocytes are noted in the region of the endocervical 
polyp and in the superficial cervical stroma (P,Q) (previous 
instrumentation?). Mucus filled cystic glands are also present in 
the cervix. Page 20f4

"," Site: Ovary, fallopian tube, uterus
Laterality: Not provided in the given description
Histology: High-grade serous carcinoma with tumor nodules and cysts in the ovary, broad ligament, and fallopian tube; leiomyoma in the uterus
Stage: Not assigned in the given description
Grade: High grade for the serous carcinoma
Behavior: Malignant, as it is a high-grade serous carcinoma

Justification: The description of the ovarian mass with a largest cyst measuring 1.6 cm and showing minimal blood clot adherent to its lining, along with a firm nodule arising from the cyst lining, suggests high-grade serous carcinoma. The broad ligament's multiple tan-white to tan-grey tumor nodules further support this diagnosis. In the uterus, the presence of a soft endocervical polyp and a subserosal myoma do not interfere with the high-grade serous carcinoma diagnosis in the fallopian tube and ovary. The carcinoma involves the lower uterine segment serosa posteriorly, confirming the uterine involvement of the high-grade serous carcinoma."

This high-grade primary ovarian (bilateral ovarian) serous carcinoma 
exhibits predominantly solid growth (with a HundifferentiatedH-like 
appearance), and also exhibits papillary growth and focal glandular 
growth. Both fallopian tubes exhibit secondary involvement by 
serous carcinoma. In addition, the left fallopian tube shows and 
area of intraepithelial/intramucosal carcinoma, which may be primary 
to that site. Intraluminal aggregates of serous carcinoma are also 
present in the left fallopian tube. There is extensive lympho­
vascular space invasion by carcinoma in all involved sites, 
including the uterus and cervix. Within the uterus, the endometrial 
mucosal involvement by serous carcinoma is predominantly within 
lymphatic spaces. There are, however, a few small foci of mucosal 
involvement extrinsic to lymphatics. While the latter might 
represent primary uterine papillary serous carcinoma, the alternate 
possibility that the endometrial deposits of tumor within the 
incorporated in the final diagnosis.

Labeled with the patient's name, labeled ""right tube and ovary, left tube and ovary, and uterus"", received 
fresh in the Operating Room and subsequently fixed in formalin is a 116 gram total hysterectomy and 
bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy specimen. The adnexa are separate from the uterus. No instructions for 
orientation are provided. The uterus is about 6.2 x 4.5 x 4.0 cm in greatest overall dimensions. The 
cervical portion of the uterus is about 2.0 cm long and up to 3.5 cm in diameter. The endometrial cavity is 
about 3.0 cm long and up to 1.5 cm in width. The endometrial mucosa has a maximum thickness of 0.1 
cm. The muscular uterine wall has a maximum thickness of about 1.5 cm. Attached to the cervix there is 
a cuff of vaginal tissue lined by tan mucosa that is up to 2.0 cm in length posteriorly, and up to O.S cm in 
length, anteriorly. The laterality of the adnexal structures Is uncertain. The larger of the two ovaries is 
4.S x 2.S x 2.4 cm. The ipsilateral fallopian tube has fimbria at one end, is about S.O cm in length and up 
to 0.5 cm in diameter. The adjacent adnexal soft tissues measure up to about 3.0 cm in width. The 
smaller ovary is about 2.0 x 1.S x 1.2 cm. The second fimbriated fallopian tube is 4.5 cm long and ranges 
from about 0.3 to 0.6 cm in diameter. 
There are multiple semi-soft to firm tan tumor nodules involving the serosal surface of the smaller ovary 
and focally invading the cortex of the smaller ovary. These tumor deposits measure up to O.S cm in 
diameter. There are also plaque-like and nodular aggregates of semi-soft to firm tan tumor involving tile 
adnexal soft tissues, bilaterally and the serosal surfaces of both fallopian tubes. There are friable tan 
tumor deposits amounting in aggregate to about 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm involving the parauterine soft tissues. 
No gross tumor is seen in the uterus, including the cervical portion of the uterus, or vaginal cuff. 
The larger ovary appears to be subtotally replaced by a moslly cystic and focally solid tumor that is about 
4.S cm in maximum dimension. The cystic neoplasm in the larger ovary is multiloculated and contains 
yellow fluid. The linings are tan-white and smooth, for the most part. There is some tan-white fibrous 
tissue in the cyst wall. The smaller ovary also shows multiple tiny to small cysts, ranging from less than 
0.1 to about O.B cm in diameter. There appears to be some concentration of cysls with some intervening 
white fibrous tissue over an area measuring about 1.0 em in diameter in the smaller ovary. Adhesions 
involving the adnexal structures and focally involving the serosa of the uterus are also noted. No gross 
pathologic lesions of the endometrium or myometrium are seen. The cervix shows extensive mucosal 
ulceration with focal associated necrosis. No gross pathologic lesions of the vaginal cuff are seen.

uncertain whether tumor involving the left ovary represents a synchronous primary 
neoplasm or a metastasis. In light of the finding of serous intraepithelial carcinoma in 
the left fallopian tube, the possibility of a second primary tubal neoplasm is considered 
to be likely. [If this does represent a second primary neoplasm, the tumor stage for the 
tubal neoplasm would be assigned as follows: pTis, NX.] Lymphovascular invasion by

10.0 cm. The adjacent fallopian tube has fimbriated at one end, is about 7.0 cm long and ranges from 0.5 
to 1.0 cm in diameter. 
The ovary is nearly totally replaced by a cystic and solid tan-white neoplasm. Maximum tumor dimension 
is close to 13.0 cm. The cystic component of the neoplasm accounts for about 75-80% of the total 
volume and is multiloculated. The cystic loculations range from about 0.5 to 10.0 cm diameter. Some of 
the cystic loculations contain blood-tinged yellow amber fluid. Most of the cystic loculations are lined by 
smooth tan tissue and one is partially lined by soft friable tan tumor over an area measuring about 1 .5 cm 
in diameter. The solid component of the tumor which accounts for about 15-25% of the total volume is 
white-yellow and firm. There are also multiple (about 10 or 12) nodular and plaque-like tumor 
excrescences on the serosal surface of the ovary involving an area measuring up to about 5.0 cm in 
diameter. The ovarian capsule is not ruptured. There are similar appearing nodular and plaque-like 
aggregates of tumor involving the paraovarian and paratuballigamentous soft tissues. The fimbriated 
end of the fallopian tube also shows about 1.0 cm diameter deposit of semi-soft to firm tan-white tumor,

intraoperative frozen consultation and subsequently fixed in formalin is 300 gram, 11.0 x 10.0 x 6.0 cm 
ovary with adhered fimbriated fallopian tube measuring 6.5 cm in length and 0.4 cm in with. 
The external surface of the ovary is light tan-yellow, and fibrotic. There is a focal area of excrescences 
identified measuring 0.4 cm in greatest dimension. Sectioning of the ovary reveals the ovary is 
approximately 99% replaced by a poorly circumscribed hemorrhagic. tan-white, necrotic, mainly solid and 
focally papilliferous tumor measuring 11.0 x 10.0 x 5.8 cm. The papillary appearing area constitutes 
10%ofthe tumor. No cystic formation is grossly noted. No residual ovarian parenchyma can be grossly 
identified. 
The serosa of the fallopian tube is dusky purple-red, congested and contains multiple minute paratubal 
cysts containing clear serous fluid. Cut section reveals no gross tumor and a stellate lumen measuring up 
to 0.1 cm in diameter.

Metastatic serous carcinoma (see comment) 
No colonic tissue identified 
COMMENT: 80th ovaries are atrophic and each shows extensive (mostly) serosal 
surface involvement by serous carcinoma. In both ovaries, there are small nodular 
aggregates of tumor within ovarian parenchyma. In the right ovary the maximum 
dimension of invasive tumor in the ovary is about 0.8 cm; thereby, qualifying by currently 
established criteria as a right ovarian primary neoplasm. Tumor in all involved sites 
exhibits features of high-grade serous carcinoma. Lymphovascular invasion by 
carcinoma is present in most of the involved sites. Tumor-associated necrosis, fibrosing 
stromal reaction to tumor, acute and chronic inflammatory changes, adhesions, and 
secondary reactive mesothelial proliferation are also noted in vicinity of tumor in many of 
the involved sites. The focus of high-grade epithelial dysplasia/serous intraepithelial 
carcinoma involving the fimbriated end of the left fallopian tube may represent a •

Labeled with the patient's name, labeled 'uterus"", and received fresh in the Operating Room for 
intraoperative gross consultation and subsequently fixed in formalin, is about a 260 gram intact total 
hysterectomy specimen. The uterus is about 11.0 x 7.5 x 7.5 cm in greatest overall dimensions. The 
cervical portion of the uterus is about 4.0 cm long and up to 4.0 cm In diameter with a 0.4 cm diameter 
external os. Attached to the cervix there is a circumferential cuff of vaginal mucosa that is up to 0.5 cm in 
length and up to 4.0 cm in diameter. The endometrial cavity is about 5.5 cm long and up to 2.5 cm in 
width. The flat endometrial mucosa ranges from about 0.1 to 0.15 cm in thickness. The muscular uterine 
wall ranges from 1.5 to 4.0 cm in thickness. 
The uterine serosa shows multiple plaque-like aggregates of semisoft to firm tan and tan-white tumor. No 
grossly evident metastatic tumor is seen in the wall of the uterus, or in the cervix or vaginal cuff. 
The uterus is distorted in shape due to the presence of multiple (about 15 to 20) well-circumscribed 
leiomyomas. The leiomyoma range from about 0.3 to 3.5 cm in diameter and are intramural. Each 
leiomyoma Is composed of firm white whorled tissue without grossly evident areas of hemorrhage or 
necrosis. There is a 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm soft tan endometrial polyp. The endometrium is otherwise grossly 
unremarkable. The muscular uterine wall shows trabeculations and minute to tiny cystic spaces 
suggestive of adenomyosis. The cervix is remarkable only for multiple mucus-filled cysts ranging from 
about 0.2 to 0.7 cm in maximum dimension.

B. LEFT TUBE AND OVARY 
Labeled with the patient's name, labeled ""left tube and ovary"", and received fresh in the Operating Room 
for intraoperative frozen section and subsequently fixed in formalin is about a 53.7 gram salpingo­
oophorectomy specimen. The ovary was incised at the time of intraoperative consultation and now in the 
partially collapsed state is about 6.0 x 5.5 x 4.0 cm. The fimbriated fallopian tube is about 5.0 cm long, 
ranges from 0.5 to 0.7 cm in diameter and has a maximum luminal diameter of 0.2 cm. 
The ovary is virtually replaced by a cystic and solid neoplasm that is about 6.0 cm in maximum 
dimension. The cystic component of the neoplasm accounts for about 40% of the tumor volume and is 
multiloculated. The cystic loculations range from about 0.2 to 3.5 cm in maximum dimension and contain 
clear yellow fiuid. Some of cystic loculations are lined by a smooth tan tissue and some are lined by 
papillated tan tissue. The solid component of the neoplasm is composed of firm, white-yellow tissue. 
The capsule of the ovary is intact, but the similar-appearing tumor also involves the serosal surface of the 
ovary. The ligamentous adnexal soft tissue adjacent to the ovary and fallopian tube show nodular and 
plaque-like aggregates of semifirm tan tumor ranging from about 0.1 to 1.0 cm in diameter. There is also 
about a 0.2 cm nodular aggregate of similar-appearing tan tumor on the serosal surface of the fallopian 
tube. 
There is about a 0.3 cm diameter fiuid-filled thin-walled paratubal cyst. Adhesions on the adnexa are also 
noted. 
A gross photograph of the specimen is obtained.

Labeled with the patient's name, labeled ""right tube and ovarY', and received fresh in the Operating 
Room for study, and subsequently fixed in formalin is a 26.7 gram salpingo-oophorectomy 
specimen. The ovary was incised at the time of intraoperative consultation. The ovary is about 4.5 x 3.5 
x 2.5 em. The adjacent fimbriated fallopian tube is 5.0 cm long and ranges from 0.6 to 1.0 cm in diameter 
with a maximum luminal diameter of about 0.3 cm. 
The ovary is subtotally replaced by firm white-yellow tumor. The tumor within the ovary is about 2.5 cm in 
maximum dimension. There are also several nodular and plaque like aggregates of firm tan-white tumor 
on the serosal surface of the ovary. The latter of which ranges from about 0.2 to 1.0 cm in diameter. The 
fallopian tube appears to be partially replaced by tan-white semisoft to firmer tumor. Tumor in the 
fallopian tube involves the mucosa, wall and focally obstructs the lumen of the fallopian tube. 
Attached to the fallopian tube, there is a thin-walled translucent fluid-filled paratubal cyst that is about 0.2 
cm in diameter. 
A photograph of the specimen is obtained.

 endometrial cavity is about 3.5 cm long and up to 2.0 cm in width. The endometrial mucosa ranges from 
about 0.1 to 0.3 cm in thickness. The muscular uterine wall ranges from about 1.5 to 2.5 cm in thickness. 
Attached to the cervix, there is an up to 0.3 cm long cuff of vaginal mucosa. 
The serosal surface of the uterus and outer aspect of the cervix are partially coated by nodular and 
plaque-like aggregates of firm tan tumor. The tumor deposits on the external aspect of the uterus and 
cervix range from about 0.5 to 1.5 cm in maximum dimension. Cut sections of the anterior uterine corpus 
reveal a mass of tan-white tumor that is mostly firm but shows areas of softening that involve the 
muscular wall of the uterus. The intramural portion of the tumor is about 4.0 cm in maximum dimension. 
There are also a few areas of induration of the endometrial mucosa which are tan-white and up to 0.3 cm 
in diameter that may represent tumor. Most of the tumor in the uterus and cervix appear to represent 
metastatic tumor. 
There is a well-circumscribed 1.3 cm diameter intramural leiomyoma in the anterior lower uterine 
segment that is composed of firm solid tan-white whorled tissue without grossly evident areas of 
hemorrhage or necrosis. Except for the areas of induration, noted above the endometrial mucosa is 
grossly unremarkable. The cervix shows a few mucus-filled cysts, the largest of which is about 0.3 cm in 
diameter. Representative sections are submitted.

Page 6 of 6 Printed from"," Site: Omentum and Right Breast
The presence of a tumor in the omentum indicates a primary site of omental cancer, while the location of the tumor in the right breast is provided in the pathology report.

Laterality: Right
The laterality is specified as right for the breast tumor. The absence of information about the laterality of the omental tumor can be interpreted as not provided or unknown.

Histology: Ductal Adenocarcinoma and Not Specified
The histologic classification of the invasive tumor in the breast is ductal adenocarcinoma, while the type of cancer in the omentum is not specified but can be inferred as some form of metastatic carcinoma.

Stage: IIIC and Stage I
The primary omental tumor is classified as stage IIIC (T3c/N0/M0) based on the TNM staging system, while the breast tumor is classified as stage I (T1b pNO/ MO). The overall AJCC stage for each cancer may differ due to differences in their respective stages.

Grade: III and G3
The Page & Anderson grade of the invasive tumor in the breast is III, while the Broders' grade is G3, both indicating poorly-differentiated carcinoma. The grade of the omental tumor is not specified but can be assumed to have a similar grade based on its advanced stage.

Behavior: Malignant for Both
Both tumors are malignant in behavior, as indicated by their classification as carcinomas and their respective stages."
