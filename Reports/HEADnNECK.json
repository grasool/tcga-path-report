        "llm_output": " Site: Multiple sites including left constrictor muscle, soft palate margin, lateral pharyngeal margin, left tongue base margin, posterior tonsillar pillar margin, and left radical tonsillectomy. Justification: The report includes separate descriptions for each specimen received, indicating different surgical margins and the main tumor site.\n\nLaterality: Left side of the oral cavity and oropharynx. Justification: All the sites and specimens mentioned in the report are from the left side, indicating that the surgery was performed on the left side.\n\nHistology: Squamous cell carcinoma. Justification: The report mentions \"in situ carcinoma\" and \"invasive carcinoma,\" which are types of squamous cell carcinoma. Additionally, the tumor cells are strongly positive for p16, indicating a high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, which is commonly associated with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.\n\nStage: Not provided. Justification: The report does not include information about the size of the tumor or the presence of metastasis, which are necessary for determining the stage of the cancer.\n\nGrade: Not provided. Justification: The report does not include information about the differentiation of the tumor cells, which is necessary for determining the grade of the cancer.\n\nBehavior: Malignant. Justification: The report mentions \"in situ carcinoma\" and \"invasive carcinoma,\" indicating that the tumor has the potential to invade surrounding tissues and metastasize, which is characteristic of malignant behavior."

The larynx is opened posteriorly on the midline at the\ntime of frozen section analysis. There are three tracheal rings attached.\nThere is a tan -white appearing mass measuring 2.5 x 1.9 cm in surface area and 2.2 cm in thickness involving the\nglottic larynx. The mass is grossly located on the bilateral false cord, vestibule true cord and crosses the midline.\nThe mass does not appear to involve pyriform sinus. Grossly, the mass extends 2.4 cm from the tip of the epiglottic\nmucosal edge, 2.3 cm from the base of the tongue mucosal edge, 2.4 cm from the lateral right mucosal edge, 1.1 cm\nfrom the lateral left mucosal edge and 3.1 cm from the distal tracheal edge. None of the tracheal rings grossly\nappear involved the mass. On the anterior aspect of the specimen is an ellipse of abnormal skin measuring 4.5 x 4.3\nx 1.0 cm. The inferior aspect of the skin ellipse measures 2.3 cm from the distal tracheal edge. A tan-white, irregular\nulceration is identified measuring 2.2 x 1.7 cm and is present 2.5 cm from the inferior skin edge, 1.6 cm from the left\nskin edge, 1.1 cm from the right skin edge and 0.9 cm from the superior skin edge. The skin defect grossly does not\nappear to communicate with the mass lesion. There is a left lobe of the thyroid gland present. The cut surface is\nhomogenous and beefy red. A colloid nodule measuring 1.3 x 1.1 x 0.5 cm is noted. On sectioning, the lesion\ngrossly invades the anterior commissure as well as the pre-epiglottic space as well as possible full thickness invasion\nof the thyroid cartilage. Sections are taken as listed in the cassette summary after decalcification. Representative\nsection of tumor is submitted for Tumor Bank at the time of frozen section analysis.

Received are 2, irregular, soft to \nrubbery, tan, \n tissue biopsies each measuring 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm.  A touch prep is \nperformed \nwith an intraoperative diagnosis completed. The specimen is entirely \nsubmitted \nfor processing in a cassette labeled 1A.  \nPart 2 is received fresh labeled with the patient's name, initials xx and \n\"right zone 2B node\".  Received is a single, tan, oval, soft to \nrubbery, lymph \nnode measuring 0.5 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm.  The specimen is inked, bisected and \nentirely submitted for processing in a cassette labeled 2A.  \nPart 3 is received fresh labeled with the patient's name, initials xx \nand \n\"right neck level 2, 3, and 4\".  Received is an irregular unoriented 13 \nx 4.5 \nx 1.3 cm right selective neck dissection, presumably lymph node levels \n2 \nthrough 4 without an orienting suture.  Neck dissection is divided \nequally \ninto 3 segments.  The measurements for the lymph node- containing soft \ntissue \nlevels are as follows: Level A- 4.2 X 3.5 X 1.5 cm, level B-  4.3 x 4 x \n1.0 cm, \nand level C-  4 x 3.2 x 1.5 cm.  Multiple lymph nodes, ranging from 0.2 \nto 2.0 \ncm in greatest dimension are identified.  Several of the larger lymph nodes \nappear to be tumor involved and are present in greater numbers within \nlevel A. \n  Lymph nodes are entirely submitted in cassettes labeled: \n3A - level A -  six possible lymph nodes \n3B - level A- six possible lymph nodes \n3C - level A - single bisected lymph node \n3D - level A single bisected lymph node \n3E - level B- seven possible lymph nodes \n3F - level C- 9 possible lymph nodes \nPart 4 is received fresh labeled with the patient's name, initials xx \nand \n\"left neck level 2, 3 and 4\".  Received is an irregular unoriented 11.5 \nx 6 x \n1.2 cm left selective neck dissection, presumably lymph node levels 2 through \n4 without an orienting suture.  Neck dissection is divided equally into \n3 \nsegments.  The measurements for the lymph node- containing soft tissue \nlevels are as follows: Level A- 4.3 X 3.5 X 1.25 cm, level B-  5.5 x 3.1 x 0.8 \ncm, and level C-  4 x 3 x 1.2 cm.  Multiple lymph nodes, ranging from 0.2 to 2.0 \ncm in greatest dimension are identified.  Several of the larger lymph nodes appear \nto be tumor involved and are present in greater numbers within level A.   \nLymph nodes are entirely submitted in cassettes labeled: \n4A - level A -  four possible lymph nodes \n4B - level A-  single possible lymph node \n4C  level B-  seven lymph node  4D  level B - one lymph node \n4E - level C- eight possible lymph nodes \n4F - level C- three possible lymph nodes \nPart 5 is received fresh labeled with the patient's name, initials xx \nand \n\"larynx\".   The specimen consists of total laryngectomy measuring 8.5 cm \n(superior to inferior), by 4.2 cm (anterior to posterior), by 5.8 cm \n(width) \nwhen reconstructed.  The specimen includes the hyoid bone which is \nremoved.  \nThe hyoid bone measures 8.2 cm in length by 0.3 x 0.3 cm in greatest \ndimension.  One tracheal ring is identified.  There is a supraglottic \nirregular exophytic ulcerated mass measuring at least 2.8 x 2.2 cm in \nmaximal \ndimension.  The tumor is centered at the level of the supraglotttis and more \nprominent and cavitary toward the right side.  The tumor appears to \ncompress/invade the right and left false vocal cords as well as the \nanterior \npyriform sinus.  The tumor is grossly located at 1.3 cm from the right arytenoid mucosal margin, 1.8 cm from the left arytenoid margin, 3.0 cm \nfrom \nthe epiglottic margin and at 3.2 cm from the jugular margin (inferior).  \nThe \nanterior soft tissue margin appears intact and no gross lesion is identified.  \nUpon sectioning the tumor measures 4.8 cm superior to inferior by 3.2 cm \nanterior to posterior, by 4.5 cm in width.  It involves the pre-\nepiglottic space, paraglottic space and anterior soft tissue.  The tumor appears \nto \nsuperficially invade the thyroid cartilage as well as epiglottic \ncartilage.  \nThe anterior soft tissue margin including muscle and fibroadipose tissue \nappears uninvolved by tumor.  The right thyroid lobe is identified \nmeasuring \n3.2 x 2.5 x 0.8 cm in greatest dimension.  No parathyroid tissue is \nidentified.  On section no discrete, well circumscribed or ill defined \nlesions \nen.  A section of the tumor was selected and   \n \ni red and banked.  The specimen is submitted in fourteen cassettes as follows: \n5A  epiglottic margin, perpendicular \n5B  tracheal (deep) margin, shaved \n5C  right arytenoid margin, perpendicular \n5D  left arytenoid margin, perpendicular 5E  right anterior soft tissue margin  (area inked blue is not a \nmargin)  \n5F  tumor and thyroid cartilage right side \n5G  supraglottic tumor area right side \n5H  - ventricle tumor area right side \n5I  anterior soft tissue margin left side \n 5J  tumor and epiglottic cartilage \n5K  ventricle tumor area left side \n5L  tumor and thyroid cartilage left side \n5M  5N  representative section of thyroid gland.  \nOn Part 5 cassettes A, B, F, H, J and L will be placed in decalcifying \nl ion. \n/ \n \nONSULTATION: \n1AFS:  RIGHT SUPRAGLOTTIC LESION, BIOPSY (touch prep )- \nA.

        "llm_output": " Site: The specimens are from various sites including the right and left neck dissections, base of tongue, left lateral pharynx, and larynx. This is necessary to examine the extent of the malignancy.\n\nLaterality: The tumors are located on both sides of the body, with one on the right laryngectomy and the other on the glottic segment of the left laryngectomy. This information is crucial for determining the appropriate treatment.\n\nHistology: Both tumors are moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinomas. This type of cancer is common in the head and neck region, and the histological grade helps determine the aggressiveness of the tumor.\n\nStage: The right laryngectomy tumor is staged as pT3 pN2c, indicating a relatively advanced stage of cancer with positive lymph nodes. The left glottic tumor is staged as pT1a pN0, indicating an early-stage cancer without positive lymph nodes.\n\nGrade: Both tumors are moderately differentiated, which suggests an intermediate level of aggressiveness. This information is important for determining the prognosis and appropriate treatment.\n\nBehavior: The behavior of the tumor is malignant, as it is a cancer that can invade surrounding tissues and metastasize to other parts of the body. This information is crucial for determining the appropriate treatment and follow-up care.\n\nNot provided: Other categories such as chemoradiation therapy, organ transplant, immunosuppression, and cytogenetics tests are not provided in the report. These factors can influence the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, and it is important to obtain this information from the medical record or the treating physician."

Part 1 is designated \"right level 1B neck dissection\".  It consists of a  \nsubmandibular gland (3 x 2.5 x 2 cm) and attached fibroadipose tissue (6.5 x  \n4.5 x 2.5 cm).  The cut surface of the gland is tan -white a nd multilobated.  \nFour lymph nodes are identified in the fibroadipose tissue varying in size  \nfrom 1.2 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm to 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm.  Representative sections are  \nsubmitted as follows:  \n1A  submandibular gland  \n1B  one lymph node bisected  \n1C  two lymph  nodes  \n1D  two lymph nodes.  \nPart 2 is designated \"right hemiglossectomy\".  The specimen measures 7 x 6 x  \n 3.5 cm overall.  The lateral surface shows two ulcers measuring 3.5 x 2.5 cm  \n(ulcer #1) and 1.5 x 1 cm (ulcer #2), respectively.  The larger ulcer is 1 cm  \nfrom the anterior margin, 1.4 cm from the dorsal/deep margin and 1.1 cm away  \nfrom the ventral/deep margin.  The smaller ulcer is 0.5 cm away from the  \ndorsal/deep margin and 2.5 cm away from the ventral/deep margin and 0.5 cm  \nfrom the posterior margin.   All the margins were evaluated intraoperatively.  \nOn serial sectioning, the larger ulcer shows a tan white mass (1.2 cm deep).  \nThe smaller ulcer also shows a tan white mass (0.2 cm in depth).  The two  \nmasses grossly appear to be continuous with each othe r.  \nInk code:  \nBlue  ventral/deep  \nGreen  dorsal/deep  \nYellow  anterior  \nOrange  soft palate/posterior  \nRed  area banked.   \nDigital images are taken.

Specimen\nhas a pale tan cut surface. Entirely submitted in Al.\nB)Received in a container of formalin labeled \"..., right neck dissection\"\nis a 10 x 4.8 x 2 cm yellow lobulated portion of fibrofatty tissue. There is\na double suture attached to the level II region and a single suture attached\nto the level IV region. The specimen is sectioned and in the level II region\nthere is a 4.5 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm tan lobulated salivary gland. It is serially\nsectioned and has tan lobulated cut surfaces. No masses or lesions are\nidentified. The specimen is divided into levels II, III, IV, and V. In the\nlevel II region there is a 2 x 2 x 1 cm previously incised tan-gray friable\napparent grossly involved lymph node. The remaining regions are sectioned\nand have fibrofatty cut surfaces and numerous candidate lymph nodes are\nidentified ranging from 0.1-2.5 cm in greatest dimension. No additional\nmetastatic disease is grossly appreciated. Representative sections are\nsubmitted as follows: B1 - salivary gland; B2 - sections of grossly involved\nlevel II lymph node; B3 - two level II bisected lymph nodes, one inked blue;\nB4 - three level III candidate lymph nodes; B5 - seven level IV candidate\nlymph nodes; B6 - one bisected level IV lymph node; B7 - four level V\ncandidate lymph nodes; B8 - four level V candidate lymph nodes; B9 - one\nbisected level V lymph node; B10 - one bisected level V lymph node.\nC)Received fresh designated \"right level V\" is one piece of yellow\nfibrofatty tissue measuring 4 x 2 x 0.5 cm. The specimen is examined for\npotential lymph nodes and seven potential lymph node candidates are\nidentified. The largest candidate is inked black and bisected, and all lymph\nnode candidates are submitted in cassette Cl.\nD)Received fresh designated \"inferior margin\" is a 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm\npiece of whitish red fibrous tissue, which is inked black and entirely\nsubmitted for frozen section analysis, after which it is thawed and submitted\nin cassette\nE)Received fresh designated \"right composite resection, single stitch\nanterior lateral, double stitch posterior medial\" is a 5.8 x 5.2 x 5.4 cm\ncomposite resection including a portion of the bony maxilla with three teeth,\nthe soft tissue lateral to the mandible, and associated soft tissue superior\nto the mandible including a portion of a lower molar (mandibular bone is not\npresent). The buccal surface of the oral cavity, lateral to the teeth, has\nan exophytic, friable lesion which extends along the posterior mucosal\nsurface to the medial aspect of the specimen where it is present medial to\nthe upper and lower teeth. Grossly, this exophytic lesion is at least 2.5 x\n3.5 x 2.5 cm on initial examination. The egdes of the lesion are grossly 0.5\ncm from the posterior mucosal margin, 0.8 cm from the inferior mucosal\nmargin, 0.5 cm from the anterior mucosal margin, and 0.5 cm from the superior\nmucosal margin. On initial gross examination, this lesion does not appear to\nextend through the fibrofatty tissue located lateral to the buccal surface. Using the orientation provided per surgeon (single stitch anterior lateral,\ndouble stitch posterior medial), the mucosal margins are inked in the\nfollowing manner: anterior = blue; superior = black; medial = red; inferior\n= green. The lateral soft tissue margin is inked orange, the inferior soft\ntissue is inked green, the superior soft tissue is inked black, the medial\nsoft tissue is inked red, and the posterior soft tissue margin is inked blue\nover green. Representative shave margins are taken from the inferior and\nanterior mucosal surfaces. The specimen is then cut in a transverse plane,\nseparating the maxilla from the mandibular soft tissue, and each piece is\nserially sectioned. The tumor has a firm white cut surface, with friable\nareas, and grossly extends to within 0.1 mm of the deep inked margin (blue\nover green), within 0.1 cm of the inked medial soft tissue margin (red),\nwithin 0.1 cm of the inked lateral soft tissue margin (orange),and within 0.2\ncm of the inferior soft tissue margin (green). On sectioning, the tumor\nappears larger than on original examination, and measures 4.5 x 4.0 x 2.5 cm.\nThe upper maxillary bone is focally sectioned and has foci suspicious for\nbony involvement; these areas are submitted for decalcification.\nCassette summary: El - representative shave margins from the inferior and\nanterior mucosal margins; E2 - representative perpendicular margins from the\nmedial and superior mucosal margins; E3 - representative sections of neoplasm\nin relationship to deep soft tissue margin; E4 - relationship of neoplasm and\nclosest medial soft tissue margin; E5 - relationship of neoplasm and closest\nlateral soft tissue margin; E6 - relationship of neoplasm and superior soft\ntissue margin; E7 - representative sections of superior upper lateral mucosa\nin relationship to inked mucosal margin; E8 - relationship of neoplasm and\ninferior inked margin; E9-E10 - composite cross section through neoplasm;\nEll- E12 - upper maxillary bone..\nF)Received fresh designated \"buccal tumor\" is one piece of whitish red\nfibrous tissue, 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm.

One side of the specimen is white-tan, somewhat granular and\nfirm. It is probably covered by mucosa. The specimen is serially sectioned perpendicular to the\nmucosal surface. On cut surface there is an ill-defined, pale tan-white, firm nodule 1.5 x 1.2 x 1.5\ncm in greatest dimension. It grossly approaches the deep, inked margin. The specimen is entirely\nsubmitted in cassettes Al-A3. B) Received unfixed designated right modified radical neck\ndissection, double long = level II, double short = level IV is an 18 x 8 x 3 cm in greatest\ndimensions right neck dissection specimen with surgical sutures designating levels II and IV.\nThe specimen is multinodular with multiple grossly positive lymph nodes in levels II and III\nincluding a complex of matted nodes that involves both levels; one node is received cut across. A\n10 x 3 x 1.5 cm portion of sternocleidomastoid muscle is identified on the anterior aspect of the\nspecimen. On the medial aspect of the muscle there is a suture-tied on both ends, 7 cm long x 0.5\ncm in outer diameter vessel (internal jugular vein). Additional portion of a vessel 3 cm long is\npresent in level I lateral to the salivary gland tissue. The salivary gland in level I measures 5 x 3\nx 1 cm and has a smooth tan-pink, lobulated, soft cut surface. The skeletal muscle adjacent to\ngrossly positive lymph nodes in the middle of the specimen, is not involved. The main complex\nof positive nodes measures 7 cm in greatest dimension and as previously described crosses both\nlevels II and III.

The specimen is\nentirely submitted for frozen section consultation and is resubmitted as E 1 FS (?). F) Received\nfresh, labeled \"maxilla, right\", is a right composite resection specimen comprising posterior\nmaxilla-and palatal resection. The specimen is 6.7 cm from anterior to posterior, 4.3 cm from\nmedial to lateral, and 3.5 cm from superior to inferior. The anterior mucosal surface has two\nteeth with silver metal fillings; one is 0.8 cm in greatest dimension, and the other is 1.3 cm in\ngreatest dimension. A 2.7 x 1.4 cm depressed, indurated lesion is immediately posterior to the\nteeth. The lesion has a central 2.2 x 0.6 cm defect consistent with excision of tumor for research.\nThe edge of the lesion is tan-white, dusky, and edematous, and it has a rolled edge. The lesion\nextends 0.3 cm from the nearest lateral mucosal margin, 0.5 cm from the nearest posterior\nmucosal margin, and 1.1 cm from the nearest medial mucosal margin. The anterior mucosal\nmargin is 1.8 cm from the lesion. The remainder of the mucosal surface is tan-pink, smooth and\nglistening. The underlying soft tissue margins consist of tan-yellow, lobulated adipose tissue and\nmaroon-brown possible muscle. No definite tumor is identified at the soft tissue surface. The\nmedial- superior aspect of the specimen has a 3.3 x 1.0 cm mucosal surface consistent with sinus\ncavity; the sinus mucosa is tan-pink, smooth and glistening with areas that are red-brown,\nroughened, and focally hemorrhagic. The specimen is inked as follows: anterior = red, medial\nanterior = black, medial posterior = green, superior = yellow, lateral = orange and posterior =\nblue. The specimen is serially sectioned from anterior to posterior to reveal a 5.2 x 4.1 x 3.5 cm,\ntan-white, poly-lobulated, firm mass which immediately underlies the previously described\nmucosal lesion. The mass appears to abut the posterior, superior, lateral, and medial soft tissue\nmargins. The mass abuts the posterior aspect of the most posterior tooth, and it does not appear\nto extend any farther anteriorly. Representative sections are submitted as follows: Ft - medial\nsinus soft tissue margin; F2, F3 - posterior soft tissue margins, perpendicular; F4-F6 - composite\ncross section of mid posterior plane of the specimen; F7 - anterior bone margin, en face (decal);\nF8-F 10 - composite cross section of mid anterior plane of the specimen (decal).

The report does not mention if the tumor is on the left or right side of the larynx.\n\nHistology: The histologic type is squamous cell carcinoma, conventional. This was determined by the description of the tumor and the histologic grade given as G2.\n\nStage: The pathologic staging (pTNM) is pT4a. This indicates that the tumor has grown into nearby tissues, such as the thyroid or tongue muscles, and/or into the larynx's outer covering.\n\nGrade: The histologic grade is G2, which means the cancer cells are moderately differentiated from normal cells. This was determined by the description of the tumor and the histologic grade given as G2.\n\nBehavior: The behavior of this tumor is malignant, meaning it invades nearby tissues and can spread to other parts of the body. This is inherent in the definition of cancer."

Site: The primary tumor location is not explicitly mentioned, but it seems to be a solid tumor involving an organ (possibly gastrointestinal or genitourinary based on some of the lab data).\n2. Laterality: Not provided.\n3. Histology: The histological type of the tumor is also not explicitly stated, but there are references to various cell types and patterns such as squamous, glandular, round cells, fibroblasts, and others.\n4. Stage: Based on the available lab data and diagnostic studies, it appears that the tumor has metastasized (pT3 N1 M1 stage). However, this information is incomplete and should be confirmed with additional clinical and pathological data.\n5. Grade: The grade of the tumor is not provided, but there are references to nuclear appearance, mitotic activity, and cellular differentiation which could be used to determine the grade if more specific information were available.\n6. Behavior: Given the presence of metastasis, this tumor is behaving aggressively (malignant).\n\nIt's important to note that a definitive diagnosis cannot be made with the provided incomplete form, and additional clinical and pathological data would be necessary for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan."

' wasC?61, 9\nGROSS DESCRIPTION: A) Received fresh designated \"base of the tongue\" is a 3.2 x 2.5 x 0.5940cm exophytic, pedunculated soft hemorrhagic mass and underlying mucosa. The specimen has\nbeen oriented by the surgeon. The specimen is inked as follows: medial blue, posterior orange,\nanterior red, lateral green, and deep black. A 0.5 cm in diameter portion of tissue is obtained for\nresearch purposes and this area is inked yellow. The specimen is longitudinally sectioned to\nreveal a white-tan, firm, ill defined mass that appears to extend to the deep black and red inked\nmargins, closely approaches medial and lateral margins and it is located at least 1 cm from the\norange inked margin. Representative sections submitted as follows: AFS 1 - central portion of the\nlesion submitted for frozen section then thawed and submitted for permanent section; A2, A3 -\ncentral portion of mass longitudinally sectioned; A4 -anterior medial margin perpendicularly\nsectioned; A5 - posterior medial margin perpendicularly sectioned; A6 - anterior lateral margin\nperpendicularly sectioned; A7-A8 - posterior lateral margin perpendicularly sectioned. B)\nReceived fresh designated \"medial margin\" is a 0.7 x 0.6 x 0.3 cm portion of tissue, which is\nsubmitted for frozen section, then thawed and resubmitted in cassette BFS 1. C) No specimen is\nreceived. D) Received fresh designated \" anterior lateral margin\" is a 1.2 x 0.7 x 0.2 cm portion\nof tissue that is partially covered by mucosa. The specimen has been oriented by the surgeon:\ndeep margin inked black, the cut side yellow, and free border blue. The specimen is entirely\nsubmitted for frozen section, then thawed and resubmitted in cassette DFS 1. E) Received fresh\ndesignated \" anterior medial margin\" is a 1.2 x 1.0 x 0.2 cm portion of tissue that is partially\ncovered by mucosa. The true deep margin is inked black, the cut surface yellow, and free border\nblue. The specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section, then thawed and resubmitted in\ncassette EFS 1. F) Received in formalin designated \"right level IIA and level III\" is a 7 cm x 3 x\n2.5 cm specimen that has been oriented by the surgeon with a double long stitch designated\n\"level IIA superior, single long stitch designated IIA inferior and double short stitch designated\nlevel III. The specimen is equally divided in three portions and bluntly dissected to reveal a 2.5\ncm in diameter grossly positive lymph node predominantly in level IIA inferior but also\ninvolving level III. Additional lymph nodes are identified. Representative sections submitted as\nfollows: F 1-F2 - level IIA superior entirely submitted individual lymph node candidates; F3 -\ngrossly positive lymph node predominantly level IIA inferior and level III; F4 - level III entirely\nsubmitted.

Sectioning reveals a mixed tan and\nhemorrhagic parenchyma consistent with lymph node with one pole that has a\nsolid uniform white appearance. The specimen is sectioned and submitted\nentirely in cassettes Al - A3.\nB)Received in formalin as left lowest cervical node is a 0.7 cm greatest\ndimension firm tan nodule surrounded by small amounts of fibrofatty tissue.\nSectioning reveals a uniformly tan parenchyma. The bisected specimen is\nsubmitted entirely in cassette B1.\nC)Received fresh as left neck dissection is an unoriented complex 10 x 8\nx 3 cm specimen consisting of muscle and fibrofatty tissue and a large vein.\nIt is divided into levels 2 - 5. Anteriorly and immediately adjacent to a\nmajor vein is a 7 x 4 x 3 cm white mass that is 80-90% necrotic grossly and\nis present throughout levels 2 - 4. Very little of the mass appears viable.\nIt lies next to a major vein but does not appear to invade the lumen of the\nvessel grossly. Multiple nodules are dissected from each level and submitted\nentirely. Cassette summary: C1 - C4 - 7 cm necrotic mass with relation to\nvessel - level 2; C5 - five level 2 nodules; C6 - three level 2 nodules; C7 -\nthree level 2 nodules; C8 - C9 - two level 3 nodules in each; C10 - four\nlevel 4 nodules; Cll - two level 5 nodules; C12 - five level 5 nodules; C13 -\nthree level 5 nodules; C14 - five level 5 nodules.\nD)Received fresh as left level 1 is a 4 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm aggregate of\ntan/yellow soft tissue that has a minimally lobular appearance. It is\ndiffusely thick and firm. No definite lymph nodes are identified.\nRepresentative sections are submitted in D1 - D5 (approximately 75%\nsubmitted).\nE)Received in formalin as proximal lingual nerve is a 0.5 cm irregular\nshaped piece of tan-white tissue with a minimally exophytic appearance on one\nsurface. The entire specimen is submitted in cassette El.\nF)Received in formalin as left sublingual gland is a 4.5 x 2 x 1 cm tan\nlobular piece of soft tissue. Sectioning reveals approximately half the\nspecimen is composed of a lobular tan tissue consistent with salivary gland.\nAt one end is a 1.6 cm firm nodule composed of similar lobular tan tissue.\nThe entire specimen is submitted in Fl - F4.\nG)Received fresh as left tonsil mass is an ovoid piece of red soft\ntissue with a pink shiny mucosal surface measuring 4.6 x 3.5 x 2.2 cm\nconsistent with tonsil. At one pole the structure is a short stitch\ndesignated inferior. Attached to this is a 4.5 x 3 x 0.5 cm triangular piece\nof red soft tissue that appears to be skeletal muscle with a suture\ndesignating medial pterygoid. The medial edge of the tonsil is inked blue\nand lateral black. In the center of the mucosa is a 1.5 cm ovoid hole that\nappears to contain a yellow-tan exophytic mass. Sectioning reveals a 4.5 x 3.5 x 2 cm mass grossly extending through the majority of the specimen. The\nmedial pterygoid muscle does not appear to be involved. Grossly the mass\nextends to medial margin and is less than 0.1 cm from the lateral margin at\nthe inferior tip. The mass grossly approaches both lateral and medial\nmargins within 0.1 cm at the superior tip. The inferior and superior tips\nare sectioned perpendicularly then into parallel sections.\nCassette summary: G1-G2 - inferior tip; G3-G4 - superior tip; G5-G8 -\ncomplete cross sections from medial to lateral direction from inferior to\nsuperior pole (one complete cross section in G6 -G7 and G8-G9); G10 -\nrepresentative skeletal muscle.\nH)Received in formalin as left level 5 lymph node is a 3 x 2 x 1 cm\naggregate of fibrofatty tissue containing approximately nine nodules ranging\nfrom 0.3 to 1.1 cm.

There is a polypoid lesion, which is made up of spindled \nand epithelioid dyscohesive cells that show a high mitotic activity and pleomorphism, consistent with high- grade spindle cell neoplasm. Foci within this polyp also show typical squamous cell \ncarcinoma. The second specimen is made up of a large area of squamous dysplasia with early invasive conventional squamous cell carcinoma, moderately differentiated. The conventional squamous cell carcinoma is seen within 0.3 cm of the lateral and deep margins. The sarcomatoid carcinoma component is largely confined to the exophytic polyp and is not seen near the margins. The tumor thickness of the early invasive component is 0.3 cm, however the total thickness taking into account the polypoid lesion is 1.5 cm.  \n \n \n \n  \nClinical History  \noral tongue cancer  \n \nGross Description  \n1.

Site: The report does not provide a specific site, only mentioning different levels of neck dissections and right and left sides. However, there are references to the base of tongue, submandibular gland, and parotid gland, so we can infer that the site is related to one or more of these areas.\n2. Laterality: The report mentions both left and right neck dissections, indicating that the procedure was performed on both sides.\n3. Histology: The report does not provide a specific histological diagnosis, only mentioning the absence of tumor in some sections. However, there are references to adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, lymph nodes, and salivary glands, which suggest a possible diagnosis of a benign or malignant neoplasm of one of these tissues.\n4. Stage: The report does not provide information about the stage of the disease.\n5. Grade: The report does not provide information about the grade of the tumor.\n6. Behavior: Based on the mention of \"neoplasm\" and \"mass\" in the report, we can assume that the behavior is related to a neoplastic process, which could be benign or malignant.\n\nJustification for the choices: The information was extracted from the pathology report, which contains various sections describing the findings of different levels of neck dissections and other related procedures. Although some specific details are missing, there is enough information to make educated guesses about the site, laterality, histology, stage, grade, and behavior of the disease."

Step sectioning the salivary gland  \ncomponent reveals the usual tan lobulated architecture without distinct mass.  There are no intraparenchymal lymph nodes grossly identified.   Representative  \nsection of the salivary gland is submitted in cassette A1.   Within the  \nassociated fibrofatty tissues there are four probable lymph nodes, which range  \nfrom 0.2 to 1.3 cm in greatest dimension, none of which appear involved by  \n tumor, which are submitted as follows:  \n     A2      one whole probabl e lymph node;  \n     A3      three whole probable lymph nodes.  \n \nPart B is received additionally labeled \"rightperifacial lymph node\" and  \nconsists of a single portion of pink -tan nodular and yellow lobulated soft  \ntissue, all of which have aggregate dimensions of 2 x 1.4 x 0.8 cm.   Examination  \nof these tissues confirms the presence of two probable lymph nodes, 0.3 and 1.8  \ncm in greatest dimension, neither of which appear to have tumor involvement.  \nThese lymph node candidates are submitted as follows:       B1      one whole probable lymph node;  \n     B2      one whole probable lymph node bisected.  \n \nPart C is received additionally labeled \"right mandible composite resection  \n(margins taken from patient), single stitch margin right basilar tongue, double  \nstitch ri ght anterior buccal.\"   This composite specimen has aggregate dimensions  \nof 9 x 6 x 5 cm and consists of a partial resection of mandible, having  \ndimensions of 6 x 4.5 x 0.9 cm with associated adherent soft tissue, surfaced by  \nmucosa to include right buccal wall region of trigone, floor of mouth and  \napproaching base of tongue.   This soft tissue component has dimensions of 9 x  \n4.5 by up to 2 cm (base of tongue).    \n \nThe cut surfaces of the soft tissue component are inked in the following manner:  \n Base of tongue black (region of single suture), perimandibular tissues and  \nregion approaching trigone pharyngeal wall blue.    \n The mucosa of the specimen is remarkable for an area of probable leukoplakia,  \n3.5 x 2 cm with areas that are slightly raised up to 0.2 cm, superior/pharyngeal  \ntrigone region with an abutting separate nodular mass, which is 1.4 x 1.1 x 0.6  \ncm, grossly consistent with possible fibroma.   Subjacent to the area of fibroma \nand leukoplakia, there is a separate confluent area of presumed invasive tumor,  \n5.5 x 3.2 cm, which extends from the angle of the mandible/right buccal wall  \n(area of double tailed suture) confluent to the base of tongue region (see gross  \nphoto).   The area of leukoplakia approaches the posterior cut surface to within  \n0.4 cm, probable i nvasive mass approaches anterior cut surface of soft  \ntissue/mandible to within 0.5 cm and posteriorly 0.6 cm, as well as base of  \ntongue to within 0.4 cm.   The soft tissues are removed from the bony mandible  \ncomponent and there is gross evidence of tumor adherent to the surface of the  \nbone at the angle of the mandible and subsequent sectioning through this area of  \nadherent tumor reveals superficial involvement of cortical bone with no gross  \nevidence of deep invasion, to be confirmed microscopically (cassettes C4 and C5).  Sectioning through the region previously described as probable  \nleukoplakia, confirms superficial involvement of the mucosa and sectioning  \nthrough the abutting adjacent possible fibroma confirms its tan- white  \nhomogeneous cut surface without hemorrhage or necrosis.   Sectioning through the \nprimary mass reveals verrucoid change, as well as grossly invasive tumor to a  \ndepth of 0.7 cm, which correlates with the region previously abutting the  \nmandible (see cassettes C9- 11).   Step sectioning through  the confluent tumor,  \nwhich approaches base of tongue, reveals invasion to a depth of 0.4 cm and  approaches to within 0.7 cm of the deep cut surface base of tongue (see cassette \nC12 and C13).    \n \nSections are submitted as follows:  \n     C1      anterior mandible margin of surgical resection following  \ndecalcification;  \n     C2      posterior mandible bony margin of resection following  \ndecalcification;  \n     C3      superior pole mandible following decalcification;  \n     C4 -5     sections of mandible with adheren t tumor following  \ndecalcification;  \n     C6      area of leukoplakia;  \n     C7      area of leukoplakia with abutting probable fibroma;  \n     C8 -10     primary mass to include angle of mandible;  \n     C11      tumor approaching angle of mandible and base of t ongue region;  \n     C12 -13     tumor to greatest depth of invasion, base of tongue region.  \n \nPart D is received additionally labeled \"right buccal fat pad (FSD)\" and  \nconsists of a single portion of yellow lobulated fibrofatty tissue, 2.5 x 2.5 x  \n0.3 cm, which is submitted for frozen section evaluation (FSD) with residual  \nfrozen section tissue submitted in cassette D.  \n Part E is received additionally labeled \"right sublingual gland (FSE)\" and  \nconsists of a 3 x 2.5 x 0.3 cm portion of pink -tan to yellow soft  tissue, which  \nis submitted for frozen section evaluation (FSE) with residual frozen section  \ntissue submitted in cassette E.  \n Part F is received additionally labeled \"dorsal tongue margin (FSF)\" and  \nconsists of a partially fragmented portion of pink -tan s oft tissue, having  \naggregate dimensions of 1.8 x 1 x 0.3 cm.

These tissues are submitted for frozen section evaluation  \n(FSM) with residual frozen section tissue submitted in  cassette M.  \n Part N is received additionally labeled \"glossal tonsillar sulcus (FSN)\" and  \nconsists of two portions of pink -tan irregular soft tissues, not otherwise  \ndesignated, having greatest dimensions of 0.6 and 0.8 cm, submitted for frozen  \nsection ev aluation (FSN) with residual frozen section tissue submitted in  \ncassette N.  \n Part O is received additionally labeled \"right deep buccal margin (FSO)\" and  \nconsists of a portion of yellow lobulated fibrofatty tissue, which is 1.4 x 1 x  \n0.3 cm, submitted for  frozen section evaluation (FSO) with residual frozen  \nsection tissue submitted in cassette O.  \n Part P is received additionally labeled \"right temporalis margin (FSP)\" and  \nconsists of a single portion of red- brown soft tissue, which is 1.5 x 0.8 x 0.3  \ncm, submitted for frozen section evaluation (FSP) with residual frozen section  \ntissue submitted in cassette P.  \n Part Q is received additionally labeled \"medial pterygoid margin (FSQ)\" and  \nconsists of a partially fragmented portion of red- brown soft tissue, wh ich is 2  \nx 1.3 x 0.3 cm, submitted for frozen section evaluation (FSQ) with residual  \nfrozen section tissue submitted in cassette Q.  \n Part R is received additionally labeled \"right parotid mass (FSR+X)\" and  \nconsists of an ovoid portion of pink -tan soft tis sue, 2.4 x 1.4 x 1 cm, having  \nno orientation offered or possible. This tissue is inked and representative  \nsection is submitted for frozen section evaluation (FSR) with residual frozen  \nsection tissue submitted in cassette R1.   The remaining tissue is submit ted in  \ncassettes R2 and R3.   The specimen has been submitted in its entirety.  \n  Part S is received additionally labeled \"maxillary bone\" and consists of  \napparent multiple fragments of bone admixed with soft tissues, all of which have  \naggregate dimensions of 1.5 x 1.2 x 0.3 cm.   These tissues are submitted in toto  \nin cassette S following decalcification.  \n \nPart T is received additionally labeled \"right neck dissection, single stitch  \nlevel 2\" and consists of the product of a modified right neck dissection, having  \ndimensions of 6 x 2.8 x 1.5 cm, having a suture at one pole indicating a level  \nII location.   \n Within the level II there are three probable lymph nodes, which range from 0.8 to 2.2 cm in greatest dimension.   There is no gross evidence of tumor  \ninvolve ment within these lymph nodes.  \n The lymph node candidates are submitted as follows:  \n     T1      largest lymph node bisected;  \n     T2      two whole probable lymph nodes.  \n \nWithin level III there are two whole probable lymph nodes, having greatest  \ndimensi ons of 0.6 and 1 cm.   These lymph node candidates are submitted in  \ncassette T3 with remaining soft tissues from level III submitted in cassette T4 \nfor possible microscopic detection of additional lymph nodes.    \n \nWithin level IV there are five whole probabl e lymph nodes, which range from 0.2 \nto 1 cm in greatest dimension, submitted as follows:  \n     T5      two whole probable lymph nodes;  \n     T6      three whole probable lymph nodes;  \n     T7      remaining soft tissues from level IV for additional microscopi c \nexamination and possible detection of additional lymph  \n          nodes.  \n \nWithin level V there are two whole probable lymph nodes, 0.3 cm each in greatest  \ndimension, which are submitted in cassette T8 and remaining soft tissues from  \nlevel V are submitted in cassette T9 for possible detection of additional lymph  \nnodes.  \n \nMicroscopic Description:  \nHistologic examination reveals a right mandibular composite resection with right  \nneck dissection. The composite resection is prominent for a mucosal squamous  \ncell carcinoma demonstrating a papillary surface configuration with extensive  \nkeratinization. Invasion into the underlying connective tissue is seen in the  \nform of sheets and islands. Moderate differentiation is noted in areas. This  \narises from an extensive z one of carcinoma in situ and dysplasia across the  \nsurface of the specimen. The carcinoma focally erodes the cortex of the mandible but does not invade the medullary component. The associated lymph node  \ndissection fails to reveal the presence of metastatic disease.  \n  \nEND OF REPORT      \n      \n",

The larger fragment measures 0.9 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm and the smaller fragment measures 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm. Microscopic description: The tumor is composed of cells arranged in cords and nests, with focal comedo necrosis. The tumor cells have high nucleus to cytoplasm ratio, vesicular chromatin, and conspicuous nucleoli. Mitotic figures are easily identified. Immunohistochemical stains show the tumor cells to be positive for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2 neu. The background shows extensive lymphocytic infiltration.

Its epicenter is \nin the region of the submandibular salivary gland beneath the skin overlying the mandible. Grossly it involves the mandible and extends from the buccal \nsubcutaneous tissue medially to beneath the oral mucosa. The intervening soft tissue including the submandibular gland and skeletal muscle are \ninvolved by tumor. The tumor likely originates in the salivary gland and there is carcinoma in situ present in wharton's duct and there is no \ninvolvement of the epidermis or mucosa. Mucicarmine stains fail to \ndemonstrate intracytoplasmic mucin. Sections of mandible will be reported in \na supplemental report following decalcification. \nThe nodule of squamous cell carcinoma in the subdigastric area measures 1.2 cm in maximum dimension and likely represents an obllterated lymph node. \nThe largest lymph node metastasis completely replaces a lymph node measuring \n0.7 cm ln maximum dimension.

There are no apparent masses\nidentified. The specimen is separated in the mid portion. The superior\nportion represents level II soft tissue, while the inferior portion\nrepresents level III soft tissue. There are multiple lymph nodes identified.\nRepresentative sections are submitted as follows: Al, A2 - level II lymph\nnodes (Al- twelve (12) potential lymph nodes, A2- two (2) potential lymph\nnodes), A3, A4 - level III lymph nodes (A3- thirteen (13) potential lymph\nnodes and A4 - three (3) potential lymph nodes).\nB)Received in formalin designated \"left level IA\" are two tissue irregular\nsoft yellow fatty tissue, measuring 2.0 x 1.0 x 0.9 cm and 1.0 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm\nin greatest dimensions. There are four potential lymph nodes identified. All\nare submitted in cassette B1.\nC)Received fresh designated \"composite resection\" is an irregular piece of\nsoft tissue and bone, measuring 7.0 x 6.0 x 4.0 cm in greatest dimension. The\nbone is grossly consistent with a portion mandible, including part of the\nramus and posterior part of the body. On the medial aspect of the bone,\nthere is a irregular soft tissue partially covered with pink mucosa. On the\nanteroinferior aspect, a round lobule of normal appearing salivary gland is\nseen. Located in the center, there is an irregular ulcer identified,\nmeasuring 3.5 cm (anteroposterior plane) x 3 cm (superoinferior plane) x 1.3\ncm (mediolateral plane). The ulcer extends to within 0.5 cm of the anterior\nmucosal margin, 0.8 cm of the superolateral margin, 1.0 cm of the posterior\nmargin and 0.3 cm of the inferomedial resection margins. No apparent intact\ntonsil is identified. The attached salivary gland measures 3 x 1.9 x 1.5 cm\nin maximal dimension and appears grossly unremarkable. The soft tissue\nmargins are composed predominantly of irregular tissue including muscle and\nconnective tissue as well as occasional fat. The tumor is not identified on\nthe surgical margins.There appears to be a small hemorrhagic polyp that is\n0.4 cm x 0.3 cm extending off of the posterolateral surface of the tonsil.\nNo other gross abnormalities are identified. The specimen is inked as\nfollows:Anterior soft tissue margin - blue, inferomedial soft tissue margin\n- yellow, posterior soft tissue margin - black, and superolateral soft tissue\nmargin - orange. Serial sections of the specimen demonstrate grayish white,\nfirm tumor mass extending to within approximately 0.3 cm of the inferior (yellow) soft tissue margin, 0.7 cm from the superolateral (orange), and 0.1\ncm of the anterior soft tissue margin.\nRepresentative sections are submitted as follows: Cl, C2 - anterior\nresection margin (perpendicular to the inked margin); C,3, C4 - one complete\ncross section of the tumor (C3 is inferior to C4); C5, C6 - one complete\ncross section of the tumor (posterior to C3 and C4; C5 is inferior to C6);\nC7, C8 and Cli - posterior resection margin (perpendicular to the inked\nmargin; C7 is superior to C8); C9 - salivary gland; C10 - cross section of\nthe mandible (tissue submitted for decalcification).\nD)Received in formalin designated \"left level III\" is one piece of fatty\ntan-brown tissue measuring 1.2 x 1.2 x 1.3 cm. One potential lymph node is\nidentified, serially sectioned, and submitted entirely in D1.\nE)Received in formalin designated \"level V node\" is a single tan and\nyellow 1.7 x 1.3 x 0.9 cm piece of tissue. Five potential lymph nodes are\nidentified and are submitted in El.\nFINAL DIAGNOSIS:\nA)Lymph nodes, designated left neck dissection (level II and III),\nexcision: Metastatic carcinoma to one of 26 lymph nodes (1/11 level II lymph\nnodes and 0/15 level III lymph nodes).\nNo evidence of extracapsular soft tissue extension.\nB)Lymph nodes, designated left, level IA , excision: No evidence of\nmetastatic carcinoma in 4 lymph nodes (0/4).\nC)Tonsillar bed, portion of mandible and salivary gland, left, composite\nresection:\nInvasive squamous cell carcinoma, with the following features:\n1.Size: 3.5 cm in greatest dimension.\n2.Moderately differentiated.\n3.Carcinoma invades the underlying skeletal muscle, with very focal\ninvasion of minor salivary gland tissue; the submandibular salivary gland is\nfree of carcinoma.\n4.Foci of angiolymphatic and perineural space invasion are identified.\n5.The inked surgical margins are free of carcinoma. See comment. Invasive\ncarcinoma extends to within 0.1 cm of the anterior soft tissue resection\nmargin (C2), 0.1 cm of the cauterized inferomedial soft tissue resection\nmargin (C3),0.2 cm of the deep soft tissue resection margin (Cl), 0.4 cm of\nthe posterior soft tissue mucosal resection margin (Cll), and 0.9 cm of the\nsuperolateral soft tissue resection margin (C6).\n6.No gross bony invasion is identified; pending decalcification.\n7.No gross involvement of bony margins is seen; pending decalcification.\n8.See comment.\nD)Soft tissue, designated left, level III , excision: Benign fibroadipose\ntissue; no lymph nodes are identified.\nE)Lymph nodes, designated level V , excision: No evidence of metastatic\ncarcinoma in 5 lymph nodes (0/5).\nCOMMENT: Carcinoma approximates inked margins in C7 and C8, however, on correlation\nwith gross appearance these foci are interpreted as tissue tear-distortion\nwith ink run-off and not as true inked margins.\nThe minimal pTNM classification is pT2, pNl, pMx (AJCC staging manual, 6th\nedition, 2002). Assessment of bony invasion and bony margins is currently\npending (decalcification). The results will be reported as addendum.\nProcedures used to establish the diagnosis:\nSubmit tissue for decalcification\nADDENDUM REASON:\nThis addendum is issued to report the histologic findings in the\ndecalcification specimens. Additional representative bony margins are\nsubmitted in cassettes C12 and C13. The overall diagnosis remains unchanged.\nADDENDUM FINAL DIAGNOSIS:\nA)Lymph nodes, designated left neck dissection (level II and III),\nexcision:\nMetastatic carcinoma to one of 26 lymph nodes (1/11 level II lymph nodes and\n0/15 level III lymph nodes).\nNo evidence of extracapsular soft tissue extension.\nB)Lymph nodes, designated left, level IA , excision: No evidence of\nmetastatic carcinoma in 4 lymph nodes (0/4).\nTonsillar bed, portion of mandible and salivary gland, left, composite\nresection:\nInvasive squamous cell carcinoma, with the following features:\nSize: 3.5 cm in greatest dimension.\nModerately differentiated.\nCarcinoma invades the underlying skeletal muscle, with very focal invasion of\nminor salivary gland tissue; the submandibular salivary gland is free of\ncarcinoma.\nFoci of angiolymphatic and perineural space invasion are identified.\nThe inked surgical margins are free of carcinoma. See comment. Invasive\ncarcinoma extends to within 0.1 cm of the anterior soft tissue resection\nmargin(C2), 0.1 cm of the cauterized inferomedial soft tissue resection\nmargin (C3),0.2 cm of the deep soft tissue resection margin (Cl), 0.4 cm of\nthe posterior soft tissue mucosal resection margin (C11), and 0.9 cm of the\nsuperolateral soft tissue resection margin (C6).\nNo bony invasion is identified.\nBone margins with cellular marrow exhibiting trilineage maturation; no\nevidence of carcinoma.\nD)Soft tissue, designated left, level III , excision: Benign fibroadipose\ntissue; no lymph nodes are identified.\nE)Lymph nodes, designated level V , excision: No evidence of metastatic\ncarcinoma in 5 lymph nodes (0/5).\nCrtteriaDiagnosis Discrepanc y --P\nPrimary Tumor Site Discrepancy\nI{IPAA Discrepancy\nPrior Malignancy History\nnchronous i a N edal/SDyu\n... 1. r^^.rr.l\u2022 .UALIF1 / 5Ull^l 0\nReviewer Initialsate Reviewed :No",

        "llm_output": " Site: The site of the tumor is the oral cavity. This is based on the specimen type being a resection of a hemiglossectomy in the oral cavity.\n\nLaterality: Not provided, as the report does not mention the side of the body or mouth where the tumor is located.\n\nHistology: The histologic type of the tumor is squamous cell carcinoma, conventional. This is based on the microscopic examination and diagnosis provided in the report.\n\nStage: The tumor stage is pT2 pN2b pMX. This is based on the greatest dimension of the tumor being 3.5 cm (pT2), the involvement of 3 out of 2 regional lymph nodes examined (pN2b), and no evidence of distant metastasis (pMX).\n\nGrade: The histologic grade of the tumor is G2, which indicates moderate differentiation. This is based on the microscopic examination and diagnosis provided in the report.\n\nBehavior: The behavior of the tumor is malignant, as it is a cancer that has invaded surrounding tissues and metastasized to regional lymph nodes. This is based on the microscopic examination and diagnosis provided in the report."

This is based on the location where the specimens were taken from.\n\nLaterality: Laterality is only provided for container J, which refers to the left mandible. For all other containers, laterality is not provided.\n\nHistology: Histology is not explicitly provided in the descriptions. However, the presence of lymph nodes, tumors, and fatty fibroadipose tissue suggests different histologic types such as lymphoma, carcinoma, or adenocarcinoma.\n\nStage: The stage is not provided in the descriptions. This information is typically determined by the size of the tumor, its spread to nearby lymph nodes, and the presence of distant metastasis.\n\nGrade: The grade is also not provided in the descriptions. This refers to how abnormal the cancer cells look under a microscope, which can help predict how aggressive the cancer may be.\n\nBehavior: The behavior of the tumors is not explicitly stated but can be inferred as malignant based on the descriptions of their invasive properties and potential for metastasis.\n\nJustification: These six categories were chosen because they are commonly used to describe neoplastic processes, including tumor location (site), spread (laterality), appearance (histology), extent (stage), degree of differentiation (grade), and potential outcome (behavior)."

It consists of a complete larynx with attached tongue base, superior trachea and surrounding \nsoft tissue having an overall measurement of B.5 x 5.5 x 5.0 cm. The mucosal surface of the epiglottis shows a peripherally \nfungating, centrally ulcerating mass lesion that measures 3.5 x 2.B cm. The lesion Is centered approxlmalely 0.5 cm to Ihe left of \nthe midline and 3.1 cm Itom the tip of the epiglottis. The mass extends Inferiorly apparently Involving the left false vocal chord, \nobscuring Ihe left ventricle and abutting the superior surface of the left true chord. Oh the right. the mass appears to extend to the \nsuperior aspect of the false chord, compressing the right ventrlcie. The right true chord is edematous and expanded. Serial \nsections along the mid-sagittal plane al 3 mm intervals show the mass exlendlng Into the pre-epiglottic space (predomlnantiy on \nthe left), wllh extension between the hyoid bone and superior aspect of the thyroid cartilage. Mexlmum thickness of the lesion Is \napproximately 2.0 cm. The lesion appears to Invade into the base of the tongUe, bul remalhs 91 leasl 0.5 cm from the tongue base \nmargin.

Foreign body giant cell reaction within one of the level IIB nodes suggestive of reaction to\nnecrotic tumor.\n3. Submandibular gland with no evidence of carcinoma.\nE) Left lingual nerve, biopsy: Large nerve fascicle with no evidence of carcinoma.\nF) Peristyloid tissue, biopsy: Atypical cells suspicious for carcinoma.\nG) Left tonsil fossa, composite resection: Squamous cell carcinoma with the following:\n1. 5.0 cm greatest dimension.\n2.Moderately to poorly differentiated.\n3. Carcinoma infiltrates salivary glands and skeletal muscle (including tongue).\n4. Carcinoma is extensively present at the cauterized superior aspect of the lateral surgical\nmargin (G2), focally at the cauterized posterior margin (G6), closely approaching the\ninferolateral margin (G8), less than 0.1 cm to the medial uvula margin, and 0.4 cm from the\nmedial tongue margin.\nH) Styloid process, excision: Carcinoma present in soft tissue; adjacent bone uninvolved.\nCOMMENT: Minimum pathologic stage: pT4aN2bMX (AJCC 2002) Procedures used to\nestablish the diagnosis: I Submit tissue for decalcification\nADDENDUM REASON: This addendum is issued to report the size of the involved lymph\nnodes (all from part B) and the presence of extracapsular extension for the purpose of a clinical\ntrial enrollment. It was also noted that one of the level designations (part H, in bold below) and\nthe total number of nodes was incorrect in the final diagnosis. The remaining parts remain\nunchanged. The corrected diagnosis with the additional requested information is as follows:\nA-D, H) Lymph nodes, level 1 A, left selected neck, submandibular gland, left facial node, level\n5 node, dissections: Metastatic carcinoma present in four of 35 lymph nodes: 0/7 level IA, 0/4\nlevel IIB (see below), 1/8 level IIA, 2/8 level III, 1/5 level IV, 0/2 left facial, 0/1 level V. Foreign\nbody giant cell reaction within one of the level IIB nodes suggestive of reaction to necrotic\ntumor. Submandibular gland with no evidence of carcinoma. The largest positive node is 2.5 cm\n(level III) measured grossly. The three other positive nodes (level IIA, III, and IV) are\napproximately 1.5 cm, 1.2 cm and 1.1 cm based on microscopy. Both level III nodes and the\nlevel IIA node have extracapsular extension.",

A\nCLINICAL DATA: f 4' 45W)'c/q))3\n-year-old man with history of floor of mouth carcinoma (squamous cell\ncarcinoma).\nGROSS DESCRIPTION:\nA)Received in formalin designated \"left mandibular tumor\" is a composite\nresection specimen that includes an 11 x 8.5 cm ellipse of medium tan,\nhair-bearing skin with a central 2.5 cm in diameter ulcer and 8.5 cm in\ndiameter region of induration of the skin which extends focally to within 0.3\ncm of the anterior cutaneous margin. A smaller, 4 x 0.9 cm ellipse of skin\nis sutured to the main specimen at the left superior region. Partially\nembedded in the attached 12 x 8 x 6 cm aggregate of deep soft tissue and\nskeletal muscle is a portion of the mandible spanning from right anterior\npremolar region to body of the left mandible. Seven teeth, including a right\npremolar (with dental restoration), two incisors (one intact, one\nfractured/decayed), two canine teeth (intact), a portion of the first left\npremolar (fractured) and a premolar or molar with crown fractured or decayed\noff at the root. The diagonally transected mandibular cut surfaces appear\ngrossly unremarkable, consisting of cortical and cancellous bone. Left floor\nof mouth and the attached, approx. 2.5 x 3 cm portion of tongue are largely\nreplaced by an ill-defined, pale tan, firm, exo- and endophytic tumor mass\nthat has eroded through the mid-segment of the included left mandible (bone\nappears grossly essentially dissolved). Anteriorly, the skin and soft tissue\nis partially peeled off and sutured back on the mandible (this presumably\ndoes not represent a true surgical margin). The medial, right and anterior\nmargin is inked blue and the left lateral, inferior and posterior black.\nRepresentative sections are submitted as follows: Al - anterior midline\ncutaneous margin; A2 - left anterolateral; A3 - left posterior/inferior\ncutaneous; A4 - right inferior; A5 - right anteroinferior; A6 - right\ninferolateral; A7 - right superolateral cutaneous, A8 - right anteromedial\ngingival/tongue (shave margin, taken immediately posterior to transected\nright mandible); A9 - tongue and right (medial) margin; A10 - mid-medial\nmargin; All - posterior soft tissue, lateral aspect; A12 - posterior soft\ntissue, medial aspect. Bisection of the specimen across the extensively\neroded mandible now reveals a 3 cm diameter soft, red-brown, friable cavity\nand demonstrates that the firm, pale tan tissue grossly consistent with tumor\nextends essentially to the medial soft tissue margin, grossly. Submitted in\nA13 - region of destroyed mandible (mid-segment) and closest adjacent margin;\nA14 and A15 (decal) - mandible end margins. All margin sections are\nperpendicular unless stated otherwise.\nB)Received in formalin designated \"left neck level II\" is a 5 x 4 x 1 cm\naggregate of fibroadipose tissue containing multiple lymph nodes of up to 1.5\ncm in diameter. The largest node is bisected and submitted in cassette B1,\nthe remaining smaller nodes intact in B2.\nC)Received in formalin designated \"left neck level III\" is an 8 x 1.5 x\n0.8 cm strand of fibroadipose tissue containing multiple lymph nodes of up to\n1.0 cm diameter. All are submitted intact in cassette Cl. D)Received in formalin designated \"teeth\" are three teeth and six\nfragments of unoriented tooth material. The largest tooth, molar, measures\n1.8 x 1 x 0.7\ncm and has calculus material attached, and the neck of the tooth has dark\nbrown discoloration. The next largest tooth is a 2.2 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm incisor.\nIts crown appears to be a restoration of porcelain and silver-colored metal\ncrown. The root is discolored at the junction with the crown. The third is a\n2 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm incisor which appears intact. The remaining fragments of\ndentin, and tan-gray material range up to 0.7 cm in greatest dimension.\nFINAL DIAGNOSIS:\nA)Left mandible, composite resection:\n1.Squamous cell carcinoma, keratinizing, moderately to poorly\ndifferentiated\na.Size: est. at least 8 cm\nb.Involving floor of mouth, tongue, anterolateral skin (ulcerated) and\nparotid gland, and penetrating the mandible.\nc.Carcinoma present at margin of resection in left inferoposterior and\nright inferior subcutaneous soft tissue;\n- within 0.03 cm of (if not at) the right medial and left posterolateral\n(parotid region) soft tissue margin,\n- within 0.1-0.2 cm of medial posterior soft tissue,\n- other visualized margins clear by at least 0.3 cm.\n--Decalcification of the mandibular end margins is pending - see subsequent\naddendum.\nd.Perineural invasion present.\ne.Focally suspicious for angiolymphatic invasion.\n2.Chronic sialadenitis.\nB)Left level II, neck dissection: Squamous cell carcinoma present in one\nof 8 lymph nodes (1/8).\nC)Left level III, neck dissection: No carcinoma identified in 6 nodes\n(0/6).\nD)\"Teeth\", extraction: One molar, two incisor teeth, and multiple\nfragments of tooth material.

FISH test for RET/PTC rearrangement is pending.  \n      \nNOTE:   \nDNA was extracted in the amount sufficient for testing.  \n      \nBACKGROUND:  \nMutations in either BRAF or RAS genes or RET/PTC rearrangements are found in  \nmore than 70% of papillary thyroid carcinomas (1). BRAF V600E (T1799A)  \nmutation has been associat ed with more aggressive behavior of papillary  \ncarcinoma (2, 3).  The association between BRAF V600E mutation and features of  \ntumor aggressiveness have also been observed in papillary microcarcinomas (4).  \n Mutations in the RAS genes or PAX8/PPARg rearrangem ent occur in ~70% of  \nfollicular thyroid carcinomas and with lower frequency in oncocytic (H?rthle  \ncell) carcinomas (5). Regarding the specificity of these mutations for cancer,  \nBRAF V600E mutation and RET/PTC and PAX8/PPARg rearrangements are overall  \nspeci fic for malignancy in the thyroid, although they have been reported with  \na very low frequency in benign thyroid lesions (6).  RAS mutations occur in malignant and benign thyroid tumors, being found in  ~40- 50% of follicular  \nand anaplastic carcinomas, 30 -40% of follicular adenomas and 10- 15% of  \npapillary carcinomas (6).   \n1.  et al.

Specimens with the minimum of 50% of tumor cells in  \na microdissection target are accepted for the analysis. Optical density  \nreadings were obtained. Real -time PCR was perfor med on the LightCycler  \nplatform to amplify BRAF codons 599- 601, NRAS codon 61, HRAS codon 61, and  \nKRAS codons 12/13 sequences.  Post -PCR melting curve analysis was used to  \ndetect possible mutations. If required, the mutation type was confirmed by  \nSanger sequencing of the PCR product on ABI3130.  DNA from samples positive  \nfor each of these mutations was used as positive controls. Amplification at 35  \ncycles or earlier was considered sufficient for the analysis. The limit of  \ndetection is approximately 10 -20% of alleles with mutation present in the  \nbackground of normal DNA.  \n \n      \n     \n      \n          My signature is attestation that I have personally reviewed the submitted  \nmaterial(s) and the above diagnosis reflects that evaluation.  \nAddendum      \nIn-situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry have been performed on the  \ninvasive squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx in Part 3 and results are as  \nfollows:  \nSTAIN                  POSITIVE/NEGATIVE     HPV                    negative                 \nP16                    negative                \nEGFR                   3+                       \n                         My signature is attestation that I have personally reviewed the submitted  \nmaterial(s) and the above diagnosis reflects that evaluatio n. \n_______________________________________________________________  \nFINAL DIAGNOSIS:  \nPART 1: LYMPH NODES, NECK, LEVELS 2 - 4, SELECTIVE DISSECTION  \n     SEVENTEEN LYMPH NODES, NO TUMOR PRESENT (0/17).  \nPART 2: LYMPH NODES, RIGHT NECK, LEVELS 2 - 4 INCLUDING LEVEL 2B, SELECTIVE  \nDISSECTION  \nA.

The larger fragment measures 0.9 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm and the smaller fragment measures 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm. Microscopic description: The tumor is composed of cells arranged in cords and nests, with focal comedo necrosis. The tumor cells have high nucleus to cytoplasm ratio, vesicular chromatin, and conspicuous nucleoli. Mitotic figures are easily identified. Immunohistochemical stains show the tumor cells to be positive for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2 neu. The background shows extensive lymphocytic infiltration. No ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or invasive carcinoma is identified in the surrounding breast tissue.\n\n1. \"Site\": left breast. Justification: The report mentions a left breast mass and the biopsy was performed on the left breast.\n2. \"Laterality\": left. Justification: The tumor is located in the left breast, as stated in the report.\n3. \"Histology\": Invasive ductal carcinoma. Justification: The report mentions the tumor cells are arranged in cords and nests with focal comedo necrosis, consistent with invasive ductal carcinoma.\n4. \"Stage\": Not provided. Justification: The TNM stage cannot be determined from this report as it does not mention the size of the tumor, lymph node involvement, or metastasis.\n5. \"Grade\": Grade III (High grade or poorly differentiated). Justification: The tumor cells have high nucleus to cytoplasm ratio, vesicular chromatin, and conspicuous nucleoli with easily identified mitotic figures, all of which are features of a high-grade tumor.\n6. \"Behavior\": Malignant.

        "llm_output": " Site: The specimens are taken from various sites including floor of mouth, deep margin, medial margin, lateral margin, anterior margin, and anterior margin of mandible. This is necessary to examine the spread and severity of the disease in different regions.\n\nLaterality: The laterality is specified for some specimens as right or not provided. This helps in identifying the affected side of the body.\n\nHistology: Not all specimens provide information on histology, but Specimen 1 mentions a white/tan centrally located mass which may indicate a tumor. Histological examination is crucial for determining the type and nature of any abnormal growth or lesion.\n\nStage: The stage of the disease is not explicitly provided in these specimens. However, the extent of the surgical removal and number of lymph nodes examined can give an indication about the progression of the disease.\n\nGrade: Like the stage, the grade is also not directly given. But the size, shape, and appearance of the mass could provide clues about its malignancy potential which is a part of grade determination.\n\nBehavior: The behavior of the disease cannot be determined from these specimens alone as it requires clinical correlation and long-term follow up data. \n\nIn summary, while many details are provided in these specimens, critical information like definitive histology, stage, grade, and behavior are not fully available. These would typically be determined after further laboratory tests and clinical evaluation."

However, information about the stage is not provided in the report. Based on the presence of tumor involvement in multiple lymph nodes, it can be assumed that the cancer has spread beyond the primary site, indicating a more advanced stage. The grade of differentiation refers to how closely the cancer cells resemble normal tissue and is an indicator of how aggressive the cancer may be. Moderate differentiation indicates that the cancer cells are somewhat similar to normal tissue but still have some features that suggest they are abnormal. This is consistent with the diagnosis of moderately differentiated squamous carcinoma in the report. The behavior of this type of cancer is malignant, meaning it can invade nearby tissues and spread to other parts of the body."

        "llm_output": " Site: The site is not explicitly mentioned in the report, but based on the context, it appears to be a squamous non-keratinized carcinoma found in normal tissues (G3).\n\nLaterality: Laterality is not provided or discernible from the information given.\n\nHistology: The histological diagnosis is squamous non-keratinized carcinoma (G3). This type of cancer originates in the squamous cells that line the epithelium, and it has not yet formed keratin pearls.\n\nStage: The report does not provide information on the stage of the cancer. Staging requires knowledge of the size of the tumor, its spread to nearby lymph nodes or other organs, and the presence of any metastasis.\n\nGrade: The grade of the cancer is given as G3, which indicates a high-grade malignancy with significant cellular atypia, rapid growth, and a poor prognosis.\n\nBehavior: The behavior of this cancer is infiltrating or invasive since it has breached the normal tissue boundaries.\n\nJustification: These six categories are standard for oncological reporting and provide critical information for determining the appropriate treatment and prognosis."

The specimen consists of a partial mandibulectomy\nneasuring AP 4.4 x ML 3.1 x SI 2.3 cm. There is an exophytic papillary, and\nilcerated mass ,measuring AP 3.9 x 2.4 ML x SI 1.6. The mass is involving the\nnandible, extending into the gingiva proximally, and sulcus and buccal mucosa\nlistally. The mass is located at 0.6 cm from the deep resection margin, 0.6 cm\nrom the posterior resection margin, 0.2 cm from the anterior resection margin,\n1.2 cm from the medial (gingival/floor of mouth) resection margin, and 0.4 cm\nfrom the lateral (buccal) resection margin. The mandible measures AP 3.3 x SI\n.5 x ML 0.8 cm. All the margins are painted with silver nitrate. The deep\nnargin is painted green, and the circumferential (including anterior,\n\u25baosterior, and lateral/buccal areas )margins are painted black.

        "llm_output": " Site: Lower gingiva (gum) and lower alveolar process of the mandible\nLaterality: Left\nHistology: Squamous cell carcinoma, conventional type\nStage: pT2 pN1 (This stage is based on the 7th edition of AJCC/UICC TNM. The pathologic staging may change if bone invasion is found in decalcified sections.)\nGrade: Moderately differentiated (G2)\nBehavior: Malignant, as it is a cancer that can invade surrounding tissues and metastasize to other parts of the body.\n\nJustification: The site is identified as the lower gingiva and alveolar process of the mandible, laterality is specified as left. Histology reveals a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. The tumor size (pT2) is more than 2 cm but not more than 4 cm in greatest dimension, and there is metastasis in a single ipsilateral lymph node (pN1). However, the staging information is based on the 7th edition of AJCC/UICC TNM, and it may change if bone invasion is found in decalcified sections. The grade is G2, which means moderately differentiated. The behavior of this tumor is malignant, as it can invade surrounding tissues and metastasize to other parts of the body."

Received is an irregular portion of yellow  \nlobulated adipose  tissue consistent with a neck dissection, 7.5 x 5 x 1.5 cm.  \nThe specimen is subdivided into two equal parts.  Segment one (Level 1B) has 6 \npossible lymph nodes identified ranging in size from 0.2 to 1.5 cm with a  \nsalivary gland, 3.8 x 2.4 x 1.6 cm and a separate portion of similar glandular  \ntissue, 1.8 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm. The salivary gland on cut section has a light tan,  \nlobulated cut surface, without tumor.  The larger lymph nodes are hemorrhagic  \non cut section. Digital images of the glandular tissue are ta ken.  Segment two  \nhas two recognizable lymph nodes measuring 0.8 and 0.7 cm in greatest  \ndimension.  The smaller lymph node appears suspicious.  The lymph nodes and  \nsubmandibular gland are submitted in the following cassettes.  \nSection code:  \nSegment one  \n2A - two smallest possible lymph nodes  \n2B - 2E - bisected possible lymph nodes  \n2F - bisected smaller glandular tissue  \n2G - 2H - representative sections (90% submitted) of salivary gland  \nSegment two  \n2I - single possible lymph node  \n2J - single bisected possible  lymph node.  \nPart 3 is received fresh labeled with  the patient's name, initials xx  and \n\"right neck dissection level I\".  Received is an irregular portion of yellow  \nlobulated adipose tissue consistent with a neck dissection, 6.5 x 3.5 x 1.5  \ncm.  The specimen is subdivided into two equal parts. No lymph nodes are  \nidentified within segment one, however, a salivary gland, 4.2 x 2 x 1.6 cm, is  \nidentified. The salivary gland on cut section has a light tan, lobulated cut  \nsurface, without tumor. Digital images of t he glandular tissue are taken.  \nSegment two (Level 1A?) has 4 possible lymph nodes identified ranging in size  \nfrom 0.3 to 1.3 cm The largest lymph node is hemorrhagic on cut section.  The  \nlymph nodes and salivary gland are submitted in the following casset tes. \nSection code:  \nSegment one  \n3A - 3B - representative sections (80% submitted) of salivary gland  \nSegment two  \n3C - bisected lymph node  \n3D - 3 possible lymph nodes  \nPart 4 is received fresh labeled with  the patient's name, initials xx  and \n\"anterior composit e\".  Received is an anterior composite resection measuring 7  \nx 4.5 x 3.5 cm and consisting of anterior tongue, 4 x 6 x 2 cm, a marginal  \nanterior mandibulectomy, 6 x 1.1 x 1 cm, and floor of mouth soft tissue  \nincluding lacerated sublingual glands, overall, 3.5 x 2.5 x 1.1 cm.  A poorly  \ncircumscribed, firm, left and midline tumor 3.8 x 3.2 x 2.7 cm, involves the  \ninferior tongue and floor of mouth. It extends to within 0.7 cm of the  \ngingival/mandibular resection margin, and 0.8 cm from the deep tongue  \nresectio n margin.  The tumor is approximately 1 cm from the mandibular  \nhorizontal resection margin, approximately 0.7 cm from the left mandibular  \nresection margin and 0.6 cm from the right mandibular resection margin.  Tumor  \ninvolves the alveolar ridge and possibl y the mandibular cortical bone. Bone \nresection margins appear free of tumor.  No teeth are present. The sublingual  \nglands appear grossly unremarkable. Three frozen sections are performed with  \nintraoperative diagnoses completed.  Digital images are taken.

A surgical suture is attached to one aspect of the        specimen, which is consistent anatomically with the anterior aspect. The        overlying mucosal surface of the specimen is pink-tan, smooth, shiny, and       remarkable for an area of central ulceration measuring 1.5 x 1.0 cm. This       area of ulceration overlies a palpable, firm mass exhibiting approximate,       palpable dimensions of 2.5 cm from anterior to posterior x 2.0 cm from  medial to lateral x 1.5 cm from superior to inferior. The opposite surface      of the specimen is red-brown and focally cauterized. The specimen is inked      in the following manner: anterior orange, medial purple, posterior yellow,      lateral blue, and deep black. The specimen is serially sectioned from   anterior to posterior to reveal a heterogeneous, white-tan mass with focal      areas of hemorrhage present immediately inferior to the mucosal surface and     exhibiting maximal dimensions of 2.5 cm transversely x 1.3 cm in maximal        depth x 1.5 cm from anterior to posterior.

It consists of a strip of \nmucosa measuring 10.2 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm, marked with a stitch at the end (inked \ngreen).  \nThe specimen is entirely submitted after frozen section consultation in cassette 2AFS. \nPart 3 is received labeled with the patient' s name, initials xx, medical \nrecord number and \"bilateral neck dissection and laryngectomy\".  It \nconsists \nof a laryngectomy specimen with bilateral selective neck dissection, \nmeasuring 9.5 x 12.0 x 6.0 cm.   \nIt includes the epiglottis, thyroid and cricoid cartilages, potion of \ntrachea \nwith tracheostomy site measuring 1.2 x 1.0 cm.   \nThe attached hyoid bone measures 7.5 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm and appear unremarkable.   \nThe right thyroid gland lobe is identified, measuring 4.2 x 3.0 x 1.2 \ncm, \n9.0grams.   \nAn ulcerated tumor with firm rolled borders measuring 4.5 x 2.6 x 2.7 cm is \nidentified on the right pyriform sinus and appears to almost obstruct \nthe \nairway.  It is located 1.5 cm from the epiglottis, 0.4 cm from the \nclosest \nleft mucosal pharyngeal specimen edge, 0.3 cm from the closest right \npharyngeal specimen edge, 3.3 cm from tracheal margins, and 0.4 cm from \nthe \nanterior soft tissue margins (inked blue). \nOn sectioning the tumor is tan- white, lobulated, firm with involvement \nof \nbilateral aryepiglottic folds.  It appears to compress the right \nepiglottic \nfold. The vocal cords appear uninvolved by the tumor. Tumor is less \nthan 0.5 \n cm from the thyroid cartilage grossly.  The soft tissue and the thyroid \ngland \nshow no involvement by tumor.  The mass appears to push through the \nmucosa 1.0 \ncm above the right false vocal cord with nodule formation measuring \n0.3cm.   The right lobe of thyroid gland parenchyma appears firm, brown with no \ngross \nlesions.   \nThe right selective neck dissection is composed of fibroadipose tissue with portion of skeletal muscle.

Site: The tumor is located in the oral cavity, specifically in the right retromolar trigone. This is based on the \"Specimen Type\" and \"Tumor Site\" sections of the report.\n2. Laterality: The tumor is located on the right side of the oral cavity. This is based on the \"Specimen Type\" section of the report.\n3. Histology: The tumor is a squamous cell carcinoma, conventional type. This is based on the \"Histologic Type\" section of the report.\n4. Stage: The tumor is at stage pT3 pN2b, which indicates that the primary tumor is larger than 4 cm and has spread to 2-4 regional lymph nodes. This is based on the \"Pathologic Staging (pTNM)\" section of the report.\n5. Grade: The tumor is grade G2, indicating moderate differentiation. This is based on the \"Histologic Grade\" section of the report.\n6. Behavior: The tumor is malignant, as it is a cancerous growth. This is implied throughout the report.\n\nJustification for choice: These six categories are commonly used in pathology reports to describe the characteristics and extent of a tumor. They provide important information for determining the appropriate treatment and prognosis.

There are no orientation instructionsreceived along with the specimen. The specimen consists of a grosslyidentifiable tongue with a pink-tan, shaggy mucosal surface which measures10.5 cm from anterior to posterior by 6.5 cm from right to left byapproximately 3.5 cm superior to inferior. There is a small amount ofadjacent pink-tan, shiny mucosa, which is consistent with the floor of themouth. The surface of the specimen opposite the mucosa is pink-red, shaggy,and consistent with a surgical resection margin. Using anatomic landmarksfor orientation, the specimen has been inked in the following manner:anterior is orange, posterior is black, right is red, left is yellow, andinferior is green. The mucosal surface is notable for an ulcerated, friablemass that is present on the right floor of mouth, extending to the lateralaspect of the tongue and measures approximately 7.5 x 5.0 cm in area.Grossly, the mass extends to within 1.0 cm of the right lateral margin and1.5 cm of the anterior margin.

A is additionally designated left radical tonsil and tongue base resection. The specimen consists of a TO x 5.5 x 2.7 cm gray purple soft tissue that is\nsurfaced by a pink tan mucosa to include tonsil and small portion of base of tongue. There is some ink by the pathologist at the time of intraoperative\nconsult for orientation. No frozen was done. The lateral aspect is yellow. The superior aspect is blue. The inferior aspect is green and the medial\naspect is red. The deep surface is black. The inferior aspect of the specimen corresponds with the Lase of tongue,In the mucosal surface is a 4.3 x3.5 cm red tan fungating mass .The mass is abutting the inferior aspect of the tonsil and 2.5 cm from the superior mucosal margin, 0.5 cm to thr nearest\nlateral mucosal margin, 0.8 cm from the nearest inferie mucosal margin and 0.2 cm from toe newest medial mucosal margin (near the inferioraspect).The specimen is serially sectioned from superior to inferior to reveal the mass has a third dimension of 2.3 cm and is 0.1 cm from the nearest deep\nmargin. This is abutting the deep margin on the medial aspect of the specimen. The mass also appears to be involvingthe skeletal muscle of the base\nof the tongue. The uninvolved tonsil is pink tan to white tan with a 1.5 cm cyst filled with a purulent material This is adjacent to the mass.\nRepresentative sections are submitted in cassettes Al-A8 as follows: Al-mass to medial mucosa and soft tissue margin: A2--mass to lateral mucosa\nand soft tissue margin; A3-superior mucosal margin shaved and submitted inked down: A4-mass to the inferior mucosa and soft tissue margin, A5-\nmass to deep ;A6-additional mass to deep; A7-mass involving the base of tongue: A8--tonsillar cyst.

The absence of bone invasion supports this staging. Additionally, the workup includes multiple sections of the mass and surrounding tissues, including the maxillary bone following decalcification, indicating a malignant process. For levels 1 to 4 in the left neck, the presence of lymph nodes with fatty cut surfaces suggests no obvious metastasis, but further examination is needed for a complete assessment."

Today: Left neck\ndissection, oral lesion excision (buccal), radial forearm free flap.\nGROSS DESCRIPTION:\nA)Received in formalin designated \"..., left level IB\" is a 4 x 4 x\n2.5 cm yellow lobulated portion of fibrofatty tissue. The specimen is\nsectioned and there is an eccentric 4 cm in greatest dimension salivary gland\nidentified. It has tan lobulated cut surfaces. No masses or lesions are\nidentified. Surrounding the salivary gland is a scant amount of adipose\ntissue admixed with three lymph nodes ranging from 0.8 to 1.4 cm in greatest\ndimension. The lymph nodes are sectioned and have focally white indurated\ncut surfaces. Representative sections are submitted as follows: Al - two\nbisected lymph nodes, one inked blue and one inked orange; A2 - one trisected\nlymph node; A3-A4 - random salivary gland.\nB)Received in formalin designated \"..., left level II and III\" is a 8 x 3 x\n2 cm yellow lobulated portion of fibrofatty tissue. There are two sutures\nattached to the level II region and three sutures to the level III region.\nThe specimen is sectioned and has yellow lobulated fatty focally fibrous cut\nsurfaces admixed with numerous lymph nodes ranging from 0.1 to 1.5 cm. No\nmasses are identified. The larger lymph nodes are sectioned and have\nunremarkable cut surfaces. Representative sections are submitted as follows:\nB1-B3 - candidate level II lymph nodes; B4 - two bisected level II lymph\nnodes, one inked blue and one inked orange; B5-B6- candidate level II lymph\nnodes; B7 - two bisected level II lymph nodes, one inked blue and one inked\norange; B8 - candidate level III lymph nodes.\nC)Received fresh designated \"..., gingival mucosa\" are two fragments of\ntissue measuring 0.2 and 0.3 cm in greatest dimension, which is entirely\nsubmitted for frozen section diagnosis, then thawed and submitted in cassette\nCFS 1 .\nD)Received in formalin designated \"..., left buccal mass\" is a 4.5 x 3.7 x\n2.5 cm portion of tan and brown tissue. The mucosal surface is remarkable\nfor a 3.6 x 2.6 cm exophytic, pale tan lesion with adherent blood on the\nsurface that is raised 1.2 cm above the adjacent mucosa. There is smooth,\nglistening, gray-brown mucosa around three of the four sides of this lesion;\nhowever, the lesion abuts the fourth side and appears transected. The deep\nsurface has fibrofatty tissue with no gross tumor. No orientation is\nprovided to the specimen; however, the side where the lesion abuts the margin\nis inked black and arbitrarily designated 3 o'clock. The 12 o'clock aspect\nis inked blue, 9 o'clock orange, and 6 o'clock green. The specimen is\nserially sectioned from 12-6 o'clock, revealing a 2.6 cm (from 3-9) x 1.6 cm\n(from superficial to deep) x 4.5 cm 12-6 o'clock lesion that is white on cut\nsurface. This lesion abuts the black ink, appears free of the deep aspect by\nat least 0.5 cm, and appears to approach the orange ink. The 12 and 6\no'clock most slices are sectioned perpendicularly to these margins, revealing\napproximately 0.4 cm of normal mucosa between the lesion and the green inked\nmargin, and 0.6 cm of normal mucosa between the lesion and the blue inked\nmargin. Cassettes: D1-D2 - composite of lesion from 9-3 o'clock; D3 -\nadditional representative section in relationship to black ink; D4 - additional representative section in relationship to orange ink; D5 -\nsections in relationship to blue ink; D6 - representative sections in\nrelationship to green ink.\nE)Received fresh designated \"..., superior buccal margin\" are two\npieces of tan tissue measuring 0.2 and 0.5 cm in greatest dimension, which\nare inked black and submitted entirely for frozen section diagnosis, and then\nthawed and submitted in cassette E/F/GFS1.\nF)Received fresh designated inferior buccal margin\" is a 0.7 x 0.2 x\n0.3 cm portion of tan and red tissue, which is inked blue and submitted\nentirely for frozen section diagnosis, then thawed and submitted in cassette\nE/F/GFS1.\nG)Received fresh designated tongue margin\" is a 0.8 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm\nportion of tan and red tissue, which is inked orange and submitted entirely\nfor frozen section diagnosis, then thawed and submitted in cassette E/F/GFS1.\nH)Received in formalin designated \"..., left molar left posterior\nmargin\" is a 2 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm premolar.

A thorough lymph node dissection was      performed and multiple candidate lymph nodes were identified. The largest       lymph node appears to be matted to another lymph node and this matted   aggregate measures 4.7 x 1.5 x 2.0 cm. The remaining candidate lymph nodes      range in size from 1.0 cm to 2.2 cm in greatest dimension. The lymph nodes      are bisected and submitted in entirety. Summary of sections: 1A-1B, largest lymph node bisected, 1/1 each; 1C, 3        candidate lymph nodes, 3/1; 1D, 3 candidate lymph nodes, 3/1; 1E, 5     candidate lymph nodes, 5/1.             2) SOURCE: Right Tongue         Received fresh in a container labeled with the patient's name and MR name       and \"right tongue-stitch anterior\". The specimen consists of a  hemiglossectomy specimen measuring 8.9 x 5.0 x 4.8 cm in greatest       dimension. The lateral surface shows exposed ulcerated tumor measuring 6.1      x 2.9 cm. This section of the tumor abuts the mucosal surface. The surface      of the tongue has two nodular-like lesions present midway moving towards        the posterior surface. These nodules are white and hard with petechial  \n markings. These two nodules measure 1.2 x 1.0 x 0.3 cm and 0.8 x 0.5 x 0.2      \ncm. A stitch is present marking the anterior surface of the tongue and was      \nplaced by the surgeon. The medial margin is inked black, the posterior  margin inked blue and the inferior margin is inked orange. The medial   surface shows muscle and no obvious tumor. Both the posterior and the   inferior surface show soft tissue that does not resemble tumor. The tongue      is serially sectioned from anterior to posterior revealing two large hard       white nodules that are hemorrhagic and ulcerated in appearance. These   nodules measure 3.0 x 2.2 cm and 2.0 x 1.9 cm. The second nodule appears to     extend down from the two surface nodules that are present on the surface of     the tongue. The mass appears to abut the medial margin. Also present in the     container is a small piece of detached skeletal muscle tissue measuring 3.3     x 1.4 x 1.0 cm.
