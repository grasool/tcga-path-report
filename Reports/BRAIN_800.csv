SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 
1. Right insular tumor: astrocytoma with mitotic activity. see 
comment. 
2. Right insular tumor: astrocytoma with mitotic activity. see 
comment. 
Comment:  TCGA-CS-4942 
The tumor in specimens #1 and #2 contains fibrillary astrocytoma 
composed of moderately pleomorphic fibrillary astrocytes. Rare but 
multiple mitoses are present in both specimens #1 and #2. Two mitotic 
f; ·1res are identified in specimen #1 (slide 18) and two mitotic 
tol:1ures are identified in specimen #2 (slide 28). The proliferation 
index as determined by Ki67 (MI8-1) staining is greater than 5% in 
small foci of specimen #2 (slide 2A). The identification of rare 
mitoses and a focally elevated proliferation index suggest that this 
astrocytic tumor is an astrocytoma (WHO grade II) in the process of 
transformation to a higher grade tumor or that these tumor biopsies are 
from a higher grade tumor. Clinical correlation recommended.

Page 2 of 3
TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT promoter have been shown to
benefit
from therapy with alkylating agents .Assessment of MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite
treatment of
DNA followed by real-time PCR amplification of methylated and unmethylated DNA
sequences. The
analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by serial dilution of methylated positive control DNA into
unmethylated DNA, and was assessed to be 1 % of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated
DNA. Factors
such as the presence of >50% non-neoplastic cells in the sample, or extensive tissue necrosis, may
preclude the
detection of methylated MGMT promoter sequences.
FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a stand alone diagnostic
test. This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the
as required
by CLIA ' 88 regulations .Ithas not been cleared or approved for specific uses by the U. S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA). The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
IMMUNOHI STOCHEMISTRY: The GFAP demonstrates a glial fibrillary background.
About 25% of the neoplastic cells over express the p53 protein. With the
MIB-1, there is a proliferation index of about 14% in the more active areas.
These immuno features support the diagnosis of high histological grade
astrocytoma.

Microscopy:
Histological sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin showed fragments of
neocortex with diffuse infiltration by low-grade glial neoplasm ,mainly located in the
white matter, which consists of distinct phenotype cells, which present interspersed
among themselves.
The predominant cell pattern is represented by rounded cell nuclei with delicate and
granular chromatin ,with inconspicuous nucleoli .The cytoplasm is scarce, with
imprecise limits. It can be observed in some areas ,the presence of perinuclear halos.
These cells infiltrate the adjacent cortex ,committing up to layer I ,with frequent neuronal
sattelitosis.
The other cell component ,with lesser quantity of cells is represented by irregular and
sometimes elongated nuclei ,with dense chromatin and eosinophilic cytoplasm with
imprecise limits.
The tumor shows areas with increased cellularity ,inwhich the neuropil displays
rarefaction and eventual microcysts .Mitotic figures are rare .Itwas not observed
vessels with microvascular proliferation and / or necrotic foci.
PER-OPERATIVE
Smears show ,insent fragments ,diffuse low-grade glial neoplasm ,consisting of
elongated nuclei cells with mild dyskaryosis in a rich fibrillar plot .It is note also some
round nuclei cells .There are some eosinophilic and amorphous structures ,suggesting
Rosenthal fibers ,but not conclusive.
Conclusion :Low-grade glioma ,in this material.
Diagnosis:
Resection product of brain lesion in the left temporal region:
-Oligoastrocitoma ,grade IIWHO (ICD-O 9382/3).
NOTE:
-The oligodendroglial component is predominant in this material.
Award of 1 p/1 9q deletion analysis: The hybridizations were performed on 5 micrometers thick sections of formalin-fixed
and paraffin-embedded neoplastic tissue (FFPE) in the most representative tumor area
with Ip36/1g25 and 19g13/19p13 probe. 100 to 200 were evaluated in each
slide cores.
In this case: The ratio of signals from 1p/1q probes was 0 ,58. The ratio of signals from
19q/19p probes was 0,62. Conclusion: Diffuse oligoastrocitoma grade IIWHO with co-
deletion of 1p/19q.

PATHOLOGICAl, IlIAGNOSIS: 
A and B. Brain, left temporal parietal f exci~_lional biopsies and 
resection: 
Anaplastic astrocytOifia. MIB--l proliferation index: 15%. 
See commp.nt. 
COMMENT 
Specimen A is small fragments of a glial neoplastic proliferation with 
nuclear 
anaplasia and mitotic figures sprinkled throughout the tumor. 
Specimen B is 
large fragments of brain infiltrated and effaced by a similar glial 
proliferation with an astrocyte phenotype, marked nuclear anaplasia, 
and brisk 
mitotic activity. 
The MIB-l proliferation index is about 15%. There is focal (cortical) 
microvascular calcification, but microvascular cellular proliferation 
and 
necrosis are inconspicuous. 
The morphological findings are interpreted as an anaplastic glioma,  predominantly astrocytoma, with perhaps a minor oligodendroglial 
component 
(part A).

_'ain, right cerebral tumor, excision: Gliosarcoma with ependymal 
differentiation (comment). 
COMMENT He has a 
uid level and 
The Ki-67 labeling index is up to approximately 75% within the nodules. p53 
staining is negative. 
The MGMT promoter methylation assay is negative (see below). There is evidence 
of Ip deletion (see below). 
Three cases of gliosarcoma thought to arise in an ependymoma (2 after 
treatment) have been published. Since osteoid and cartilage can occur in 
posterior fossa ependymomas, it is possible that this tumor may show some 
biological overlap with anaplastic ependymoma.

Interpretation 
Findings are suggestive of allelic loss on chromosome arm lp. 
There is no evidence of allelic loss on chromosome arm 19q . 
• formative loci are: D1S552, D1S468, D1S1612, D19S412, PLA2G4C, D19S606, 
D19S1182 
Results-Comments 
Testing performed on tumor paraffin block  (31) and peripheral blood 
for germline comparison. 
TEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA 
(baseline)/ Tumor DNA pairs using 3 markers at both 1p and 19q. The 3 markers 
on 1p are D1S548, 0181592, and D1S552 (with D1S468, D181612, and D1S496 as 
backup markers) and the 3 markers on 19q are D19S219, D19S412, and PLA2G4C 
(with D19S606 and D19S1182 as backup). All markers are rnicrosatellites (2 or 4 
nt repeats) except PLA2G4C which is a minisatellite (26 nt repeat) 
polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score, 
amplicon size, .and ease of interpretation. The backup markers are used if .the 
first line markers at that chromosome arm are uninformative or otherwise 
ambiguous in their interpretation. LOR at all informative loci on each 
chromosomal arm represents the typical finding in oligodendrogliomas with Ip 
and 19q deletion.

'~e context of established procedures and/or diagnostic criteria. 
TECHNICAL SENSITIVITY: The presence of >15% non-neoplastic cells in the sample 
may preclude the detection of allelic loss.

 PRINCIPLE: Among the major subtypes of gliomas, oligodendrogliomas are 
istinguished by their remarkable sensitivity to chemotherapy, with 
approximately 70% of anaplastic (malignant) oligodendrogliomas responding 
dramatically t azine, lornustine, and vincristine 
(termed PCV) ( Unfortunately, no clinical or 
pathologic feature allows accurate prediction of chemotherapeutic response. 
Oligodendrogliomas are also associated with a longer average patient survival 
as compared to astrocytic tumors. However, the histologic distinction between 
oligodendroglioma and astrocytoma is often highly subjective, and there has 
been significant interobserver variation.

statistically significant and currently the best predictor of chemosensitivity 
combined loss involving chromosome arms Ip and 19q predicts both 
chemotherapeutic response and longer survival in patients with oligodendrogliomas

oligodendroglial tumors and in only 10% of astrocytomas)

2. Negative for co -deletion of chromosomal arms 1 p and 19q
3. Positive for mutant IDHI -RI 32H protein by immunostain g 124 /13
See comment.
Comment
The portions of cerebrum are diffusely infiltrated and focally effaced by a glial neoplastic proliferation. In
part A, the
non-enhancing tumor is diffusely infiltrative, and sparsely to moderately cellular. In part B, the tumor tends
to be more
solid, with hypercellular areas .The infiltrating cells have oval to elongated and spindle-shaped nuclei. The
immunostain for the mutant IDH1-R132H protein is diffusely positive. There are foci with brisk mitotic
activity and the
Ki-671 MIB-1 proliferation index is up to approximately 13% in the most active areas . Foci of
microvascular
proliferation are also identified, highlighted by the CD34 immunostain and in negative relief by the GFAP
immunostain. There is no tumor necrosis seen in these sections.
Overall, this high histological grade diffuse glioma is most consistent with glioblastoma, WHO grade 4.

TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT promoter have been shown to
benefit from therapy with alkylating agents .Assessment of MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfate
treatment of
DNA followed by real-time PCR amplification of methylated and unmethylated DNA
sequences. The
analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by serial dilution of methylated positive control DNA into
unmethylated DNA, and was assessed to be 1% of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated

such as the presence of >50 % non- neoplastic cells in the sample, or extensive tissue necrosis, may
preclude the
detection of methylated MGMT promoter sequences.

PCR for EGFR ~utation 
Date Ordered: IIIIIIIIIIIII Date Reported: 
Interpretation 
NEGATIVE -No evidence of EGFRvIII mutation is detected 
Results-Comments 
TEST DESCRIPTION: Testing performed on RNA extracted from tissue block 
H slide was examined and no microdissection was 
needed. 
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an attractive molecular 
target 
in glioblastoma because it is amplified/ overexpressed/ and/or mutated 
in·up 
to ""40%"" to 50% of patients. Epidermal growth factor receptor variant 
III 
(EGFRvIII) is an oncogenic, constitutively active mutant form of EGFR 
that is 
commonly expressed in glioblastoma. Cell culture and in vivo models of 
glioblastoma have demonstrated EGFRvIII as defining prognostically 
distinct 
sub~roups of ·""glioblastomas. Additionally I the presence of EGFRvIII has 
been 
shown to sensitize tumors to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors when the 
tumor 
suppressor protein PTEN is intact. RNA is extracted from formalin 
fixed, 
paraffin embedded tissue samples and reverse transcribed to cDNA. The 
cDNA is 
then amplified using standard PCR technique for DNA templates. PCR 
products 
are detected by gel electrophoresis. The limit of detection of this 
assay has 
been determined to be approximately 5 mutant cells in 100 normal 
cells.

Results-Comments 
Testing performed on DNA extracted from microdissected tumor paraffin 
block 
TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT 
promoter 
have been shown to benefit from therapy with alkylating agents. 
Assessment of 
MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite treatment of DNA 
followed 
by real-time PCR amplification (MethyLight) of methylated and 
unmethylated DNA 
·sequences. The analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by 
serial 
dilution of methylated positive control DNA into unmethylated DNA, and 
was 
assessed to be 1% of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated 
DNA .. 
Factors such as the presence of >50% non-neoplastic cells in the 
sample, or 
extensive tissue necrosis, may preclude the detection of methylated 
MGMT

All specimens show similar features and will be described together. 
Sections 
show a high-grade glioma demonstrating mitotic activity, microvascular 
proliferation and geographic necrosis. Many cells have round nuclei 
very much 
resembling an oligodendroglioma. Other cells aie more astrocyte- or 
gemistocytic astrocyte-like in appearance. Some cells are intermediate 
between 
mini-gemistocytes and classic gemistocytes. Hermelin slides are also 
examined 
and show some mucin pools. The tumor is diffusely p53 positive and the 
Ki-67 
labeling index is up to approximately 30%. Positive and negative 
controls show 
appropriate immunoreactivity. -.. -··-· .

Loss of Heterozygosity 1p, 19q Assay (LOH) 
Date Ordered:  Date Reported: 
 Interpretation 
POSITIVE: Allelic loss on chromosome arm 19q is detected. 
No deletion of chromosome arm lp seen. 
Informative loci are: D1S548, D1S1592, D1S552, D19S219, and PLA2G4C 
Results-Comments 
Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block. 
DNA extracted from a corresponding blood specimen was used as normal 
reference 
control. 
H slide was examined and no microdissection was 
needed. 
TEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA 
(baseline)/ Tumor DNA pairs using 3 markers at both 1p and 19q. The 3 
markers 
on 1p are D1S548, D1S1592, and D1S552 (with D1S468, D1S1612, and 
D1S496 as 
backup markers) and the 3 markers on 19q are D19S219, D19S412, and 
PLA2G4C 
(with D19S606 and D19S1182 as backup) . All markers are microsatellites 
(2 or 4 
nt repeats) except PLA2G4C which is a minisatellite (26 nt repeat) 
polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score, 
amplicon size, and ease of interpretation. The backup markers are used 
if the 
first line markers at that chromosome arm are uninformative or 
otherwise 
ambiguous in their interpretation. LOH at all informative loci on each 
chromosomal arm represents the typical finding in oligodendrogliomas 
\iith 1p 
and 19q deletion.

TEST DESCRIPTION: Testing performed on RNA extracted from paraffin 
tissue 
block 
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an attractive molecular 
target 
in glioblastoma because it is amplified, overexpressed, and/or mutated 
in up 
to 40% to 50% of patients. Epidermal growth factor receptor variant 
III 
(EGFRviii) is an oncogenic, constitutively active mutant form of EGFR 
that is 
commonly expressed in glioblastoma. Cell culture and in vivo models of 
glioblastoma have demonstrated EGFRviii as defining prognostically 
distinct 
subgroups of glioblastomas. Additionally, the presence of EGFRviii has 
been 
shown to sensitize tumors to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors when the 
tumor 
suppressor protein PTEN is intact. RNA is extracted from formalin 
fixed, 
paraffin embedded tissue samples and reverse transcribed to eDNA. The 
eDNA is 
then amplified using standard PCR technique for DNA templates. PCR 
products 
are detected by gel electrophoresis. The limit of detection of this 
assay has 
been determined to be approximately 5 mutant cells in 100 normal 
cells. 
FDA Comment: The above data are not to be construed as the results 
from a 
stand alone diagnostic test. This test was deve~oped and its 
performance

TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT 
promoter 
have been shown to benefit from therapy with alkylating agents. 
Assessment of 
MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite treatment of DNA 
foll011ed 
by real-time PCR amplification (MethyLight) of methylated and 
unmethylated DNA 
sequences. The analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by 
serial 
dilution of methylated positive control DNA into unmethylated DNA, and 
was 
assessed to be 1% of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated 
DNA. 
Factors such as the presence of >50% non-neoplastic cells in the

extensive tissue necrosis, may preclude the detection of methylated 
MGMT 
promoter sequences.

icroscopic  
 
Permanent section of frozen section demonstrates mildly hypercellular white matter.  The hypercellularity appears due to cells with mildly atypical angular nuclei with out apparent processes.  No mitotic figures are seen.  There is no 
microvascular proliferation or necrosis  
  Addendum  
 Sections demonstrate a modestly cellular glial neoplasm, a dense glial fibrillary stroma.  The tumor cells tend to be modestly clustered and sometimes oriented around vessels but well formed pseudorosettes are not seen.  There is no myxoid or microcystic change and no calcifications are present.  Nuclei are consistently round with modest atypia.  No mitotic figures are seen.  
 The neoplastic cells are diffusely immunoreactive for GFAP as is the fibrillary 
background.  There is no punctate cytoplasmic standing for EMA, strong evidence against ependymal or subependymal lineage.  Neurofilament stain demonstrates a gradation from normally filamentous at the periphery to only rare neurofilament posit ive axons centrally.  Nevertheless, this pattern does suggest 
an infiltrative process.  MIB -1 demonstrates only a very rare positive cell with an 
estimated labeling index of less than 0.1%.  Overall, this immunophenotype confirms the histologic impression of a very low grade but diffusely infiltrating 
astrocytic neoplasm

 Microscopic  
 Sections demonstrate a glial neoplasm that diffusely infiltrates both gray and white matter.  In the gray matter, there is prominent perineuronal satellitosis as well as subpial surface spread. Tumor cells have round nuclei with few apparent cytoplasmic processes.  Many demonstrate perinuclear halos.  There is little cytologic atypia.  No mitotic figures are seen.  There is no microvascular proliferation or necrosis.  
.  Addendum discussion : 
 Numerous MIB -1 reactive cells are present throughout the specimen.  A labeling index of 21% is 
calculated.  This is indicative of a markedly proliferative glial neoplasm.  Despite this, no mitotic figures are identified on the  stain and only a rare mitotic figure was indentified on the immunohistochemistry.  Consequently, the tumor must be classified as low grade/grade II. Nevertheless, the very high MIB -1 labeling index suggests more aggressive behavior.  Close 
clinical follow -up is indicated . 
 Final Addendum Diagnosis:  
 Oligodendroglioma, low grade, WHO grade II  
"," 1. ""Site"": The site is the brain, as the report specifically states that the sample is a glial neoplasm, which is a type of brain tumor.

COMMENT The specimens contain portions of a neoplastic proliferation of small glial 
cells, with nuclear anaplasia, mitotic figures, a very high proliferation 
index, microvascular cellular proliferation and necrosis, and zones of tumor 
necrosis with pseudopalisading. There are zones of hemorrhage, with prominent 
thrombosis of vessels. 
The phenotype of this high histological grade glioma (WHO grade IV) is 
predominantly astrocytic. These small cell glioblastomas are difficult to tell apart from malignant oligodendrogliomas. Determining the LOH status of 
this patient may better characterize the neoplasm.

1p, 19q LOH ( codeletion ):Positive.

Methylated MGMT: Positive.
MIB-1 proliferation index :Up to 6%.
See Microscopy Description and Comment.
Comment
The sections contain portions of cerebrum that are focally slight to moderately infiltrated by a glial
neoplastic
proliferation that has an oligodendroglial phenotype. There is one proliferation center where there is
mitotic activity
and a MIB-1 proliferation index of 6%; the proliferation index elsewhere is up to about 2%. There is not
endothelial
cell proliferation, microvascular cellular proliferation or tumor necrosis.
The neoplasm overall is a low histological grade oligodendroglioma (WHO 2). There is a proliferation
center in which
there is a moderately heightened mitotic and cycling activity. As an isolated finding the meaning of these
proliferation
centers is uncertain. They are not enough for upgrading the neoplasm; but may portend enhanced
biological activity,
and may perhaps be precursors of transformation.
The morphological features of this tumor may be correlated with clinical, imaging, and operative findings
for their
interpretation and patient's follow up.

Loss of Heterozygosity 1 p, 19q Assay (LOH) Date Ordered : Date Reported:
Interpretation
POSITIVE: Allelic loss on chromosome arm 1 p and chromosome arm 19q is detected.
Informative loci are :D1 S548 ,D1 S1592 ,D1 S552 ,D19S1182
Results -Comments
Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block DNA extracted from a
corresponding
blood specimen was used as a normal reference control.
Only one of 5 loci on chromosome 19q is informative .Based on LOH at DI 9S1182 , LOH of 1 p and
morphology of
oligodendroglioma ,findings are consistent with deletion of 19q as well. Clinical and morphologic
correlation is
recommended.
TEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA (baseline )/ Tumor DNA
pairs using 3
markers at both 1 p and 19q. The 3 markers on 1 p are D1 S548, D1 S1592 ,and D1 S552 (with D1 S468,
D1 S1612, and
D1S496 as backup markers )and the 3 markers on 19q are D19S219 ,D19S412 , and PLA2G4C (with
D19S606 and
D19SI 182 as backup). All markers are microsatellites (2 or 4 nt repeats )except PLA2G4C which is a
minisatellite (26
nt repeat )polymorphism .The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score, amplicon size, and
ease of
interpretation .The backup markers are used if the first line markers at that chromosome arm are
uninformative or
otherwise ambiguous in their interpretation .LOH at all informative loci on each chromosomal arm
represents the
typical finding in oligodendrogliomas with 1 p and 19q deletion.

TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT promoter have been shown to
benefit
from therapy with alkylating agents .Assessment of MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite
treatment of DNA followed by real-time PCR amplification of methylated and unmethylated DNA
sequences. The
analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by serial dilution of methylated positive control DNA into
unmethylated DNA, and was assessed to be 11 %of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated
DNA. Factors
such as the presence of >50 %non-neoplastic cells in the sample ,or extensive tissue necrosis, may
preclude the
detection of methylated MGMT promoter sequences.

Addendum Discussion:  
Only a rare MIB -1 positive cell is present, consistent with the low grade histologic 
features. The case is reviewed with who in addition to the astrocytic proliferation, notes disorganiza tion of neurons with some atpyia, as well as neurons and 
white matter, consistent with a background of cortical dysplasia.  
 
Addendum Diagnosis:  
Well- differentiated Astrocytoma, grade II in background of cortical dysplasia.  
 
Microscopic Description:  
Secti ons demonstrate a mildly to moderately hypercellular glial neoplasm that diffusely 
infiltrates white matter as well as gray matter. In the latter, focal perineuronal satellitosis is seen. The tumor predominantly resemble s gemistocytes, although some 
fibrillary astrocytes are seen. Although the nuclei tend to be round to oval, perinuclear halos or other definite indications of oligodendroglioma differentiation are not seen. Atypia is mild to moderate. No mitoses are in seen in 50 high power fields or on lower power scanning.

Comment: The histological profile and Ki-67 labelling index are consistent
with a low grade (WHO grade II) glial neoplasm. Though in many areas the
cells assume an oligodendroglial profile, in other areas more pleomorphic
elements with astrocytic appearance are present. More sections as well as
assays for Ip/19q deletions are pending and an addendum will be issued

The resultant FISH section/slide is scanned by a trained licensed
medical technologist and analyzed using a FDA-approved, validated
semi-automated scanning imaging workstation and accompanying imaginglocus of interest.
Number of Observers:
Test Interpreted By:
Comments analysis software .The resultant FISH section/slide is then
presented to the interpreting Pathologist, who will reviews the FISH
results from and compares them to the results manually observed
under Fluorescence Microscope. Therefore the ratio is enumerated
by computer-aided counting as well as manual counting.
Interpretation of Test
The ratio for probe set 1 is derived by dividing the total number of
1p36 signals by the total number of 1g25 signals in at least 20
interphase nuclei with
nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic glial cells. Cells with no
signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. The ratio for
probe set 2 is derived by dividing the total number of 19q13 signals by
the total number of 19p13 signals in at least 2 sets of 20 interphase
nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic glial cells at two
different areas of the sample. Cells with no signals or with signals of
only one color are disregarded. References ranges for our laboratory for
allelic loss versus no allelic loss were established by evaluating both
probe sets in a series of 40 normal cases from 10 different organs. For
both probe set 1 and 2 a ratio of less than 0.80 taken from at least 2 sets
of 20 interphase nuclei at 2 different areas with nonoverlapping nuclei is
consistent with allelic loss.

PATHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS: A and B. Brain, right parietal, excision: Glioblastoma. MIB-l proliferation 
index: 12%. See Microscopy Description and Comment. 
COMMENT The sections contain portions of an astrocytic neoplastic proliferation that 
infiltrates and extensively effaces the cerebrum. The neoplasm is 
small-celled, and has nuclear anaplastic features, mitotic figures, 
microvascular proliferation with vascular necrosis and thrombosis, and small 
zones of tumor necrosis. The neurons contained within the neoplasm are 
interpreted as non-neoplastic native neurons, and a neuronal component is 
considered unlikely.

amount of attached dark red clotted blood aggregating to 4 x 2 x 1 cm. 
SECTIONS: B1-B3 entirely submitted. 
MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY: The GFAP demonstrates glial fibrillogenesis by the 
neoplastic cells. There are non-atypical neuronal elements (positive with 
synaptophysin, chromogranin, and NeuN) focally, in what appears to be cerebral 
cortex. With the MIB-1 there is a proliferation index of about 12% throughout 
the tumor. SPECIAL STAIN: There is no reticulin deposition within the neoplasm. 
The findings are consistent with a high histological grade astrocytic 
neoplasm. The neuronal cells do not appear neoplastic, and are interpreted as 
trapped native neurons.

Clinical History
•year-old man experienced a recent onset seizure and has a left facial droop. On imaging there is
a mass in
the medial and superior temporal lobe that extends into the insula, with mass effect and uncal herniation.
Operative Diagnoses
Benign brain neoplasm.
Operation / Specimen
A: Brain, right temporal lobe, excision biopsy
B: Brain, temporal lobe, excision biopsy
Pathologic Diagnosis
A and B. Brain ,right temporal ,excisional biopsies:
1.Oligodendroglioma, diffusely infiltrating.
2.MIB-1 proliferation index: 3%.
See Microscopy Description and Comment.
Comment
The sections contain portions of cerebral cortex and adjacent white matter that are diffusely and
moderately infiltrated
by a glial neoplastic proliferation made of rather uniform round nuclei, with some perineuronal satellitosis.
The MIB-1
proliferation index is somewhere between 1.5% and 3%. There is not mitotic activity, microvascular
proliferation, or
necrosis.
In this limited sample the neoplasm has a phenotype consistent with an oligodendroglial origin, and is
devoid of
anaplastic features (WHO II).

Date Ordered : Date Reported:
Interpretation
NEGATIVE: No evidence of methylated MGMT promoter is detected.
Results -Comments
Testing was performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block (B1). H&E stained slide
was examined
and marked by a pathologist for subsequent tumor dissection.
TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT promoter have been shown to
benefit
from therapy with alkylating agents .Assessment of MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite
treatment of
DNA followed by real-time PCR amplification of methylated and unmethylated DNA
sequences-The
analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by serial dilution of methylated positive control DNA into
unmethylated DNA, and was assessed to be 1% of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated
DNA. Factors
such as the presence of >50% non-neoplastic cells in the sample, or extensive tissue necrosis, may
preclude the
detection of methylated MGMT promoter sequences.

COMMENT 
In the three specimens there is a glial neoplastic proliferation with 
at. 
overall oligodendroglial phenotype with small proliferation centers, 
but also 
vlith a prominent astrocytic component. Mitotic figures are found with 
difficulty, and the MIB-l proliferation index is low at about 2% in 
the more 
active areas. There is no microvascular proliferation or necrosis. 
In 
specimen C there are some proliferation micro centers, some mitoses, 
and a feYl 
hyalinized vessels. 
The neoplasm is interpreted as a mixed oligoastrocytoma with low 
proliferation 
index WHO II/III. The focal proliferating activity may portend an 
aggressive

INTERPRETATION AND DIAGNOSIS:
1-5) BRAIN TUMOR :ANAPLASTIC ASTROCYTOMA, WHO GRADE III, SEE COMMENT.
COMMENT :While some of the lesion is grade II, tissue in 1A has the
cellularity, nuclear atypia, and mitotic activity of a grade III
lesion .The MIB --1 rate is approximately 5%. While there are some
oligodendroglioma features ,i.e. round uniform nuclei and
perivascular haloes ,the tumor, overall .,has features of astrocytoma.
Molecular studies found changes consistent with loss of
heterozygosity on 19q ,but not on lp. As such, the lp/19q codeletion
associated with oligodendroglioma was not present. Isolated loss of
19q is not uncommon in astrocytomas.

neoplastic cells. Only about 2% of neoplastic cells over express the p53 
protein. The NFP is non reactive. There is a MIB1 proliferation index of 
about 12% in the more active areas. \ 
\  Interpretation The immuno findings described below support the glioblastoma diagnosis. 
Results-Comments IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY: 0he neuronal markers (chromogranin and synaptophysin) 
demonstrate a neuropil background focally at the infiltrative edge of the 
tumor, and some entrapped neurons within the neoplasm. These neurons are

Pathologic Diagnosis
Brain ,right temporal ,excision: Mixed oligoastrocytoma ,anaplastic (WHO grade 111).
See Microscopy Description and Comment.
Comment
The sections contain large portions of brain extensively infiltrated and effaced by a very cellular glial
neoplastic
proliferation. The neoplastic cells have a mixed oligo astrocytic phenotype, there is focally brisk mitotic
activity, and
the MIB-1 proliferation index is about 75% in the more active areas .There is also focal endothelial
hyperplasia and
some microvascular proliferation. There are focal areas of necrosis and hemorrhage with some pigment,
most likely
associated wit previous surgical procedure.
The findings are interpreted as those of an anaplastic oligoastrocytoma.

PCR for EGFR variant III mutation
Date Ordered : Date Reported:
Interpretation
Surgical Pathology
Page 2 of 4
NEGATIVE - No evidence of EGFRvIll mutation is detected
Results -Comments
TEST DESCRIPTION: Testing performed on RNA extracted from paraffin tissue block (Al)
H and E slide was examined and no microdissection was needed.
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an attractive molecular target in glioblastoma because it
is amplified,
overexpressed, and/or mutated in up to 40% to 50% of patients. Epidermal growth factor receptor variant
III
(EGFRvIII) is an oncogenic, constitutively active mutant form of EGFR that is commonly expressed in
glioblastoma. Cell culture and in vivo models of glioblastoma have demonstrated EGFRvIII as defining prognostically
distinct
subgroups of glioblastomas .Additionally ,the presence of EGFRvIII has been shown to sensitize tumors
to EGFR
tyrosine kinase inhibitors when the tumor suppressor protein PTEN is intact. RNA is extracted from
formalin fixed,
paraffin embedded tissue samples and reverse transcribed to cDNA. The cDNA is then amplified using
standard PCR
technique for DNA templates. PCR products are detected by gel electrophoresis. The limit of detection of
this assay
has been determined to be approximately 5 mutant cells in 100 normal cells.
FDA Comment :The above data are not to be construed as the results from a stand alone diagnostic test.
This test
was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the
as required
by CLIA '88 regulations. It has not been cleared or approved for specific uses by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA). The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These
results are
provided for informational purposes only, and should be interpreted only in the context of established

Loss of Heterozygosity 1 p, 19q Assay (LOH)
Date Ordered : Date Reported:
Interpretation
NEGATIVE: Allelic loss on chromosome arm 1 p and chromosome arm 19q is NOT detected.
Informative loci are: D1S1612, D1S496, D19S219, D19S412, and PLA2G4C
Results -Comments
Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block (Al). DNA extracted from a
corresponding
blood specimen was used as a normal reference control.
H and E slide was examined and no microdissection was needed.
TEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA (baseline)/ Tumor DNA
pairs using 3
markers at both 1 p and 19q. The 3 markers on 1 p are D1 S548, D1 S1592, and D1 S552 (with D1 S468,
D1 S1612, and
D1S496 as backup markers) and the 3 markers on 19q are D19S219, D19S412, and PLA2G4C (with
D19S606 and
D19S1182 as backup). All markers are microsatellites (2 or 4 nt repeats) except PLA2G4C which is a
minisatellite (26
nt repeat) polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score, amplicon size, and
ease of
interpretation. The backup markers are used if the first line markers at that chromosome arm are
uninformative or
otherwise ambiguous in their interpretation. LOH at all informative loci on each chromosomal arm
represents the
typical finding in oligodendrogliomas with 1 p and 19q deletion.

Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block -Al
TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT promoter have been shown to
benefit
from therapy with alkylating agents. Assessment of MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite
treatment of
DNA followed by real-time PCR amplification of methylated and unmethylated DNA
sequences. The
analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by serial dilution of methylated positive control DNA into
unmethylated DNA, and was assessed to be 1% of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated
DNA. Factors
such as the presence of >50% non-neoplastic cells in the sample, or extensive tissue necrosis, may
preclude the
detection of methylated MGMT promoter sequences.

Addendum Diagnosis
Review of the slides confirms the diagnosis of a high-grade mixed oligodendroglial and astrocytic glioma.
A regional
area of increased cellular atypia and cellular density associated with focal microvascular proliferation is
noted. Focal
necrosis is also present. Considering these features, the differential diagnosis includes a high-grade
oligoastrocytoma
in transition to glioblastoma with oligodendroglial component, WHO grade IV. Clinical correlation is
recommended.
Addendum Comment
This addendum is issued for the purpose of pathology review requested by the clinical oncology team for

INTERPRETATION 
 
1p intact: A majority of nuclei showed similar numbers of 1p36 and 1q25 signals. There is no evidence of allelic loss on the short arm of chromosome 1 (1p).  19q intact: A majority of nuclei showed similar numbers of 19q13 and 19p13 signals. THere is no evidence of allelic loss of 19q.  Allelic loss at one locus does not necessarily predict the presence of alterations at other loci on the same chromosome, i.e. FISH may not detect partial allelic loss. FISH may not detect allelic losses if there is loss of one allele and replication on the allele.  
Comment:  
Several days after unstained slides from block A2 were received, additional unstained slides from 
block B1 were received. This was discussed with Dr. Mark Cohen on 2011. The unstained slides from 
block B1 will not be stained and will be returned.  
 Allelic loss on chromosome 1p has been shown to correlate with with chemoresponsiveness and long progression-free surival in some gliomas. This correlation is stronger when there is concomitant allelic loss on 19q. An association of chemoresponsiveness and/or long progression-free survivl with allelic loss on 19q in the absence of loss on 1p has not been established. In patients with 1p/19q loss,
 
Method:   
The integrity of the short arm of chromosome 1 (1p) and long arm of chromosome 19 (19q) was 
evaluated with interphase florescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using locus-specific probes target (1p36, 19q13) and reference probes (1q25,19p13) (Abbott Meloecular/Vysis, des Plaines, IL). The analysis was performed on areas of glial neoplasm and only atypical nuclei with two or more reference probe signals were counted. Reported quantitavtive data represents an average of 40 nuclei. Loss is defined as a ratio of less than or eugual to 0.7./ Aneusomy is defined as a mean of greater that or equal to 3.0 for the reference probe signals (1q25, 19p13).

Reviewer !nitiajsDISgt JALIFIFD I. Deep to cyst wall: White matter with cyst wall lined by moderately cellular, viable tumor.
Comment :This astrocytoma diffusely infiltrates white and gray matter. In some areas, especially the cyst
wall, the cells are as^ocjated with prominent microcystic change. Tumor cells have moderately
pleomorphic astrocytic nuclei, some naked and others with gemistocytic cytoplasm; other areas have a
more round, monotonous pattern suggestive of an oligodendroglioma component. Immunostain for p53 is
diffusely positive, however, arguing against an oligodendroglioma. Perineuronal satellitosis is seen. No
evidence of an underlying grade 1 tumor is seen (i.e. no EGBs, Rosethal fibers or noninfiltrative areas).
No mitoses are present. Though the cellularity and pleomorphism are in some areas pronounced, no
mitoses, vascular endothelial proliferation or necrosis are present. Immunostain for MIB-1 (slide C3)
shows a nuclear labeling rate of up to 6% (rates of greater than 3% are considered likely to represent
anaplastic change by Burger et al., Surgical Pathology of the Nervous System and its Coverings, 4th ed.).
Thus the tumor is WHO grade 2, but is likely to represent early anaplastic change .Molecular testing for
MGMT, 1 p 19q are in progress.

MGMT Methylation Assay
Specimen Type
Paraffin Block
Result
Gene Methylation DETECTED.
Methylation of the MGMT (O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyitransferase) gene was detected using methylation specific PCR technologies.
Methylation Score: 5.67
unmethylated <2.00
methylated >=2.00
Background
MGMT (0(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase) is a DNA repair enzyme that is involved in the repair of damage caused by a variety of
DNA crosslinking compounds, including alkylating agents .Increased methylation of the MGMT gene promoter region causes diminished or
silenced expression of the gene ,making cells more sensitive to DNA damage .This relationship has been shown for glioblastomas and
alkylating agents such as Temodar(R)(temozoiomide).
Approximately 40% to 45% of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tumors exhibit MGMT gene methylation .Retrospective studies have shown that
detection of MGMT promoter methylation in tumor samples is associated with an increased likelihood of a favorable response to temozolomide.

DNA is Isolated from formalin-fixed, paraffin -embedded (FFPE )specimen .Molecular analysis of the MGMT gene is performed by methylation-
specific PCR and detected on ABI7900 .The MGMT and beta Actin copy numbers will be used to calculate the ratio of MGMT/beta-Actin x1000.
Molecular-based testing Is highly accurate ,but as in any laboratory test, rare diagnostic errors may occur.
Results of this test are for investigational Purposes Only. The performance characteristic of this assay have been determined by The
result should not be used as a diagnostic procedure without confirmation of the diagnosis by another medically established diagnostic product
or procedure.

Justification: The tissue samples received are labeled with the patient's name and terms related to brain cyst walls and deep brain tissue.

Laterality: Not provided
Justification: The report does not mention any laterality information regarding the tissue samples.

Histology: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)
Justification: The MGMT methylation assay was performed on a paraffin block of glioblastoma, which is a type of brain tumor known as GBM.

Stage: Not applicable
Justification: Staging is not typically applied to brain tumors like GBM. Instead, they are graded based on their characteristics and malignancy.

Grade: High-grade glioma (presumed)
Justification: The presence of MGMT gene methylation in the tissue sample suggests a high-grade glioma, such as GBM, which is a highly malignant brain tumor.

Behavior: Malignant
Justification: GBM is a highly aggressive and malignant type of brain cancer with poor prognosis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Diagnosis:
Left temporal brain tumor
Anaplastic astrocytoma, grade 3
P53: focally positive
IDH1: Negative
MIB-1 LI: 13.3%
Discussion:940113,J65
Zy""""` I!e
The neoplastic cells are negative for IDH1 with a minority expressing p53. MIB-1
reactivity areas are seen within the tumor but in the most proliferative areas a labeling
index of 13.3% is calculated, consistent with a high grade astrocytoma.
Microscopic Description:
Sections demonstrate a diffusely infiltrative astrocytic neoplasm. Atypia ranges from
mild to moderate. There is mild to moderate hypercellularity. The tumor cells resemble
fibrillary astrocytes. Some areas are suggestive, but not definitive, for perinuclear halos.
A careful examination only reveals a rare mitotic figure. There is no microvascular
proliferation or necrosis.xz V .t 3

OF _ HAS BEE:N CHANG['D. 
BRAIN, RIGHT TEMPORAL LOBE, BIOPSY: SMALL CELL GLIOMA (TO BE FURTHER 
CLASSIFIED; SEE MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION): 
REVISED PATHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS: 
BRAIN, RIGHT TEMPORAL LOBE, BIOPSY: ASTROCYTOMA, ANAPLASTIC, 
DIFFUSELY INFILTRATING. 
Operation/Specimen: Brain, right temporal lobe. 
Clinical History and Pre-Op Dx: Patient with several month history of 
visual disturbances and headaches who has a CT scan lesion involving 
the right temporal lobe and extending across the midline to the left 
hemisphere. The differential diagnosis is between lymphoma and a 
glioma. 
,u>'~""~rIVE CONSULTATION: Astrocytoma, anaplastic 
GROSS PATHOLOGY: Specimen received in a container labeled with the 
patient's name and MRN. A portion of this specimen is used for the 
intraoperative consultation and for fixation in glutaraldehyde for 
eventual electron microscopy. The total amount of tissue removed 
equals 
approximately 5.0 9 and all remaining fragments are submitted in six 
tissue cassettes. 
MICROSCOPIC: Fragments of cerebral cortex and underlying white matter 
showing multiple, focal and diffuse infiltrates by small neoplastic 
cells that in general lack differentiation. In many areas the cells 
surrund individual neurons and in small sites they show some degree of 
cytoplasmic differentiation which appears similar to that of an 
astrocyte. There are mUltiple perivascular nests of neoplastic cells. 
Areas of coagUlation necrosis or atypical mitosis are not readily 
identified, however the general impression is that this pattern of 
tissue infiltrate may represent distant extension of a rather 
aggressive type of undifferentiated neoplasm. 
In summary, the impression formed at the time of the intraoperative 
consultation that this represents a small cell glioma with very 
anaplastic features is sustained by the evidence available at this  time. In an attempt to further identify the genetic derivation of 
these cells additional sections will be cut and reacted with various 
antisera as follows: GFAP, LCA, EMA, CK-6, Synaptophysin and MIB-1. 
In addition one of the samples taken for electron microscopy will be 
evaluated. 
An addendum will be issued when all of these are completed. 
COMMENT: Additional sections were cut from several blocks and reacted 
with the following antisera: LCA, EMA, CK-6, and Synaptophysin; these 
are negative in all the neoplastic cells. These results are 
interpreted as confirming the initial impression that the derivation 
of 
these cells is not from lymphocytes, neuronal elements, or epithelial 
cells. GFAP is expressed by approximately 20% of the neoplastic 
cells. 
MIB-1: This protein is expressed by diverse percentages of cells in 
various locations; however! the mean percentage of cells expressing 
this protein is estimated to be about 10%. 
Sections evaluated with the electron microscope confirm the impression 
that the cytoplasmic features as well as the nuclei of most neoplastic 
cells are compatible with those characteristic of a neoplastic 
astrocyte. 
A letter from Dr. 
in agreement with 
involuntary delay in the issuance of this final report represents a 
combination of simultaneous events including my absence from the 
department for over two weeks, and the fact that the slides were is 
mailed 
to Dr. IIIIIIIfor consultation before dictating the addendum, and his

Gross Description
A single specimen is received in formalin labeled with the patient's name,medical
record number and ""#1 left temporal tumor"". The specimen consists of three,
unoriented tan-white to graytissue fragments, grossly consistent with brain tissue
measuring 3.0 x 2.5 x 1.0 cm. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal no
focal lesions. Submitted entirely in cassettes 1A-1B.
Microscopic Examination
Sections show foci of increased cellularity within gray and white matter. The foci
have infiltrative borders and are composed of cells with irregularly shaped nuclei
and moderate amounts of eosinophilic cytoplasm. Frequent pleomorphic,
hyperchromatic, and occasional multinucleated cells are present.No significant
mitotic figures, necrosis or vascular proliferation with hyperplasia is identified.
immunohistochemical stains are performed with appropriately reactive positive and
negative controls and show the neoplastic cells to be positive for GFAP and
negative for synaptophysin and NeuN.

RESULTS 
 
 Chromosome 1p: Intact, aneusomic  Chromosome 19q: Intact, eusomic   
Quantitative FISH results 
 
1p36:3.3 1q25:3.2 1p36/1q25 ratio: 1.0  19q13:2.0 19q13: 2.5 19q13/19p13 ratio: 0.8  
INTERPRETATION 
  
 
1p intact: A majority of nuclei showed similar numbers of 1p36 and 1q25 signals. There is no evidence of allelic loss on the short arm of chromosome 1 (1p).  19q intact: A majority of nuclei showed similar numbers of 19q13 and 19p13 signals. There is no evidence of allelic loss of 19q.  Allelic loss at one locus does not necessarily predict the presence of alterations at other loci on the same chromosome, i.e. FISH may not detect partial allelic loss. FISH may not detect allelic losses if there is loss of one allele and replication on the allele.  
Comment:  
Allelic loss on chromosome 1p has been shown to correlate with with chemoresponsiveness and long 
progression-free survival in some gliomas. This correlation is stronger when there is concomitant 
allelic loss on 19q. An association of chemoresponsiveness and/or long progression-free survival with allelic loss on 19q in the absence of loss on 1p has not been established. In patients with 1p/19q loss,
 
Method:   
The integrity of the short arm of chromosome 1 (1p) and long arm of chromosome 19 (19q) was 
evaluated with interphase florescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using locus-specific probes target (1p36, 19q13) and reference probes (1q25,19p13) (Abbott Melecular/Vysis, des Plaines, IL). The analysis was performed on areas of glial neoplasm and only atypical nuclei with two or more reference probe signals were counted. Reported quantitative data represents an average of 40 nuclei. Loss is defined as a ratio of less than or equal to 0.7./ Aneusomy is defined as a mean of greater that or equal to 3.0 for the reference probe signals (1q25, 19p13).

A. AND B. BRAIN, LEFT, EXCISIONAL BIOPSIES: OLIGODENDROGLIOMA,
MIB-l LABELING INDEX < 1.0%.
SEE MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION AND COMMENT.
----------------------------------------------------------------Operation/Specimen: Brain.
Clinical History and Pre-Op Dx:year old woman with diagnosis 6
months ago of oligodendroglioma. For extensive resection.
GROSS PATHOLOGY: -
A. ""left tumor"", received fresh, one fragment, 0.8 cm. across.
Semifirm, pinkish-gray. In total #1.
INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION: Brain, left: glioma, low grade,
consistent with oligodendroglioma.
B. ""left tumor"", one fragment, 0.7 cm. across. Soft, pinkish-gray. In
total #2.
INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION: Brain, left: glioma, low grade,
consistent with oligodendroglioma.
MICROSCOPIC: A. and B. Portions of a moderately cellular neoplastic
glial proliferation, in which the cells display uniform round nuclei.
There is moderate nuclear pleomorphism and nuclear hyperchromasia. The
background is finely fibrillary, and the vascular network consists of
capillary-type vessels. Gliofibrillary oligodendrocytes and
minigemistocytes are rarely observed. There are no mitotic figures,
and areas of necrosis or microvascular cellular proliferation are not
observed.
SPECIAL STAINS: Immunoperoxidase methods for GFAP, synaptophysin, and
MIB-1 are performed on block #2.
With the GFAP the tumor cells are not immunoreactive. No tumor cells
immunoreact with synaptophysin. With the MIB-l a labeling index of
less than 1% is determined.
COMMENT: The neoplasm is a low grade glioma with uniform round
neoplastic nuclei, absent features of anaplasia, and a low MIB-l
labeling index of less than 1%. The nuclear pleomorphism is moderate
and consistent with a Smith's grade B.

Microscopic Description:  
Sections demonstrate a moderately hypercellular glial neoplasm. There is extensive 
infiltration through both gray and white matter. In the gray matter, perineuronal satellitosis is s triking. In the unfrozen material, most of the tumor cells are seem to have 
perinuclear halos. They have round nuclei with moderate atypia. No mitotic figures are seen. There is no microvascular proliferation or necrosis.  
 
Addendum Discussion:  
The calculated MIB -1 labeling index ranges up to 5.0% in the most proliferative regions 
of tumor. A MIB-1 labeling index of 5.0% is considered borderline by some studies for grade II and grade II oligodendrogliomas. The low grade features exhibited by this oligodendroglioma are more consistent with a grade II tumor; however, in light of the borderline MIB-1 index, this neoplasm should be closely followed for anaplastic progression and/or recurrence.

region: Oligodendroglioma with focal anaplastic progression (grade III).  
- MIB-1 labeling index: 8.2%  
 Microscopic Description : Sectio ns of the right frontal tumor demonstrate a diffusely 
moderately hypercellular neoplasm composed of mildly to moderately atypical 
oligodendrocytes. No microvascular proliferation or necrosis is seen. The tumor diffusely 
infiltrates both the gray and white matter. There is a generally consistent cellularity. However, slide 4B demonstrates nodular foci with both greater cellularity and atypia. In one of these regions 6 mitoses are seen in 10 high power fields. Overall, this pattern is consistent with early anaplastic progression of an underlying low grade oligodendroglioma. Sections of the inferior medial frontal lobe tumor also demonstrate a diffuse, moderately cellular oligodendroglioma. Here, again, there are nodular foci with greater cellularity. However, only 1 mitosis is identified in 30 high power fields in this region.

Comment
Permanent sections confirm the frozen section diagnosis and show a gemistocytic astrocytoma.
Intermingled with
nodules of medium large gemistocytes are ares of tightly packed ,higher -grade pleomorphic astrocytoma
nuclei with .
indistinct cytoplasm .Mitotic figures are easily identified .Vascular proliferation and necrosis are not seen.
The tissue fragments are relatively small, therefore a higher -grade lesion ,e.g. glioblastoma ,WHO grade
IV, cannot
be completely ruled out due to sampling phenomena .Clinical correlation is recommended.
The patient's tumor bank slide was also reviewed. Results of ancillary studies will be reported

NEGATIVE - No evidence of EGFRvIII mutation is detected
Results -Comments TEST DESCRIPTION :Testing performed on RNA extracted from paraffin tissue block
T(A2)
he epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an attractive molecular target in glioblastoma because it
is amplified,
overexpressed, and/or mutated in up to 40% to 50% of patients .Epidermal growth factor receptor variant
III
(EGFRvIII )is an oncogenic ,constitutively active mutant form of EGFR that is commonly expressed in
glioblastoma.
Cell culture and in vivo models of glioblastoma have demonstrated EGFRvIII as defining prognostically
distinct
subgroups of glioblastomas .Additionally ,the presence of EGFRvIII has been shown to sensitize tumors
to EGFR
tyrosine kinase inhibitors when the tumor suppressor protein PTEN is intact .RNA is extracted from
formalin fixed,
paraffin embedded tissue samples and reverse transcribed to cDNA. The cDNA is then amplified using
standard PCR
technique for DNA templates .PCR products are detected by gel electrophoresis. The limit of detection of
this assay
has been determined to be approximately 5 mutant cells in 100 normal cells.
FDA Comment :The above data are not to be construed as the results from a stand alone diagnostic test.

TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT promoter have been shown to
benefit
from therapy with alkylating agents. Assessment of MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfate
treatment of
DNA followed by real-time PCR amplification of methylated and unmethylated DNA
sequences. The
analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by serial dilution of methylated positive control DNA into
unmethylated DNA, and was assessed to be 1 % of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated
DNA. Factors

such as the presence of >50% non -neoplastic cells in the sample ,or extensive tissue necrosis, may
preclude the
detection of methylated MGMT promoter sequences.

IDHI/IDH2 Mutation Detection Assay
Date Ordered : Date Reported:
Interpretation
NEGATIVE - There is no evidence of IDH1 point mutation, as indicated by the absence of any nucleotide
changes in
codon 132 of the IDHI gene compared to the electropherogram of the reference normal sample (wild
type).
Results -Comments
TEST DESCRIPTION: IDH1/2 Mutation Analysis
Test performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block (A2)
H and E slide was examined and no microdissection was needed.
Mutation of IDH1 occurs early in glioma progression with somatic mutations of the R132 residue of IDH1
identified in
majority (>70%) of grades II and III astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas, as well as in secondary GBMs
that
developed from these lower grade lesions. Mutation analysis of closely related IDH2 revealed mutations
of IDH2
residue R172, with most mutations occurring in tumors lacking IDH1 mutations. Tumors with IDH1 or
IDH2 mutations
have distinctive genetic and clinical characteristics, and patients with such tumors have a better outcome
than those
with wild type IDH genes.
Mutations in IDH1/2 are detected by DNA sequencing procedures. The limit of detection of standard
bidirectional
sequencing is approximately 20-25%. In order to increase assay sensitivity tumor enrichment must be
performed by
manual microdissection when tumor cells in the block constitute less than 50% of nucleated cells.
FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a stand alone diagnostic

0peration/Specimen: A: Brain,right frontal lesion, biopsy 
; Brain, right frontal lesion, biopsy 
PATHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS: 
Brain, right frontal, excisional biopsies: 
1. Malignant glioma, pleomorphic, superficial (WHO III). 
2. MIB-l proliferation index: 35%. 
See Microscopy Description and Comment. 
COMMENT 
The neoplasm is a malignant proliferation of spindle/epithelioid cells that 
have prominent pleomorphism, focally brisk mitotic activity, and a high MIB-l 
proliferation index of about 35% throughout. The tumor is superficial, is 
growing focally in the leptomeningeal space, and has a prominent reticulin 
network. The tumor heavily infiltrates the brain, at its margins has 
astrocytic differentiation, and contains numerous eosinophilic granular 
bodies. Xanthomatous cells are found occasionally. 
Overall, the histological features are more consistent with an anaplastic 
pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (PXA) , in spite of the paucity of GFAP 
expression, a feature that has been observed in some PXAs, particularly when 
transformed into anaplastic tumors. The possibility of this tumor being a 
gliosarcorna has been considered; however the absence of a clear sarcomatous 
pattern, microvascular cellular proliferation, and tumor necrosis does not 
support that diagnosis at this point. 
The features in the biopsy may be correlated with clinical, imaging, and 
~oerative findings for their final interpretation and patient's follow up.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION 
IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY: The GFAP demonstrates paucity of fibrillary processes 
in the bulk of the neoplasm, where there are only small islands of 
gliofibrillogenesis; focally, where the tumor is infiltrative there is also 
gliofibrillogenesis by the neoplastic cells; these areas are also positive 
with S100, synaptophysin, MAP2, and NFP. Many cells throughout the tumor are 
positive with KPI. SMA, HHF35, and CD34 depict leptomeningeal vessel, and a 
microvasculature devoid of microvascular cellular proliferation. The neoplasm

COM M ENT: This glioblastoma multiforme is composed of extremely pleomorphic, bizarre cells, which are 
often multinucleated. The cytoplasm is primarily densely eosinophilic, consistent with a gemistocytic 
phenotype. A high percentage of the cells stain strongly for GFAP. Focally, the tumor can be seen 
infiltrating adjacent cortex. Mitoses, including abnormal mitotic figures, are easily identified. Microvascular 
proliferation is seen and focal necrosis is present. These features are diagnostic for glioblastoma 
multiforme by the criteria. It is also a glioblastoma multiforme by the  criteria, and it is a grade 
4 astrocytoma by the  criteria.

Received in formalin, a portion of irregular brain that weighs 24.0 g and measures 4.5 X
3.5 X 2.0 cm. Is lined by smooth, delicate and translucent leptomeninges, under which it
ispossible to recognize two broad gyri. To cuts, there is loss of distinction between
cortex and subcortical white matter due to irregular lesion, ill-defined, localized
predominantly in the white matter, composed of brown tissue, something firm, with
multiple small cavities, sometimes blackened, giving a spongy.
Microscopy:
Histological sections stained with H & E show infiltrative glial neoplasm, moderately
cellular, affecting the cortex and white matter, and composed of a mixed population of
glial cells. Most of these have round nuclei, dispersed chromatin and occasional
perinuclear halos and is located in the middle of areas with loose fibrillar matrix, forming
microcysts. Occasionally, we can observe some cells with eosinophilic and dense
cytoplasm, with eccentric nuclei (""minigemistocysts""). Another type of cell is
characterized by possessing more elongated nuclei with irregular outlines and dense
chromatin arranged in a dense fibrillar matrix. It is not observed mitotic figures,
microvascular proliferation or necrosis areas. It was performed immunohistochemistry
that revealed strong positivity in neoplasia for anti-GFAP and focal positivity for S100
protein .A semi -quantitative assessment of proliferation index with MIB -1antibody was
positive in less than 1 % of neoplastic nuclei.
Diagnosis:
Excision product of lesion on left frontal lobe: - Oligoastrocitoma, grade II - WHO
classification 2007.

However, the bulk of the neoplasm has an astrocytic phenotype, 
predominantly gemistocytic. 
ADDENDUM REPORT: 
IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY: Immunoperoxidase methods for GFAP, CD34, p53 and 
MIB-l were performed on sections from block 4. There is 
gliofibrillogenesis by the neoplastic cells. Only about 3% of the 
neoplastic cells over express the p53 protein. With the MIB-l, a 
proliferation index of about 20% is determinted in the more active 
areas. The diagnosis remains as above.

COMMENT 
In parts A and B there is an astrocytic neoplastic proliferation that 
diffusely infiltrates and focally effaces the brain parenchyma. The neoplasm 
has nuclear anaplasia, frequent multinucleated cells, mitoses, and 
microvascular cellular proliferation. 
Special stains to better characterize the neoplasm are being requested and 
will be reported as an addendum.

Results-Comments 
IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY: The GFAP depicts sparse gliofibrilogenesis by the 
neoplastic cells. The synaptophysin and NFP demonstrate a tenuous positive 
background, indicating the infiltrative character of the neoplasm. The Neu N 
demonstrates few small neurons entrapped by the neoplasm. More than 50% of 
the neoplastic cells over express the p53 protein, and about 28% of the cells 
are in the mitotic as 'cted by the MIB-l.

serially sectioned and submitted in toto in cassettes 13A"" and

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: Sections show an abnormal population of pleomorphic, poorly differentiated cells arranged in broad sheets and fascicles within the brain parenchyma. The malignant cells are characterized by 
pleomorphic, anaplastic nuclei with dense, hyperchromatic chromatin 
and occasionally discernable nucleoli and variable amounts of eosinophilic, often spindled, cytoplasm. Many bizarre forms are present which appear as giant, multinucleated cells. In cytologic preparations, scattered cells show poorly-formed cells processes. 
Numerous abnormal mitotic figures are present. Although broad areas of necrosis are seen, significant endothelial changes are not identified. Many malignant cells display eosinophilic proteinaceous cyto~lasmic globules. Brown pigment deposition is also present. Spec~al stains are performed which show the following: 
Pruss ian blue iron stain 
Fontana-Masson melanin stain 
GFAP 
AE1-AE3 cytokeratin stain

COMMENT: 
Most areas of this malignant tumor show no evidence of differentiation in immunoperoxidase stains. Melanocytic differentiation is seen in one of three melanoma stains (HMB-45). 
Rare focal positive staining is also seen for GFAP,neurofilament 
and desmin. These findings, taken together with the somewhat glial appearance of this tumor, suggest that this may be a primitive neuroectodermal tumor or glioblastoma with divergent differentiation. A malignant melanoma, either primary or metastatic, can not be ruled out.

2. MIS-1 proliferation index :\R\ 4%.
See Comment.
COMMENT
In both specimens ,a moderately cellular glial neoplasm diffusely infiltrates
the cerebral cortex and white matter. The neoplastic cells are naked, mostly
round,but also elongated (mainly in the white matter ),with slight
pleomorphism .Focally ,there are hypercellular areas (""proliferation
centers""), perinuclear halos ,and one zone of microcystic change. Mitotic
figures are found with difficulty ,and the MIB-1 proliferation index is at
about 4% in the more active areas .There is no microvascular cellular
proliferation or necrosis.
The neoplasm is a mixed oligoastrocytoma ,predominantly oligodendrocytic.
There are no overt features of anaplasia (microvascular proliferation or
necrosis ).There are ,however ,proliferation centers and a few mitoses that
probably portend an aggressive behavior ,i. e. an ""intermediate"" mixed glioma,

Sections demonstrate a variably cellular glioma that diffusely infiltrates both the gray and white matter.
The majority of the tumor cells demonstrate prominent perinuclear halos. ""They consistently have round
to oval nuclei. Atypia is moderate. Cellularity is accentuated in a multinodular pattern. Neither
microvascular proliferation nor necrosis are identified .A few scattered mitotic figures are seen, but
these are insufficient by themselves to warrant classification as anaplastic.
Scattered MIB-1 reactive cells are present throughout the tumor. However ,even in the most
proliferative regions ,a labeling index of only 2.2% is calculated .Combined with the other histologic
features ,this does not warrant classification as anaplastic /grade Ill. Nevertheless, the cluster of
hypercellularity and degree of atypia is somewhat worrisome and close follow up is indicated.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION 
IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY: The GFAP demonstrates a gliofibrillary 
background with 
abundant gemistocytes. More than 45% of the tumor cells over express 
the p53 
protein. With the MIB-1 a proliferation index greater than 10% is 
determined 
in the more active areas. 
These results support the diagnosis of an aggressive astrocytoma.

COMMENT 
The specimens are fragments of cerebrum that are infiltrated and extensively 
effaced by a glial neoplastic proliferation that has proclivity for the white 
matter. The neoplastic cells are small, elongated naked nuclei. There is 
brisk mitotic activity with a very high proliferation index of about 60%. 
There is prominent microvascular cellular proliferation and zones of tumor 
necrosis, some with pseudopalisading. Within the tumor and adjacent brain tissue there is recent hemorrhage. 
The morphology and immunophenotype are characteristic of a glioblastoma that 
has undergone recent bleeding.

~OSITIVE -EGFRvIII mutation is detected 
Results-Comments 
TEST DESCRIPTION: Testing performed on RNA extracted from tumor paraffin block 
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an attractive molecular target 
in glioblastoma because it is amplified, overexpressed, and/or mutated in up 
to 40% to 50% of patients. Epidermal growth factor receptor variant III 
(EGFRvIII) is an oncogenic, constitutively active mutant form of EGFR that is 
commonly expressed in glioblastoma. Cell culture and in vivo models of 
glioblastoma have demonstrated EGFRvIII as defining prognostically distinct 
subgroups of glioblastomas. Additionally, the presence of EGFRvIII has been 
shown to sensitize tumors to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors when the tumor 
suppressor protein PTEN is intact. RNA is extracted from formalin fixed, 
paraffin embedded tissue samples and reverse transcribed to cDNA. The cDNA is 
then amplified using standard PCR technique for DNA templates. PCR products 
are detected by gel electrophoresis. The limit of detection of this assay has 
been determined to be approximately 5 mutant cells in 100 normal cells.

 Microscopic  Discussion:  
 Sections demonstrate a mildly to moderat ely hypercellular diffuse glioma 
involving both the gray and white matter.  In contrast to the usual diffuse glial tumor, gray ma tter involvement predominates. Tumor  cells have enlarged round 
to oval nuclei and most have perinuclear halos.  Atypia is mild to moderate.  The gray matter shows secondary structures including striking perineuronal satellitosis as well as subpial condensation and foca perivascular accumulat ion.  
No mitotic figures are identified.   
 Addendum Discussion : 
 Scattered MIB -1 reactive cells are present throughout the specimen.  Because of 
the unusual growth pattern with numerous admixed neurons, a precise labeling 
index cannot be determined.  However, it appears that greater than 5% of the 
tumor nuclei are positive.  Whereas this does not by itself warrant classification of anaplastic grade 3, it is worrisome and does merit close follow -up.

Comment: 
The proliferation index of this tumor is minimally increased compared 
to that expected for the upper limit of a grade II astrocytoma. 
Typically such tumors have a proliferation index between 0 and 3%. The 
presence of a single mitosis is insufficient to grade this tumor as an 
anaplastic astrocytoma (grade III of IV). Nevertheless , the somewhat 
slightly increased proliferation index should prompt close clinical 
follow-up. 
This diagnostic report has been personally interpreted by the signatory 
of record. 
Microscopic Description: 
The tumor consists of a mildly pleomorphic and infiltrative 
proliferation of astrocytic cells. There is no endothelial 
proliferation and no necrosis. Very rare mitoses (1 definite) are 
present. Immunohistochemistry for the proliferation antigen Ki67 was 
performed as follows. Four 250 x 250 micron fields were examined and

Comment
Permanent sections confirm the frozen section diagnosis. Sections of A. and B. show a mostly astrocytic
appearing
glial neoplasm. C. and D. are larger specimens and display mostly oligodendroglial features with mostly
round nuclear
morphology, ropy myelin, delicate vessels and microcyst formation. Rare mitotic figures are noted in
specimen D.
Microvascular proliferation and/or necrosis is not identified. The Ki-67 labeling index is up to
approximately 5%. The
IDH1 R132H mutation antibody is negative. Controls show appropriate immunoreactivity.
The very focal mitotic activity seen in specimen D. may reflect that the lesion could be in transition to a
higher grade.
Clinical correlation is recommended.

TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT promoter have been shown to
benefit
from therapy with alkylating agents. Assessment of MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite
treatment of
DNA followed by real-time PCR amplification of methylated and unmethylated DNA
sequences. The
analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by serial dilution of methylated positive control DNA into unmethylated DNA, and was.assessed to be 1 % of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated
DNA. Factors
such as the presence of >50% non-neoplastic cells in the sample, or extensive tissue necrosis, may
preclude the
detection of methylated MGMT promoter sequences.

Loss of Heterozygosity I p, I9q Assay (LOH)
Date Ordered : Date Reported:
Interpretation
Findings suggestive of partial deletion of chromosome arm 19q on locus D19S606
(D19S412, D19S1182 - no evidence of loss of heterozygosity).
NEGATIVE: Allelic loss on chromosome arm 1 p is NOT detected.
Informative loci are: D1 S548, D1 S592, D1 S552, D1 S1612, D19S412, D19S606, and D19S1182
Results -Comments
Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block DNA extracted from a
corresponding blood specimen was used as a normal reference control.
H and E slide was examined and tumor DNA was enriched by microdissection
TEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA (baseline)/ Tumor DNA
pairs using 3
markers at both 1 p and 19q. The 3 markers on 1 p are D1 S548, D1 S1592, and D1 S552 (with D1 S468,
D1 S1612, and
D1 S496 as backup markers) and the 3 markers on 19q are D19S219, D19S412, and PLA2G4C (with
D19S606 and
D19S1182 as backup). All markers are microsatellites (2 or 4 nt repeats) except PLA2G4C which is a
minisatellite (26
nt repeat) polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score, amplicon size, and
ease of
interpretation. The backup markers are used if the first line markers at that chromosome arm are
uninformative or
otherwise ambiguous in their interpretation. LOH at all informative loci on each chromosomal arm
represents the
typical finding in oligodendrogliomas with 1 p and 19q deletion.

1. Permanent section of the frozen section specimen demonstrates only poorly cellular dense fibrous connective tissue. No neoplasm identified  
2, 10, 13.  Permanent section of the frozen section specimen demonstrates a mildly hypercellular glial neoplasm that diffusely  infiltrates the parenchyma which is predominantly  
white matter.  There is edema as well.  Atypia is mild to moderate.  No mitotic figures are seen.  There is no microvascular proliferation or necrosis.  No mitotic figures are identified.  
3,7. Permanent section of the frozen section specimen and unfrozen material again demonstrate a modestly hypercellular glial neoplasm that is more diffusely infiltrative than cellular.  The features are otherwise as described in specimen 2.  No mitotic figures are identified.  
4, 8  Permanent section of the frozen section specimen and unfrozen material demonstrate  a 
mildly hypercellular, apparently low grade glioma that diffusely infiltrates the gray and white matter.  The features are as previously described, but this specimen is more cellular than 
either specimen 2 or 3.  No mitotic figures are identified.  
5, 9.  permanent section of the frozen section specimen and unfrozen material confirm the presence of a cellular and infiltrating apparently low grade glioma.  In addition, a nodular area with numerous  foci of dystrophic calcifications are seen.  No mitotic figures are 
identified.  
6.  Sections demonstrate variably thickened and poorly cellular dense irregular fibrous connective tissue.  The tissue demonstrates multifocal reactive changes including edema, macrophage infiltrates, chronic inflammation and microcalcificatins.  Focally, the fibrous tissue is adherent to gliotic brain parenchyma which also demonstrates old hemorrhage.  N o 
neoplasm is seen.  No mitotic figures are identified.  
11.  Permanent section of the frozen section specimen demonstrates a modestly hypercellular glial neoplasm that diffusely infiltrates the white matter.  Although qualifying as cellular tumor, this specimen as cellular tumor, this specimen is less cellular than any of the previous specimens.  
12.  Permanent section of the frozen section specimen demonstrates a modestly hypercellular glial neoplasm that diffusely infiltrates gray and white matter.  A larg e band of 
dystrophic calcification is also seen.  The specimen is less cellular than most of the previous biopsies, but more than specimen 11.  
 Addendum discussion : 
MIB-1 reactivity varies greatly within the tumor.  In the less cellular areas only a few MI B-1 
reactive cells are present with a labeling index of <1% to about 3%.  However, in some of the moderately cellular areas there are patchy areas of high MIB -1 reactivity.  In these areas the 
labeling of 12.5% s calculated. Based on the overall findings, the MIB -1 labeling suggest 
anaplastic progression in the background of a low grade glioma.

Results-Comments 
TEST DF.~r~TPTTn~. To~r~_ng performed on RNA extracted from paraffin tissue 
block' 
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an attractive molecular target 
in glioblastoma because it is amplified, overexpressed, and/or mutated in up 
to 40% to 50% of patients. Epidermal growth factor receptor variant III 
(EGFRvIII) is an oncogenic, constitutively active mutant form of EGFR that is 
commonly expressed in glioblastoma. Cell culture and in vivo models of 
glioblastoma have demonstrated EGFRvIII as defining prognostically distinct 
subgroups'of glioblastomas. Additionally, the presence of EGFRvIII has been 
shown to sensitize tumors to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors when the tumor 
suppressor protein PTEN is intact. RNA is extracted from formalin fixed, 
paraffin embedded tissue samples and reverse transcribed to cDNA. The cDNA is 
then amplified using standard PCR technique for DNA templates. PCR products 
are detected by gel electrophoresis. The limit of detection of this assay has 
been determined to be approximately 5 mutant cells in 100 normal cells.

IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY: The neoplasm has a heavy GFAP-positive 
gliofibrillary background. Over 95% of the neoplastic cells strongly over 
express the p53'protein. With the MIB-l about 65% of the cells throughout the 
tumor are cycling. The CD163 depicts perivascular microglia only in the areas 
of vlell preserved tumor tissue, and abundant phagocytic cells in the areas of 
tumor necrosis. The CD34 highlights the microvasculature with frequent 
microvascular cellular proliferation. The neuronal markers synaptophysin and 
NeuN demonstrate the diffusely infiltrative character of the neoplasm.

Cerebral cortex segment weighing 36 grams and measuring 5.2 x 4 .5 x 3.5 cm. One of
itssides is coated by lightly congested menige .The other side shows up bloody,
brownish ,with hemorrhagic areas.
Microscopy:
The histological sections showed neuroepithelial and multinodular malignant neoplasm,
composed of rounded and monomorphic nuclei cells ,with granular chromatin and with
mild hyperchromasia .The cytoplasm is scanty, observing ,sometimes ,clear perinuclear
halos .We also observed some large and eosinophilic cytoplasm cells with
minigemistocistic pattern (GFOC). The tumor is infiltrating ,undermining the white matter
and adjacent neocortex ,which are seen outbreaks of neuronal sattelitosis .Are seen
some secondary Scherer structures and extent of the neoplasm to the adjacent
subarachnoid and the Virchow Robin spaces. Are also seen foci of necrosis and
dystrophic calcification .The mitotic figures are easily found .Calls attention the
presence of dystrophic calcification in the media of some arteries of medium caliber.
Diagnosis:
Biopsy product of the left temporal lesion: anaplastic oligodendroglioma, WHO grade II
(9451/3).
Award of 1 p/1 9q deletion analysis:
The hybridizations were performed on 5 micrometers thick sections of formalin-fixed
and paraffin-embedded neoplastic tissue (FFPE) in the most representative tumor area
with 1p36/1q25 and 19q13/19p13 probe. 100 to 200 were evaluated in each

Addendum Discussion:
The neoplastic cells are diffuselyimmunoreactive for p53, suggesting a astrocytic origin.
Numerous MIB-1 reactive cells are present with a labeling index estimated at 20%.
Although a minor population suggesting oligodendroglioma differentiation was seen, this strong
diffused p53 positivity argues against this and suggests that the apparent gerinuclear halos were
simply cells with poor differentiation in a few processes.
Addendum Diagnosis:
Anaplastic Astrocytoma (WHO grade III)
Microscopic Description:
1, 2 sections demonstrate a markedly hypercellular glial neoplasm that diffusely infiltrates both
gray and white matter .The majority of the tumor cells have an oligodendroglioma phenotype with
perinuclear halos and fine branching vasculature. However ,a significant minority of an
astrocytoma phenotype is also seen. Atypica is moderate to focally marked. Numerous mitotic
figures are seen .Neither microvascular proliferation nor necrosis are present.
3. Sections demonstrate a similar diffuse glial neoplasm .However ,here most areas show a less
cellular and infiltrating tumor.

 female presents today for craniotomy 
for resection of left tempora rain tumor. History of headaches, left 
eye blurriness. MRI showed abnormality in left temporal area. 
GROSS DESCRIPTION: Received the following specimens in the Department of 
Pathology, labeled with the patient's name and hospital #: . 
A .. Tumor 
B. Tumor #2 
The specimen is received fresh and consists of a 6.5 x 4.0 x 1.5 ern 
rectangular piece·of cerebral cortex and underlying subcortical white 
matter. The deep surfaces are cauterized and focally hemorrhagic. The 
meningeal surface has a prominent surface vasculature with the usual 
gyral and focused pattern. Sectioning reveals the majority of the 
specimen to have a clear demarcation between apparent cortex and adjacent 
white matter layers, however, along one deep edge the gray matter is 
obscured by an ill-defined firm white lesion measuring 2.2 x 1.5 x 1.0 em 
in greatest dimension. A representative section of the lesion is 
submitted for frozen section. Frozen section diagnosis is, ""Infiltrating 
glioma with focal ~ areas; final diagnosis deferred to permanent 
sections,l1 per _ The frozen tissue is submitted for permanent 
processing in cassette FSA1. Additional representative sections of the 
lesion are submitted in cassettes A2-A6. A representative section of 
uninvolved cortex is submitted in cassette A7. 
The specimen is· received without fixative and consists of a 2.5 x 1.8 x 
0.4 cm rectangular piece of cortical brain tissue. Sectioning reveals 
the demarcation between the gray and adjacent white matter layers to be 
smudged and ill-defined. No discrete lesion is grossly identified. A 
representative portion of the tissue is submitted for frozen section. 
Frozen section diagnosis is, ""Infiltrating glioma/II per  . The 
frozen tissue is submitted for permanent processing in cassette. FSB1. 
The remaining tissue is entirely submitted in cassettes B2-B4.  
DIAGNOSIS: 
A. II Tumor It : 
Anaplastic mixed ~lioma (oligoastrocytoma) (WHO Grade 
III) (see comment) 
B. ""Tumor #2"": 
Anaplastic mixed glioma (oligoastrocytoma) (see 
comment) 
COMMENT: This infiltrating glioma extensively infiltrates gray and white 
matter. The predominant pattern is that of a diffuse anaplastic 
astrocytoma with moderate nuclear and cellular pleomorphism and 
significant mitotic activity·(S mitoses per ten high power fields in some 
 areas). However/ areas· having a ve~y uniform and distinctly 
oligodendrogliomatous histologic appearance are also present, although 
these are in the minority. The Ki67 labeling index is about 10-15% 
overall. These findings support the diagnosis. The tumor is negative 
for' PTEN and EGFRvIII. The pattern of GFAP immunoreactivity suggests 
positive staining of both neoplastic and reactive elements. 
The status of chromosomes 1p and 19q will be determined by 
fluorescence in situ hybridization and reported as an addendum to this 
report. ""I/· or my qualified designee I have per~ormed the gross examination

white matter. Representative sections in B1-4 (approximately 50% of specimen
submitted).
INTRA OPERATIVE CONSULTATION:
A. ""Brain tissue"":AF1 (in toto)-glioma, low grade {
MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:
Microscopic examination shows brain infiltrated by a glial neoplasm
characterized by cellular pleomorphism ,and microvascular changes. A ki-67
immunostain yields a proliferation rate of 10% .No necrosis is seen.
Tumor is noted to be growing in Virchow-Robin spaces along blood vessels, as
well as in the subarachnoid region. Occasional satellitosis is noted,
suggestive of an oligodendrocytic component, however the majority of the
histology is more compatible with a diagnosis of astrocytoma. Additionally, a
GFAP immunostain decorates large reactive astrocytes.
IMMUNOHISTBCHEMICAL FINDINGS:
xi-67 immunostaining reveals a proliferation rate of 10%. GFAP highlights
large reactive astrocytes. HAM-56 fails to detect significant macrophages.

Justification: The diagnosis of Anaplastic Astrocytoma (WHO Grade III) is based on the needle biopsy and resection specimens, which showed similar results. The FISH interpretation summary indicates abnormalities in EGFR, 7 CEP, and 1p36 markers, suggesting a phenotypic appearance of oligoastrocytoma.

(see comment). 
COMMENT Sections show a densely cellular tumor demonstrating vascular proliferation 
and necrosis. The tumor cells are diffusely positive for GFAP and p53. The 
Ki-67 labeling index is variable, but is focally up to 60% in several areas. 
Results of MGMT promoter methylation and EGFRvIII mutation assays will be

PROCEDURES/ADDENDA 
PCR for EGFR 
Date Ordered: 
Interpretation Date Reported: 
POSITIVE -EGFRvIII mutation is detected 
Results-Comments  TEST DESCRIPTION: Testing performed on RNA extracted from tumor paraffin 
block 
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an attractive molecular 
target 
in glioblastoma because it is amplified, overexpressed, and/or mutated in up 
to 40% to 50% of patients. Epidermal growth factor receptor variant III 
(EGFRvIII) is an oncogenic, constitutively active mutant form of EGFR that 
is 
commonly expressed in glioblastoma. Cell culture and in vivo models of 
glioblastoma have demonstrated EGFRvIII as defining prognostically distinct 
subgroups of glioblastomas. Additionally, the presence of EGFRvIII has been 
shown to sensitize tUmors to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors when the tumor 
suppressor protein PTEN is intact. RNA is extracted from formalin fixed{ 
paraffin embedded tissue samples and reverse transcribed to cDNA. The cDNA 
is 
then amplified using standard peR technique for DNA templates. peR products 
are detected by gel electrophoresis. The limit of detection of this assay 
has 
been determined to be approximately 5 mutant cells in 100 normal cells.

provided for informational purposes only, and should be interpreted only in 
the context of established procedures and/or diagnostic criteria. 
Interpretation 
NEGATIVE: No evidence of methylated MGMT promoter is detected. 
Results-Comments 
Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block. 
TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT promoter 
have been shown to benefit from therapy with alkylating agents. Assessment 
of 
MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite treatment of DNA 
follov16d 
by real-time peR amplification (MethyLight) of methylated and unmethylated 
DNA 
sequences.  The analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by serial dilution of 
methylated positive control DNA into unmethylated DNA, and was assessed to 
be 
1% of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated DNA. Factors such as 
the presence of >50% non-neoplastic cells in the sample, or extensive tissue 
necrosis, may preclude the detection of methylated MGMT promoter sequences.

COMMENT 
Sections show a mitotically active tumor composed of strongly GFAP and 
S100 
positive areas with cells resembling neoplastic astrocytes and other 
more 
epithelioid cells resembling meningioma. Microvascular proliferation 
is 
present hOl-lever I is not a dominant feature of the tumor vasculature. A 
distinct area shows more spindle shaped cells which are mostly GFAP 
and S100 
negative and CD34 and reticulin positive. Vimentin is diffusely 
positive. EMA 
shows scattered weak positivity. Pan-keratin is negative. The Ki-67 
labeling 
index is up to approximately 30%. Positive and negative controls show 
appropriate immunoreactivity. 
This is an unusual tumor. Considering the present histological 
findings and 
clinical findings revie\-ved at our recent 
the lesion 
appears to be more consistent with gliosarcoma. A recent study found 
that  gliosarcomas resembling meningiomas (surgically and macroscopically) 
may be 
associated with prolonged patient survival compared to classical

demonstrate a glial, infiltrative tumor of mar^ed hypercellularity.The nuclei
contain moderate pleomorphism and hyperchromasia and scatteredmitoses are seen.
Many of the nuclei display round profiles, but many others are angular in contour.
There is no microvascular proliferation or necrosis identified in the neoplasm.
immunohistochemistry for glial fibrillary acidic protein is diffusely positive in
the tumor.MIB-1 is positive in approximately 20% of nuclei. IDH-i is diffusely
positive in the tumor, therefore, the tumor is likely to be mutated for IDH-1.
Both p53 and PTEN ixnmunostains are diffusely positive. All controls are
appropriate.

MGMT METHYLATION ASSAY : GENE METHYLATION DETECTED.

MGMT Methylation Assay:
Result: Gene Methylation DETECTED.
Methylation Score: 9.46
--REFERENCE VALUE--
unmethylated <2.00
methylated >=2.00
Background:
MGMT (0(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase] is a DNA repair enzyme that is
involved in the repair of damage caused by a variety of DNA crosslinking compounds,
including alkylating agents. Increased methylation of the MGMT gene promotor
region causes diminished or silenced expression of the gene, making cells•more
sensitive to DNA damage. This relationship has been shown for glioblastomas and
alkylating agents such as temozolomide. Approximately 40-50% of glioblastomas
exhibit MGMT gene methylation. Retrospective studies have shown that detection of
MGMT promotor methylation in tumor samples is associated with an increased
likelihood of a favorable response to temozolomide.
Methodology':
DNA is isolated from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens.
Molecular analysis of the MGMT gene is performed by methylation-specific PCR and
detected on AB17900. The MGMT and beta-Actin copy numbers are used to calculate
the ratio of MGMT/beta-Actin x1000. Molecular-based testing is highly accurate,
but as in any laboratory test, rare diagnostic errors may occur. Results of this
test are for Investigational Purposes Only. The performance characteristics of
this assay have been determined by .The result should not be used as a
diagnostic procedure without confirmation of the diagnosis by another medically
established diagnostic product or procedure.

RESULTS
Ratio of 0.89 Cell count of lp/lq: 142
Ratio of 0.70 Cell count of 19q/19p: 131
Interpretation of Results: A) lp no loss ;B)19q loss
Interpretation of findings:
A) (negative) The majority of tumors cells displayed 2 to 3 control
chromosome 1q25 signals and 2 to 3 chromosome 1p36 signals
(locus of interest), and the ratio of 1p36/1q25 Ratio was >0.8. The
results are consistent with no loss of the 1p36 locus of interest.
B) (positive) The majority of tumors cells displayed 2 control
chromosome 19p13 signals and 1 chromosome 19q13 signals (locus of
interest). The ratio of 19q13/19p13 is <0.8 .The results are
consistent with the loss of 1p36 locus of interest.

Comments
The resultant FISH section /slide is scanned by a trained licensed
medicaltechnologist and analyzed using a FDA -approved ,validated
semi-automated scanning imaging workstation and accompanying imaging
analysis software ' The resultant FISH section /slide is then
presented to the interpreting Pathologist, who will reviews the FISH
results from and compares them to the results manually observed
under an Olympus Fluorescence Microscope .Therefore the ratio is enumerated
by computer -aided counting as well as manual counting.
Interpretation of Test
The ratio for probe set 1 is derived by dividing the total number of
LSI 1p36 signals by the total number of LSI 1q25 signals in at least 20
interphase nuclei with
nonover-lapping--nut-le-i-irr the n^oglastic gl#a^^erls: ^e Y^wi Yr n^ stgrxals -
or with signals of only one color are disregarded. The ratio for probe set
2 is derived by dividing the total number of LSI 19813 signals by the total Page 3
number of LSI 19p13 signals in at least 2 sets of 20 interphase nuclei with
nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic glial cells at two different areas
of the sample. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are
disregarded. References ranges for our laboratory for allelic loss versus
no allelic loss were established by evaluating both probe sets in a series
of 40 normal cases from 10 different organs .For both probe set 1 and 2 a
ratio of less than 0.80 taken from at least 2 sets of 20 interphase nuclei
at 2 different areas with nonoverlapping nuclei is consistent with allelic
loss. FISH and H&&E stained slides have been reviewed by the
interpreting pathologist.

ddendum Discussion: 
The calculated MIB -1 Labeling Index overall appears low with focal regions increased at 
4.9%. Overall, the histologic features of this tumor are consistent with a low grade 
oligodendroglioma; however, the MIB- 1 Labe ling index is borderline for a low grade 
oligodendroglioma (<5%; WHO,  Close followup for recurrence and/or anaplastic progression may be warranted.   
Brain Tumor, Biopsy and Resection: 
 
Oligodendroglioma (Who grade II) 
MIB -1 Labeling Index = 4.9%  
  
Microscopic Description:  
 
1,2 Sections of gray and white matter demonstrate a diffusely infiltrating glioma. The tumor is mildly to moderately hypercellular. It is composed of cells with round to somewhat irregular nuclei and scant processes. Most have per nicuclear halos. Only a rare 
mitotic figure is seen. No microvascular proliferation or necrosis is present.

Comment
Permanent sections confirm the frozen section diagnosis. Sections show a glioma with mostly
oligodendroglial
features. Some most angulated cells are also noted suggesting a lesser astrocytic component. Mitotic
activity is noted
in specimen B. Vascular proliferation and/or necrosis is not seen .The Ki-67 labeling index is up to
approximately 8%.
Controls show appropriate reactivity.
Although the lesion meets criteria for a grade II oligodendroglioma, the focal mitotic activity may suggest
that it is in
transition to a grade III lesion. Clinical correlation is recommended.
Controls show appropriate reactivity.

MGMT Promoter Methylation
Date Ordered : Date Reported:
Interpretation
POSITIVE: Methylated MGMT promoter is detected.
Surgical Pathology
Page 2 of 4
Results -Comments
Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block
H and E slide was examined and no microdissection was needed.
TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT promoter have been shown to
benefit
from therapy with alkylating agents. Assessment of MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite
treatment of
DNA followed by real-time PCR amplification of methylated and unmethylated DNA
sequences. The
analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by serial dilution of methylated positive control DNA into unmethylated DNA, and was assessed to be 1% of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated
DNA. Factors
such as the presence of >50% non-neoplastic cells in the sample ,or extensive tissue necrosis, may
preclude the
detection of methylated MGMT promoter sequences.
FDA COMMENT :The above data are not to be construed as the results from a stand alone diagnostic
test. This test
was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the
as required
by CLIA '88 regulations. It has not been cleared or approved for specific uses by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA). The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These
results are
provided for informational purposes only, and should be interpreted only in the context of established
procedures

Loss of Heterozygosity 1p, 19q Assay (LOH)
Date Ordered: Date Reported:
Interpretation
NEGATIVE: Allelic loss on chromosome arm 1 p and chromosome arm 19q is NOT detected.
Informative loci are: D1 S1592, D1 S552, D1 S1612, D19S219, D19S412 and PLA2G4C
Results-Comments
Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block DNA extracted from a
corresponding blood specimen was used as a normal reference control.
H and E slide was examined and no microdissection was needed.
TEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA (baseline)/ Tumor DNA
pairs using 3
markers at both 1 p and 19q. The 3 markers on 1 p are D1 S548, D1 S1592, and D1 S552 (with D1 S468,
Dl 51612, and
D1 S496 as backup markers) and the 3 markers on 19q are D19S219, DI 95412, and PLA2G4C (with
D19S606 and
DI 9S1 182 as backup). All markers are microsatellites (2 or 4 nt repeats) except PLA2G4C which is a
minisatellite (26
nt repeat) polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score, amplicon size, and
ease of
interpretation. The backup markers are used if the first line markers at that chromosome arm are
uninformative or
otherwise ambiguous in their interpretation. LOH at all informative loci on each chromosomal arm
represents the
typical finding in oligodendrogliomas with I p and 1 9q deletion.
FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a stand-alone diagnostic
test. This test

CLINICAL HISTORY:
Not provided. MRI: A large region of masslike heterogeneous T2 hyperintensity
centered within the right frontal lobe, extending into the genu and anterior
body of the corpus callosum. The region of T2 hyperintensity measures
approximately 9.3 x 7.3 cm, greatest orthogonal axial dimensions, not
significantly changed from prior. Multiple small central Ti hypointense foci,
without signal on FLAIR images, likely represent small areas of cystic
change/necrosis. No significant enhancement is present in this region. No
distant foci of abnormal parenchymal signal are present. Mass effect continues
to result inapproximately 1.2 cm of right-to-left midline shift, unchanged. No
abnormal extra-axial fluid collections. Basal cisterns are patent. The right
frontal horn is completely effaced, with partial effacement of the right
lateral ventricle body.

Result:
MGMT PROMOTER METHYLATION IDENTIFIED (METHYLATION INDEX = 13.28; SEE NOTE).
Note:
The specimen is considered negative for MGMT promoter methylation when
Methylation Index (MI) is less than 4. MI between 4 and 16 is considered as
low level methylation and should be interpreted with caution since the
significance of low level methylation in gliomas is not well understood. MI
greater than 16 is considered as methylated.
Background:
MGMT (O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase) is a DNA repair enzyme
that is involved in the repair of damage caused by a variety of DNA
crosslinking compounds, including alkylating agents. Increased
methylation of the MGMT gene promoter region causes diminished or
silenced expression of the gene, making cells more sensitive to DNA
damage. This relationship has been shown for glioblastomas and
alkylating agents such as Temodar(R)(temozolomide).
Approximately 40% to 45% of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tumors
exbi hi t MGMT gene methyl ati on - ^c hnrrn } t
detection of MGMT promoter methylation in tumor samples is associated
with an increased likelihood of a favorable response to temozolomide.
Methodology:
DNA is isolated from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
specimen. Molecular analysis of the MGMT gene is performed by
methylation-specific PCR. Molecular-based testing is highly accurate but
as in any laboratory test, rare diagnostic errors may occur.
Results of this test are for Investigational Purposes Only. The
performance characteristic of this assay have been determined by
The result should not be used as a diagnostic procedure

GENERAL: A 5.5 x 4 x 1.5 cm. aggregate of gray-tan soft brain
tissue admixed with sanguinous clot. No discrete
nodules are identified.
SECTION: 1-5 - submitted in toto.
COMMENT: The bulk of the specimen is brain parenchyma with
rarefaction, prominent glial reactive changes, extensive areas of
coagulation necrosis, and widespread vasculopathy.In addition, there
are a couple of small zones in which cellularity and nuclear atypia are
prominent and suggestive of neoplasm. However, a reactive change with
post-radiation atypia may not be completely excluded.
SPECIAL STAIN REPORT: Immunoperoxidase methods for GFAP and MIB-1 were
performed on sections from blocks 3 and 4.
The GFAP demonstrates that the great majority of astrocytes, although
atypical, have a reactive phenotype. There is mitotic activity that by
its distribution is most likely in lymphocytic/phagocytic cells.
Although isolated tumor cells cannot be ruled out, the process overall
does not appear neoplastic.

TEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA 
(baseline)/ Tumor DNA pairs using 3 markers at both 1p and 19q. The 3 markers 
on 1p are D1S548, D1S1592, and D1S552 (with 018468, D1S1612, and D1S496 as 
backup markers) and the 3 markers on 19q are D19S219, D19S412, and PLA2G4C 
(with D19S606 and D19S1182 as backup). All markers are microsatellites (2 or 4 
nt repeats) except PLA2G4C which is a minisatellite (26 nt repeat) 
polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score, 
arnplicon size, and ease of interpretation. The backup markers are used if the 
first line markers at that chromosome arm are uninformative or otherwise 
ambiguous in their interpretation. LOR at all informative loci on each 
chromosomal arm represents the typical finding in oligodendrogliomas with 1p 
and 19q deletion.

Microscopy:
Histological sections stained with H & E demonstrate partial brain parenchymal
infiltration by glial neoplasm composed of two cell populations of oligodendroglial and
astrocytic phenotype .The oligodendroglial component is represented by round nuclei
cells, delicate chromatin and inconspicuous nucleoli ,with scant cytoplasm. Such cells
infiltrate the adjacent neocortex ,in the form of isolated cells, forming small aggregates
around neurons (Neuronal satellitosis ).In some areas ,there is vacuolation of neuropil,
with formation of microcysts ,inbasophil -rich and mucinous matrix .The astrocytic
component ,less obvious ,is represented by cells of irregular nuclei ,dense chromatin
and eosinophilic cytoplasm ,with imprecise limits, infiltrating predominantly white
substance ,which shows areas with refractive neuropil and occasional reactive
astrocytes .Mitotic figures are rare in this material .Itwas not observed vessels with

CC .. ""NT 
Sections show an infiltrating glial tumor. Frequent mitotic figures are 
present as is necrosis. Tumor nuclei are mostly round to oval and many show 
nucleoli. In a few areas the cells more closely resemble neoplastic 
astrocytes. Other areas show mucinous pools or distinct microcystic 
architecture. The infiltrating tumor cells show prominent perineuronal 
satellitosis and perivascular spread. Some areas of the tumor show background 
ropy myelin. Many of these features are characteristic of oligodendroglial 
tumors. Occasional tumor cells are GFAP positive. GFAP positive reactive 
astrocytes are present. The tumor cells are CD20 and CD3 negative. NeuN 
highlights cortical neurons and perhaps a few tumor cell nuclei. Alcian blue is noncontributory. 
The tumor shows demonstrates moderate p53 staining and the Ki-67 labeling 
index is approximately 35%. 
This tumor shows distinct oligodendroglial and to a lesser extent astrocytic 
features, including astrocytic gemistocytes. The latter observation is 
complicated by the presence of numerous reactive astrocytes and some 
oligodendroglial mini-gemistocytes. 
The differential diagnosis includes anaplastic oligodendroglioma or anaplastic 
oligoastrocytoma (WHO Grade III) and glioblastoma wit 
component (WHO Grade IV). The patient's corresponding _t. • •• -,... _ 
slides were also reviewed. Clinical correlation is necessary. 
MGMT promoter methylation and EGFRvIII assays are pending and the results, 
which will be reported in procedure addenda, may help guide appropriate 
t~ 'py. 
Ipl9q LOH testing is recommended.

gray soft material. 
XI-X3 -representative of each piece. 
 
MICROSCOPIC: A,B. Portions of a glial neoplastic proliferation. The 
neoplastic cells have anaplastic elongated nuclei disposed in a heavy 
fibrillary background. There are occasional mitotic figures. There is 
capillary-type microvasculature with interanastomosing vessels, and 
focally there is microvascular cellular proliferation. There is no 
necrosis. 
SPECIAL STAINS: Immunoperoxidase methods for GFAP and MIB-1 were 
performed on sections from blocks #2 and x3. 
The GFAP demonstrates the glial fibrillary background of the 
tumor. With the MIB-1 labelling indices of 12% and 16% were 
determined 
in the more active areas. 
 COMMENT: The lesion is a glial neoplasm with heavy glial 
fibrillogenesis. The tumor cells have nuclear anaplastic features, 
mitotic figures are occasionally observed, and microvascular cellular 
proliferation is present focally. Necrosis is absent. The neoplasm 
is 
a high histological grade glioma (WHO grade IV/IV), however devoid of 
necrosis. The interanastomosing pattern of the microvasculature 
suggests an oligodendroglial component. 
ADDENDUM REPORT 
B. 
Tissue not previously submitted from this specimen is now submitted in 
total, #x4-x9. 
Microscopically, this tissue corresponds to brain diffusely and 
extensively infiltrated by a neoplastic proliferation similar to that 
one described above. In here, microvascular calcification and a 
microvascular network of vessels is more prominent. In a couple of 
microscopic areas there is tumor necrosis associated with 
microvascular 
cellular proliferation. 
The presence of microscopic zones of necrosis would justify the 
designation of this tumor as glioblastoma multiforme. Again, an 
oligodendroglial component is probable in this tumor. "," 1. ""Site"": Brain. Justified as the report specifically mentions the brain as the site.
2. ""Laterality"": Left. Justified as the report mentions ""Left temporal lobe"" as the location of the tumor.
3. ""Histology"": High grade glioma (WHO Grade IV). Justified as the report describes the tumor as a glial neoplasm with heavy glial fibrillogenesis, anaplastic nuclear features, mitotic figures, and microvascular cellular proliferation, leading to a high histological grade.
4. ""Stage"": Not provided. The TNM format requires information about the tumor size (T), lymph node involvement (N), and metastasis (M). The report does not provide enough information to determine these factors.

COMMENT 
In parts A and B there is a neoplastic glial proliferation that diffusely 
infiltrates and extensively effaces cerebral tissue, and has nuclear 
anaplasia, frequent mitoses, prominent microvascular cellular proliferation 
with vascular necrosis and thrombosis, and extensive areas of necrosis, some 
with pseudopalisading. In part B there is also a large zone that has a 
spindle cell configuration with nuclear anaplastic features. 
The neoplasm is a glioblastoma with focal sarcomatoid phenotype, i.e. a gliosarcoma. 
Part B is cerebral cortex and adjacent white matter in which there is one 
microscopic focal area that is sparsely infiltrated by naked neoplastic cells.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION One aspect 
with 
gray-white 
IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY: In part A, the GFAP demonstrates heavy 
gliofibrillogenesis by the neoplastic cells, including some ganglion-like 
cells. In part B, the GFAP depicts extensive spindle cell areas that are 
negative and intermingled with GFAP-positive strands. Only a small minority 
(about 5%) of cells over expresses the p53 protein. The CD163 marks a large 
number of cells, presumably phagocytic. With the MIB-1 there is a 
proliferation index of about 18% in the more active areas. 
SPECIAL STAIN: The Snook's reticulum demonstrates heavy reticulin deposition 
in the spindle, GFAP-negative areas. 
The stains results are consistent with a high histological grade glial 
neoplasm that has a sarcomatoid component.

PATHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS:
A,B. BRAIN, RIGHT TEMPORAL, EXCISION: ANAPLASTIC OLIGODENDROGLIOMA.
GRADE IV/IV. MIB-1 LABELLING INDEX 37%.
SEE MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION AND COMMENT.
------------------------------------------------------------
Operation/Specimen: Craniotomy, temporal lobe.
Clinical History and Pre-Op Dx:year old man with right temporal
lobe tumor.
GROSS PATHOLOGY: Received fresh, two fragments, 1.1 cm. across, in
aggregate. Soft, focally hemorrhagic and glistening. In total #1 and
2.
INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION: Brain, right temporal: Glioma, high
histological grade.
AskB.
SPECIMEN: Right temporal tumor - permanent.
FIXATIVE: Saline.
GENERAL: A 2.0 x 1.8 x 0.2 cm. aggregate of numerous, fragmented
tan-red soft tissue fragments and scanty blood clot.
SECTIONS: Xl,X2 - all submitted.
MICROSCOPIC: A. Portions of cerebrum effaced by a neoplastic
proliferation of glial cells. The neoplasm is very cellular and made
up of round or ovoid neoplastic nuclei with anaplastic features. The
background is fibrillary and has prominent microvascular cellular
proliferation. Mitotic figures are very frequent. There is individual
cell necrosis and areas of geographic tumor necrosis. At the periphery
of the tumor, neoplastic cells have perinuclear halos suggestive of an
oligodendroglial nature.
B. Portions of brain with a neoplasm similar to that one described for
part A. However, in this specimen there are zones of clearly
identifiable anaplastic oligodendroglioma, and extensive areas of
necrosis.
SPECIAL STAINS: Immunoperoxidase methods for GFAP and MIB-1 were
performed on block #2. The GFAP demonstrates a moderately fibrillary
background, and highlights the prominent microvascular cellular
proliferation. With the MIB-1 a labelling index of 37% is determined.
COMMENT: In this material there is a high histological grade glioma
that in less anaplastic areas has an oligodendroglial phenotype . The
neoplasm has prominent nuclear anaplasia, mitotic activity,
microvascular cellular proliferation, and areas of tumor necrosis,
namely a WHO grade IV/IV glioma. This tumor may also be diagnosed as a
glioblastoma multiforme with an oligodendroglial component. The
proliferation index is 37%. TISSUE COMMITTEE CODE: TC1.

CLINICAL HISTORY: 
Left parietal neoplasm 191.3. MRI Findings: Post gadolinium thin section 
imaging was obtained through the brain with fiducial markers in place for the 
purposes of preoperative localization. A peripherally enhancing mass in the 
left parietal region, with a broad contact against the dura is again seen, 
which is not significantly changed compared with prior outside MRI. There is 
mass effect results in effacement of the atrium and occipital horn of the left 
lateral ventricle, as Hell as partial effacement of the left ambient / 
quadrigeminal plate cistern by the posterior medial temporal lobe. This also 
remains unchanged. L01;'l Tl signal in the left parietal lobe is not 
significantly changed in distribution given differences in technique.

enhancing. 
OPERATIVE DIAGNOSES 
Left brain mass 
Operation/Specimen: A: Brain, left frontal tumor, biopsy 
B: Brain, left frontal tumor, excision 
PA'fHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS: 
A and B. Brain! left frontal, excisional biopsy and excision: 
Glioblastoma 
(WHO IV). 
See Microscopy Description and Comment. 
COMMENT 
The specimen is portions of cerebrum that are extensively and 
moderately to 
heavily infiltrated by a glial neoplastic proliferation. The 
neoplastic cells 
tend to have round or oval nuclei, and focally have a gemistocytic 
phenotype. 
Focally there is nuclear anaplasia and some mitotic activity, with a 
MIB-l 
proliferation index of 5% to 7% in the more active areas. There is 
neovascularization throughout the tumor. Focally, there is also 
microvascular 
cellular proliferation with karyorrhexis t and one microscopic area of 
tumor necrosis with pseudopalisading.  tumor necrosis with pseudopalisading. 
The neoplasm is a high histological grade astrocytoma, perhaps with an 
oligodendroglial component. The larger portion of the neoplasm has an 
anaplastic phenotype; however, focally it has features of a 
glioblastoma: 
microvascular cellular proliferation and tumor necrosis. 
The tumor does not have Ip, 19q LOH (see Report below). 
======================================================================= 
PROCEDURES/ADDENDA 
Loss of Het.ero~lP' 
Date Ordered: 11IIIIIIII 
Interpretation 19q Assay (LOH) 
Date Reported: 
NEGATIVE: Allelic loss on chromosome arm 1p and chromosome arm 19q is 
NOT 
detected. 
Informative loci are: D1S548, D1S552, D19S219 and D19S412 
Results-Comments 
Testing was performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block 
DNA extracted from a corresponding blood specimen was used as a normal 
reference control. 
H slide was examined and no microdissection was 
needed. 
TEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA 
(baseline)/ Tumor DNA pairs using 3 markers at both 1p and 19q. The 3 
markers 
on 1p are D1S548, D1S1592, and D1S552 (with D1S468, D1S1612, and 
D18496 as 
backup markers) and the 3 markers on 19q are D19S219, D198412, and 
PLA2G4C 
(with D198606 and D1981182 as backup). All markers are microsatellites 
(2 or 4 
nt repeats) except PLA2G4C which is a minisatellite (26 nt repeat) 
polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score, 
amplicon size, and ease of interpretation. The backup markers are used 
if the 
first line markers at that chromosome arm are uninformative or 
otherwise 
ambiguous in their interpretation. LOH at all informative loci on each 
chromosomal arm represents the typical finding in oligodendrogliomas 
with 1p 
and 19q deletion.  FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results 
from a 
stand-alone diagnostic test. This test was developed and its 
performance 
characteristics determined by the laboratory as 
required by CLIA ' III regulations. It has not been cleared or approved 
for 
specific uses by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA 
has 
determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These 
results are 
provided for informational purposes only, and should be interpreted 
only in 
the context of established procedures and/or diagnostic criteria. 
TECHNICAL SENSITIVITY: The presence of >15% non-neoplastic cells in 
the sample 
may preclude the detection of allelic loss. 
Interpretation 
NEGATIVE: No evidence of methylated MGMT promoter is detected. 
Results-Comments 
Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block 
H slide was examined and no microdissection was 
needed. 
TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT 
promoter 
have been shown to benefit from therapy with alkylating agents. 
Assessment of 
MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite treatment of DNA 
followed 
by real-time PCR amplification (MethyLight) of methylated and 
unmethylated DNA 
sequences. The analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by 
serial 
dilution of methylated positive control DNA into unmethylated DNA, and 
was 
assessed to be 1% of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated 
DNA. 
Factors such as the presence of >50% non-neoplastic cells in the 
sample, or 
extensive tissue necrosis, may preclude the detection of methylated 
MGMT 
promoter sequences.  FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results 
from a 
stand alone diagnostic test. -This test was developed and its

Macroscopy:
Multiple irregular pieces of brown-gray and soft tissue, measuring together 2.6 x 2.0 x
1.0 cm.
Microscopy:
The histological sections exhibit malignancy with moderate cellularity composed of cells
with glial phenotype arranged in matrix something fibrillar. The neoplastic cells exhibit
moderate atypia and pleomorphism. Have oval nuclei, evenly distributed chromatin and
inconspicuous nucleoli. Many cells show a clear cytoplasm. In areas of high cellularity,
cells tend to have more irregular nuclei and dense chromatin. It is note the multiple foci
of dystrophic calcification in middle of the lesion. The vasculature consists of abundant
and branched capillaries. Some vessels show foci of endothelial proliferation. We
observed occasional mitotic figures, including atypical figures, especially in areas of
high cell density .There are no areas of necrosis.
Diagnosis:
Biopsy product of lesion in the left insula:
-Anaplastic oligodendroglioma (grade III-WHO, 2007). ICD-O 9451/3 - see note.
NOTES:
-The presence of heterogeneous areas in the lesion raised the possibility of
progression from low-grade oligodendroglioma (grade II) to anaplastic
oligodendroglioma (grade III).

COMMENT strokes, 
and 
In all the specimens there is a glial neoplastic proliferation that 
extensively infiltrates and focally effaces the cerebral tissue. The neoplasm 
has anaplastic features, i.e. nuclear atypia, mitotic activity, microvascular 
cellular proliferation, and zones of necrosis with vascular thrombosis. 
Focally, the tumor has extensively infiltrated the leptomeningeal space. 
The neoplasm has a predominantly astrocytic phenotype, but in some 
infiltrative areas there is a capillary vascular network with focal 
mineralization. This feature suggests an oligodendroglial component. 
This neoplasm may probably be better classified as a glioblastoma, Hith 
possibly an oligodendroglial component (WHO IV/IV). 
The neoplasm is present in all specimens. In specimen D (llposteriorll), the 
tumor is only moderately cellular and is devoid of necrosis. 
Molecular-genetic data may better characterize this tumor.

TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT promoter 
have been shown to benefit from therapy with alkylating agents. Assessment of 
MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite treatment of DNA followed 
by real-time PCR amplification (MethyLight) of methylated and unmethylated DNA 
sequences.

required by CLIA ' • regulations. or approved for 
specific uses by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA has 
determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These results are 
provided for informational purposes only, and should be interpreted only in 
the context of established procedures and/or diagnostic criteria. 
NEGATIVE: Allelic loss on chromosome arm lp and chromosome arm 19q is NOT 
detected.

PLA2G4C, D19S606, D19S1l82 
Results-Comments 
Test performed on paraffin tumor block . and peripheral blood for 
germline comparison. 
TEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA 
(baseline)/ Tumor DNA pairs using 3 markers at both Ip and 19q. The 3 markers 
on Ip are D1S548, D1S1592, and D1S552 (with D1S468, D1S1612, and D1S496 as 
backup markers) and the 3 markers on 19q are D19S219, D19S412, and PLA2G4C 
(with D19S606 and D19S1182. as backup). All markers are microsatellites (2 or 4 
nt repeats) except PLA2G4C vThich is a minisatellite (26 nt repeat) 
polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score, 
amplicon size, and ease of interpretation. The backup markers are used if the 
first line markers at that chromosome arm are uninformative or otherwise 
ambiguous in their interpretation. LOH at all informative loci on each 
chromosomal arm represents the typical finding in oligodendrogliomas with Ip 
and 19q deletion. 
FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a 
stand-alone diagnostic test. This its performance

Specimen labelled ""Brain tumour"", consists of multiple pieces of light grey tissue which
range in size between 1-15mm in maximum dimension with an aggregate measurement
of 22 x 20 x 8mm. AE 1 block.It
MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by
The sections show an infiltrative tumour with adjacent non-neoplastic brain. The tumour
is hypercellular and is composed of a diffuse infiltrate of cells with predominantly round to
slightly irregular nuclei with a surrounding pale zone of perinuclear clearing. Occasional
mini gemistocytic cells are seen .The tumour contains a delicate ramifying vasculature.
Larger calibre blood vessels are also present within the tumour, however, endothelial
proliferation is not identified. Mitoses are frequent and are easily identified. There is a
small focus of likely necrosis. The tumour cells are negative for GFAP. The Ki67
proliferative index is focally up to approximately 10%.
COMMENT:
The right insular tumour is an oligodendroglioma. The grading of oligodendrogliomas is
difficult as definite criteria for the designation of anaplastic oligodendroglioma (Grade 3,
WHO 2007) are not. precisely established. Nonetheless, the presence of readily
identifiable mitoses in this case, accompanied by a microscopic focus of necrosis and an
elevated Ki67 proliferative index are worrying for progression to an anaplastic
oligodendroglioma despite absence of microvascular proliferation. Testing for loss of
heterozygosity at 1 p/1 9q is also suggested.

1, Malignant astrocytoma. 
2. NIB-1 proliferation index: 35%. 
See Microscopy Description and Comment. 
COMMENT 
The tumor is a very cellular neoplastic proliferation of glial cells. 
The 
neoplastic cells have a predominant small astrocytic phenotype. There 
is 
focal brisk mitotic activity1 and the MIB-1 proliferation index is 
high at 
about 35%. There is not obvious microvascular cellular proliferation 
(only a 
few abnormal vessels on the smears) or necrosis. 
The tumor is a high histological grade astrocytic neoplasm. Although 
there is 
not overt microvascular cellular proliferation and/or tumor necrosis1 
the 
neoplasm's high cellularity1 brisk mitotic activity and elevated MIB-1 
proliferation index portend an aggressive behavior1 probably more akin 
to a 
glioblastoma than to an anaplastic astrocytoma. 
 The morphological features may be correlated with clinical1 imaging 
and 
Operative fi~dings and molecular testing results for their final 
interpretation and patient's follow up.

TEST DESCRIPTION: Testing performed on RNA extracted from tumor 
paraffin block 
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR} is an attractive molecular 
target 
in glioblastoma because it is amplified1 overexpressed1 and/or mutated 
in up 
to 40% to 50~ of patients. Epidermal growth factor receptor variant 
III 
{EGFRviii) is an oncogenic1 constitutively active mutant form of EGFR 
that is 
commonly expressed in glioblastoma. Cell culture and in vivo models of 
glioblastoma have demonstrated EGFRviii as defining prognostically 
distinct 
subgr.oups .of gli.oblast.omas. Additi.onally, the presence of EGFRviii has 
been 
shown to sensitize tumors to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors when the 
tumor 
suppressor protein PTEN is intact. RNA is extracted from formalin 
fixed1 
paraffin embedded tissue samples and reverse transcribed to eDNA. The 
eDNA is 
then amplified using standard PCR technique for DNA templates. PCR 
products 
are detected by gel electrophoresis. The limit of detection of this 
assay has 
been determined to be approximately 5 mutant cells in 100 normal 
cells.

between laminin-8 and glial tumor grade, recurrence, and patient survival. 
Accordingly, low expression ofP I and ~2 in this tumor suggests a more favorable prognosis.

Histology: The histology is consistent with a diagnosis of glioblastoma, based on the operative call and surgical pathology report.
Stage: Not provided in the report
Grade: Based on the description of the specimen as a ""glioblastoma"" in the operative call and surgical pathology report, I would assign a grade of IV, which is the highest grade for gliomas and indicates the most aggressive behavior.
Behavior: The behavior of this tumor is typically aggressive, with a poor prognosis despite treatment. This is supported by the histology diagnosis of glioblastoma, which carries a very poor prognosis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

INTERPRETATIONStatus :Signed Out
1p intact: A majority of nuclei showed similar numbers of 1p36 and 1q25 signals.
There is no evidence of allelic loss on the short arm of chromosome 1 (1 p).
19q intact: A majority of nuclei showed similar numbers of 19g13 and 19p13 signals.
There is no evidence of allelic loss of 19q.
Allelic loss at one locus does not necessarily predict the presence of alterations at
other loci on the same chromosome, i.e. FISH may not detect partial allelic loss. FISH
may not detect allelic losses if there is loss of one allele and replication on the other
allele.
Comment: Allelic loss on chromosome 1 p has been shown to correlate with
chemoresponsiveness and long progression-free survival in some gliomas. This
correlation is stronger when there is concomitant allelic loss on 19q. An association of
chemoresponsiveness and/or long progression-free survival with allelic loss on 19q in
the absence of loss on 1 p has not been established. In patients with 1 p/19q loss,
aneusomy for chromosome 1 and 19 may be associated with earlier recurrence.

Procedure :FISH for EGFR
Text :""`* EGFR FISH RESULTS
RESULTS: EGFR NOT AMPLIFIED
SPECIMEN SUBMITTED: Paraffin block 82Status :Signed Out
Interpretation : Amplification of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor gene (EGFR)
was evaluated with interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on formalin-
fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using EGFR (7p12) and chromosome 7
paracentromeric (7p11.1-911.1) (CEP7) locus specific directly labeled probes
The following FISH results were obtained:
EGFR 2.8
CEP7 2.7
EGFR/CEP7 ratio 1.0
Aneusomy of chromosome 7 is not identified,
Comment: There is some indication in the literature that EGFR amplification may
correlate with survival and prognosis in some patients with gliomas (Smith JS, et al., J
Natl Canc Inst 93:1246-1256, 2001; [no et al., J Neurosurgery 92:983-990 2000).

Intraoperative Diagnosis:
A. Low grade glioma
Clinical Diagnosis:
LEFT FRONTAL BRAIN TUMOR
Gross Description:
A. Received fresh on gauze for frozen consultation labeled ""left frontal brain mass"" are two fragments of
white-tan tissue aggregating to 0.5 x 0.2 x 0.1 cm. Half of the specimen is submitted as FSA1. The
remainder of the specimen is totally submitted for permanent evaluation as A2.
B.Received fresh labeled ""left frontal brain tumor"" are three irregular shaped segments of tan-white soft
and rubbery tissue aggregating to 2.5 x 2.0 x 2.0 cm and weighing 6. 9 grams .Upon sectioning, a tan-
white mottled, smooth and glistening cut surface is identified. The segments are totally submitted in
formalin in 8183.
Microscopic:
(Not Entered)
Page 4 or 4"," Site: Left frontal brain
Laterality: Left
Histology: Low grade glioma
Stage: Not provided (as this is a pathological term typically used in cancer staging systems and not applicable to low grade gliomas)
Grade: Low grade
Behavior: Not provided (as behavior is typically not assigned to low grade gliomas, which are by definition slow-growing tumors)

Justification for choices:

Site: The specimen is labeled as ""left frontal brain mass"" and ""left frontal brain tumor,"" indicating that the tumor is located in the left frontal lobe of the brain.

Laterality: The tumor is located in the left side of the brain, as indicated by the labels on the specimen.

Histology: The intraoperative diagnosis is ""low grade glioma,"" which refers to a slow-growing tumor that arises from glial cells in the brain.

Stage: No information is provided about the extent of the tumor or its spread beyond the site of origin, so staging cannot be determined.

Grade: The tumor is described as ""low grade,"" indicating that it is a slow-growing tumor with relatively well-differentiated cells and a better prognosis than higher grade gliomas.

Behavior: Low grade gliomas are by definition slow-growing tumors, so behavior is not typically assigned to them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CLINICAL HISTORY:
yo who presents with episodes where she does not know where her left arm
is, as well as fluttering of the left side of her face.
MRI: There is a large predominantly T2 hyperintense mass,
which involves the majority of the right posterior parietal lobe extending
across the callosal splenium into the left parietal white matter as well as
down to the subependymal surface of the right lateral ventricle atria and
occipital horn. This mass demonstrates subtle heterogeneous enhance mentalong
its anterior and lateral border. This enhancement was not well demonstrated on
the outside MRI of the brain, which may be secondary to interval development
versus technique. The mass are grossly measures 7 cm AP x 4.1 cm transverse
(image 35 series 4). There is stable mild mass effect and effacement of the
right lateral ventricle posteriorly. The exam is otherwise stable.
GROSS EXAMINATION:
A. ""Brain tissue (AK)"", received fresh for frozen section. A 1 x 0.2 x 0.1
cm aggregate of yellow-tan tissue is received. Representative has been
previously submitted as frozen section AF1. The frozen section remnant is
submitted in Al. The remaining nonfrozen tissue is submitted in A2.
B. ""Brain tissue (BFI)"", received fresh for frozen section. A 4.1 x 4 x 2 cm
fragment of soft red tissue is received. Representative has been previously
submitted as frozen section BF1. The frozen sections are submitted in Bl,
multiple additional sections are submitted in B2-B5.

Justification: The diagnosis is based on the histological examination of the craniotomy sample, which revealed features consistent with anaplastic astrocytoma (WHO Grade III). The presence of subarachnoid accumulations of tumor cells in part B supports this diagnosis. Additionally, FISH analysis showed 2 out of 4 abnormal markers and 9p21 loss, which are associated with a lower hazard of short survival.

CLINICAL HISTORY: 
Right parietal brain tumor. Visual hallucinations and headaches. 
Preoperative MRI: MRI for surgical localization purposes redemonstrating right 
temporal peripherally enhancing mass with several additional areas of 
enhancement adjacent to the dominant mass. 
GROSS EXAMINATION: 
A. ""Brain tissue {AFl)"", received fresh for frozen section. Previously 
submitted as frozen section AFl is a 2 x 2 x 0.3 em aggregate of soft brown 
tissue and a blue tissue paper that is entirely submitted in block Al. 
Representative sections are submitted in a blue tissue paper in blocks A2-3 
with a small portion of the tissue remaining in the container. 
B. ""Brain tissue"", received fresh and placed in formalin is a 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.2

submitted in block B1 a small portion of tissue remains in the container. 
    
INTRA OPERATIVE CONSULTATION: 
A. ""Brain tissue"" :AF1-glioblastoma   
MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION: 
Microscopic examination shows brain infiltrated by a malignant astrocytic 
neoplasm characterized by cytologic pleomorphism, mitotic figures, 
microvascular changes and pseudopalisading necrosis. In some areas, many 
macrophages are seen, and there are increased numbers of granular mitoses. An 
LFB stain is non-contributory. 
IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL FINDINGS: 
An immunohistochemical stain for Ki-67 shows a proliferation index of 
approximately 5%-10%. GFAP highlights the tumor cells. Ham56 highlights the 
numerous macrophages. NFP show preserved axons within foci of increased 
numbers of macrophages. 
DIAGNOSIS: 
A. ""BRAIN TISSUE"" (CRANIOTOMY): 
GLIOBLASTOMA (WHO GRADE IV). SEE COMMENT. 
B. ""BRAIN TISSUE"" (CRANIOTOMY): 
HIGH-GRADE ASTROCYTOMA. SEE COMMENT. 
COMMENT: In some areas there are prominent macrophage infiltrates associated 
with axonal preservation and granular mitoses. Histologically, these features 
raise the possibility of coexisting demyelinating disease. While the 
simultaneous detection of glioblastoma and mutiple sclerosis is exceptionally 
rare (   I would recommend 
clinical correlation to exclude the possibility.

Comment: 
Immunohistochemistry for the proliferation antigen Ki67 is pending and 
when completed, an addendum will be issued. 
 
This diagnostic report has been personally interpreted by the signatory 
of record. 
Addendum 
Immunohistochemistry for the proliferation antigen Ki67 demonstrates 
less than 1% labeling of tumor cell nuclei. 
The proliferation index is within the expected range for a grade II 
astrocytoma (WHO scale). 
: 
 
Microscopic Description: 
The tumor consists of a diffusely infiltrative proliferation of 
moderately pleomorphic astrocytes. There is no endothelial 
proliferation or necrosis. No mitoses were identified. In some areas, 
particularly near the pial surface, there are clusters of Rosenthal 
fibers. However, there are no other histologic features to suggest a 
pilocytio astrocytoma.

PATHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS: 
Brain, left parietal, excisional biopsies: 
1. Glioblastoma. 
2. MIB-l proliferation index: 35%. 
See Microscopy Description and Comment. 
COMMENT 
The neoplasm is a very cellular glial neoplastic proliferation of mostly naked 
nuclei with irregular contours. The neoplasm has brisk mitotic activity and a 
high proliferation index of about 35%. The tumor has focal microvascular 
cellular proliferation and tumor necrosis. Focally there is an arciform 
capillary-type vascular network and very sparse microcalcification. 
The neoplasm has histological features of glioblastoma. Molecular testing to 
rule out the possibility of an oligodendroglial component is being performed, 
and the result will be reported as an addendum.

NEGATIVE -No evidence of EGFRvIII mutation is detected 
Results-Comments 
TEST DESCRIPTION: Testing performed on RNA extracted from tumor paraffin block 
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an attractive molecular target 
in glioblastoma because it is amplified, overexpressed, and/or mutated in up 
to 40% to 50% of patients. Epidermal growth factor receptor variant III 
(EGFRvIII) is an oncogenic, constitutively active mutant form of EGFR that is 
commonly expressed in glioblastoma. Cell culture and in vivo models of 
glioblastoma have demonstrated EGFRvIII as defining prognostically distinct 
subgroups of glioblastomas. Additionally, the presence of EGFRvIll has been 
sh0\1n to sensitize tumors to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors when the tumor 
suppressor protein PTEN is intact. RNA is extracted from formalin fixed, 
paraffin embedded tissue samples and reverse transcribed to cDNA. The cDNA is 
then amplified using standard PCR technique for DNA templates. PCR products 
~re detected by gel electrophoresis. The limit of detection of this assay has 
len determined to be approximately 5 mutant cells in 100 normal cells. 
FDA Comment: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a 
stand alone diagnostic test. This performance

required by CLlA 'lilregulations. or approved for

determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These results are

CLINICAL HISTORY 
 Right frontal brain tumor. 
OPERATIVE DIAGNOSES 
Operation/Specimen.: A: Right frontal brain, excision biopsy 
B: Right frontal brain, excision biopsy 
PATHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS: 
A. B. Brain, right frontal tumor, excision biopsy: Anaplastic 
oligoastrocytoma (WHO Grade III) (see cormnent). 
COMMENT 
Permanent sections confirm the frozen section diagnosis, with the 
exception of 
the tumor grade. The sections show a moderately cellular infiltrative 
neoplasm. Mucin-filled microcystic spaces are seen focally. The tumor 
cells 
mostly show oval to round nuclei, however some irregular and angulated 
forms 
are present. Numerous mini-gemistocytes and some astrocytic 
gemistocytes ~re 
pre~ent. Mild to moderate nuclear pleomorphism is seen, \•lith a mitotic 
count 
of up to 2 to 3 per ten HPFs in areas of dense cellularity. Frequent 
apoptotic 
bodies are noted. No definite microvascular proliferation or areas of 
necrosis 
are seen. p53 shows moderate positivity in 50% of the tumor cells, 
\<Ihereas EMA 
is mostly negative. The Ki-67 labeling index is focally increased to 
approximately 15~. 
Positive and negative controls show appropriate immunoreactivity. 
MGMT promoter methylation is detected, and complete LOH for 1p/19q is 
not 
detected (see procedure addenda beloc1) . 
 The tumor shows mixed oligodendroglial/astrocytic cytology, but 
appears 
primarily ol~godendroglial.

MGMT Promoter Methylation 
Date Ordered,.  Date Reported: 
POSITIVE: Methylated MGMT promoter is detected. 
Results-Comments  
Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block 
H stained slide was examined by a pathologist for 
subsequent tumor 
dissection. Sufficient tumor cells were present in the tissue block 
and .-no 
microdissection was needed. 
TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT 
promoter 
have been shown to benefit from therapy with alkylating agents. 
Assessment of 
MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite treatment of DNA 
followed 
by real-time PCR amplification (MethyLight) of methylated and 
unmethylated DNA 
sequences. The analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by 
serial 
dilution of methylated positive control DNA into unmethylated DNA, and 
was 
assessed to be 1~ of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated 
DNA. 
Factors such~·as. the presence of >50% non-neoplastic cells in the 
sample1 or 
~xtensive tissue necrosis1 may preclude the detection of methylated 
MGMT 
promoter sequences.

Results-Comments 
Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block. 
DNA extracted from a corresponding blood specimen was used as normal 
reference 
control. 
HStained slide was examined for subsequent tumor 
dissection. Sufficient 
tumor cells were present in the tissue block and no microdissection 
was 
needed. 
TEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA 
{baseline)/ Tumor DNA pairs using 3 markers at both lp and 19q. The 3 
markers 
onlp are DlS548, DlS1592, and DlS552 {with DlS468, DlS1612, and 
DlS496  
backup markers) and the 3 markers on 19q are Dl9S219, Dl9S412, and 
PLA2G4C 
{with Dl9S606 and Dl9Sll82 as backup) . All markers are microsatellites 
{2 or 4 
nt repeats) except PLA2G4C which is a minisatellite {26 nt repeat) 
polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score, 
.amplicon size, and ease of interpretation. The backup markers are used 
if, the 
first line markei-s at that chromosome arm are uninformative or 
otherwise 
ambiguous in their interpretation. LOH at all informative loci on each 
chromosomal arm represents the typical finding in oligodendrogliomas 
with lp 
and 19q deletion.

Comment
Permanent sections confirm the frozen section diagnosis. Sections show a moderately pleomorphic
infiltrating glioma
with mostly angular and irregular hyperchromatic nuclei. Some rounder nuclei are also present perhaps
suggesting a
minor oligodendroglial component. Mitotic activity is increased in areas of high cellular density (slide A2).
The Ki-67 labeling index is approximately 10% overall but focally approaches approximately 45%. An
experimental
antibody for the R1 32H IDHI mutation Is positive. Controls show appropriate reactivity.
Results of additional studies will be reported below in procedure addenda.

PCR for EGFR variant III mutation
Date Ordered : Date Reported:
Interpretation
NEGATIVE - No evidence of EGFRvIII mutation is detected
Surgical Pathology
Results-Comments
TEST DESCRIPTION: Testing performed on RNA extracted from paraffin tissue block
H and E slide was examined and no microdissection was needed.
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR )is an attractive molecular target in glioblastoma because it
is amplified,
overexpressed ,and/or mutated in up to 40 %to 50% of patients .Epidermal growth factor receptor variant
III
(EGFRvIII )is an oncogenic ,constitutively active mutant form of EGFR that is commonly expressed in
glioblastoma.
Cell culture and in vivo models of glioblastoma have demonstrated EGFRvlII as defining prognostically
distinct
subgroups of glioblastomas .Additionally, the presence of EGFRvIII has been shown to sensitize tumors
to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors when the tumor suppressor protein PTEN is intact. RNA is extracted from
formalin fixed,
paraffin embedded tissue samples and reverse transcribed to cDNA .The cDNA is then amplified using
standard PCR
technique for DNA templates .PCR products are detected by gel electrophoresis .The limit of detection of
this assay
has been determined to be approximately 5 mutant cells in 100 normal cells.
FDA Comment :The above data are not to be construed as the results from a stand alone diagnostic test.
This test

ease of
interpretation .The backup markers are used if the first line markers at that chromosome arm are
uninformative or
otherwise ambiguous in their interpretation .LOH at all informative loci on each chromosomal arm
represents the

CLINICAL HISTORY 
 
lower 
extremities weakness, and more . On 
imaging, 
there is a 2.3 em patchy, irregularly enhancing lesion involving the 
white 
matter at the level of the atrium and posterior body of the lateral 
vent.ricle/ 
and·extending to the right paramedian parietal lobe. The lesion has 
been 
enlarging recently. 
OPERATIVE DIAGNOSES 
Brain tumor 
Operation/Specimen: A: Brain, right parietal lesion, biopsy 
B: Brain, ri~ht parietal lesion, biopsy 
PATHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS: 
A and B. Brain; right parietal, excisional biopsies: 
1. ·Astrocytoma, anaplastic (viHO III). 
2. MIB-1 proliferation index: > 10%. 
See Microscopy Description and Comment. 
COMMENT 
The specimens are cerebral cortex and adjacent white matter in which 
there is 
extensive cautery artefact. The brain tissues are diffusely and 
sparsely .to 
moderately infiltrated by an astrocytic neoplastic proliferation. 
There are 
no nuclear anaplastic features. There are a handful of mitotic 
figures and 
the MIB-1 proliferation index is higher than 10%. There is no 
microvascular 
cellular proliferation or tumor necrosis. 
 The neoplasm is an astrocytoma that infiltrates diffusely the brain 
parenchyma 
and·has mitotic figures, in the absence of microvascular cellular 
proliferation or tumor necrosis, i.e. an anaplastic astrocytoma.

Loss of Heterozygosity 1p, 19q Assay
Dat.e Ordered:  Date Reported: 
Interpretation  
·POSITIVE: Allelic loss and chromosome arm 19q is detected. 
There is par~ial deletion on chromosome arm lp as evidenced by LOH at 
only 
D1S496 locus 
Informative· loci are: D1S548, D1S552, D1S496, D19S219, D19S412, and 
PLA2G4C 
Results-Comments 
Test performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block and 
peripheral blood for germline comparison. 
TEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA 
(baseline)/ Tumor DNA pairs using 3 markers at both 1p and 19q. The 3 
markers 
on 1p are D1S548, D1S1592, and D1S552 (with D1S468, D1Sl612, and 
D1S496 as 
backup markers) and the 3 markers on 19q are D19S219, D19S412, and 
PLA2G4C 
(viith D19S606 and D19Sll82 as backup). All markers are microsatellites 
(2 or 4 
nt repeats) except PLA2G4C which is a minisatellite (26 nt repeat) 
polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score, 
amplicon size, and ease of interpretation. The backup markers are used 
if the 
first line markers at that chromosome arm are uninformative or 
otherwise 
. ambiguous in··their interpretation. LOH at all informative loci on each 
chromosomal arm represents the typical finding in oligodendrogliomas 
with 1p · 
and 19q deletion. 
FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results 
from ·a 
stand-alone diagnostiC test. This test was developed and its 
performance 
characterist~cs determined by the  laboratory as 
 required by . It has not been cleared or approved 
for 
specific uses by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA 
has 
de.termined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These 
results are 
provided for·informat~onal purposes only, and should be interpreted 
only in

GENERAL: Recei ved is a 1. 5 x 1 x 0.8 cm gray-\.hi te rubbery tissue fragment. 
SECTIONS: The specimen is sectioned and submitted entirely in cassette Bl. 
MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION 
Sections of specimens A and B show a histologically complex neoplasm 
consisting of pleomorphic atypical cells. Many tumor cells are spindle-shaped 
and arranged in streaming fascicles. Other areas show whorl formation. 
Epithelioid tumor cells with moderately abundant cytoplasm are also present. 
Mitotic figures are frequent. Both focal and geographic necrosis is present. 
Immunostains performed on sections from block Bl reveal that many tumor cells 
are vimentin immunopositive. Many areas of the tumor are GFAP irnmunopositive, 
particularly islands of tumor cells which are less spindle-shaped. Focal 
pan-cytokeratin (CK) positivity, and patchy muscle-specific actin positivity 
of tumor spindle cells is noted. The tumor is negative for CK7, CK20, TTFI and 
HMB45.

mitotic figures which were not identified previously. However, their  number never 
exceeds 2 per 10 high power fields and is not sufficient to warrant classification as anaplastic.

Comment
Part A.
This specimen is portions of cerebrum that are moderately infiltrated by a glial neoplastic proliferation that
has a
mixed oligo astrocytic phenotype, with uniform round/ovoid nuclei frequently surrounded by halos.
However, the
neoplastic cells are devoid of the 1 p, 19q deletion characteristic of oligodendrogliomas. Mitotic figures are
found with
great difficulty, and there is not microvascular proliferation or tumor necrosis. The MIB-1 proliferation
index is greater
than 9% (as normal native cells are entered in the total nuclear count; the index is probably no more than
15%).
The findings are interpreted as those of a low histological grade glial neoplasm that has molecular
features of
astrocytoma. The elevated cycling activity may portend a heightened aggressive potential.
Part B.
Surgical PathologyPage 2 of 4
This specimen is three small fragments of cerebral cortex in which, because of the small size and
orientation of the
fragments, it is difficult to evaluate the cortical architectural features. Furthermore, the IDH1 stain
demonstrates a9goc13 somewhat sparse sprinkling of the cortex by neoplastic glial cells, which interferes even more with
evaluation of the
distribution of normal cells. There is not obvious architectural distortion, dysmorphic neuronal element, or
balloon
cells.
The findings are interpreted as a glial neoplasm sparsely infiltrating the cerebral cortex; and non
conclusive of cortical
dysplasia
The features in both specimens may be correlated with clinical, imaging, electrophysiological, and
operative findings
for their interpretation and patient's follow up.

Loss of Heterozygosity 1 p, 19q Assay (LOH)
Date Ordered: Date Reported:
Interpretation
NEGATIVE: Allelic loss on chromosome arm 1 p and chromosome arm 19q is NOT detected.
Informative loci are: D1S1592, D1S552, D19S412, D19S606, D19S1182 and PLA2G4C
Results -Comments
Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block (Al). DNA extracted from a
corresponding blood specimen was used as a normal reference control.
H and E slide was examined and no microdissection was needed.
TEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA (baseline )/ Tumor DNA
pairs using 3
markers at both 1 p and 19q. The 3 markers on 1 p are DI S548, D1 S1592, and D1 S552 (with D1 S468,
D1S1612, and
D1 S496 as backup markers) and the 3 markers on 19q are D19S219, D19S412, and PLA2G4C (with
D19S606 and
D19S1182 as backup). All markers are microsatellites (2 or 4 nt repeats )except PLA2G4C which is a
minisatellite (26
nt repeat) polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score, amplicon size, and
ease of
interpretation. The backup markers are used if the first line markers at that chromosome arm are
uninformative or
otherwise ambiguous in their interpretation. LOH at all informative loci on each chromosomal arm
represents the
typical finding in oligodendrogliomas with 1 p and 19q deletion.
FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a stand-alone diagnostic
test. This test
was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the
as required
by CLIA' 88 regulations. It has not been cleared or approved for specific uses by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA). The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These
results are
provided for informational purposes only, and should be interpreted only in the context of established
procedures
and/or diagnostic criteria.
TECHNICAL SENSITIVITY: The presence of X15% non-neoplastic cells in the sample may preclude the
detection of
allelic loss.

Date Ordered : Date Reported:
Interpretation
LOW POSITIVE: Methylated MGMT promoter is detected.
Results -Comments
Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block (Al)
H and E slide was examined and no microdissection was needed.
TEST DESCRIPTION :Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT promoter have been shown to
benefit
from therapy with alkylating agents .Assessment of MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite
treatment of
DNA followed by real-time PCR amplification of methylated and unmethylated DNA
sequences. The
analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by serial dilution of methylated positive control DNA into
unmethylated DNA, and was assessed to be 1 % of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated
DNA. Factors
such as the presence of >50 %non-neoplastic cells in the sample ,or extensive tissue necrosis, may
preclude the
detection of methylated MGMT promoter sequences.
FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a stand alone diagnostic
test. This test

IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY:
Part A :The GFAP demonstrates a rather delicate gliofibrillary background. The tumor cells are heavily
and
uniformly reactive with IDH1. With the MIB-1 there is a proliferation index of more than 9%, since the
normal native
nuclei are included in the total cell count.
Surgical PathologyPage 4 of 4
Part B :The iDH1 evinces a sparse sprinkling of positive glial neoplastic nuclei sprinkled throughout the
cerebral
cortex. The GFAP demonstrates absence of reactive astrocytes. The CD163 depicts slight dendritic
microglial
unrest, probably associated with previous mechanical manipulation. The NeuN and NFP highlight a thin,
tangentionally sectioned cerebral cortex that overall has reasonable well preserved layering, without overt
disorganization or dysmorphism.

B. Portions of cerebral and subjacent white matter extensively 
infiltrated by glial neoplasm with predominantly round, but also 
elongated nuclei in a fine fibrillary background. 
C. Portions of white matter infiltrated by predominantly naked, 
elongated neoplastic nuclei. 
D. Portions of a moderate-to-highly cellular glial neoplasm with 
prominent nuclear pleomorphism and made up of cells with gemistocytic 
features in a prominent fibrillary background. Interspersed between 
the gemistocytics, there are numerous anaplastic looking naked nuclei. 
Mitotic figures and occasional individual cells necrosis are observed. 
There are no areas of necrosis or vascular endothelial proliferation. 
E. Portions of glial neoplasm with cellular features similar to those 
described for part D. However, in focal areas, there is a fine 
capillary network in the background, and focally these cells exhibit 
perinuclear halos resembling anaplastic oligodendrocytes. There are 
no areas of necrosis and vascular endothelial microcellular 
proliferation are not observed. 
SPECIAL STAINS: Immunoperoxidase stain for GFAP and MIB-1 antigens 
were performed on block #5. The GFAP demonstrates the macro and mini 
gemistocytic phenotype of the tumor cells. With the MIB-1a labelling 
index of about 2% is determined. 
COMMENT: The neoplasm is a glioma with features of anaplasia. There 
are focal areas of anaplastic gernistocytic astrocytoma; in other 
smaller focal areas, the neoplasm has features of anaplastic 
oligodendroglioma interspersed with neoplastic astrocytes (hybrid 
tumor). Although the MIB-1 labelling index is about 2%, the 
cellularity, degree of anaplasia, and mitoses justify the grade III/IV 
classification.

Comments
The resultant FISH section/slide is scanned by a trained licensed
medical technologist and analyzed using a FDA-approved, validated
semi-automated scanning imaging
workstation ( )and accompanying imaging analysis software
The resultant FISH section/slide is then presented to the interpreting Pathologist, who will
reviews the FISH results from and compares them to the results
manually observed under Fluorescence Microscope. Therefore the
ratio is enumerated
by computer-aided counting as well as manual counting.
Interpretation of Test
The ratio for probe set 1 is derived by dividing the total number of
LSI 1p36 signals by the total number of LSI 1q25 signals in at least 20
interphase nuclei with
nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic glial cells. Cells with no
signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. The ratio for
probe set 2 is derived by dividing the
total number of LSI 19q13 signals by the total number of LSI 19p13
signals in at least 2 sets of 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping
nuclei in the neoplastic glial cells at
two different areas of the sample. Cells with no signals or with
signals of only one color are disregarded. References ranges for our
laboratory for allelic loss versus no
allelic loss were established by evaluating both probe sets in a
series of 40 normal cases from 10 different organs. For both probe set 1
and 2 a ratio of less than 0.80 taken
from at least 2 sets of 20 interphase nuclei at 2 different areas with
nonoverlapping nuclei is consistent with allelic loss. FISH and H&&E
stained slides have been reviewed
by the interpreting pathologist.

The diffuse astrocytoma has an area with up to 4 mitoses in 10 high power fields .There is no definite
microvascular
proliferation and no tumor necrosis identified in the initial and deeper sections .The immunostain for the
mutant
IDH1-R132H protein is negative .A point mutation is detected inIDHI byDNA sequencing (see
attached
report).
Overall , this diffuse glioma is consistent with anaplastic astrocytoma, WHO grade 3.

Page 2 of 4
Informative loci are :D1 S548, D151592, D1 S552, DI 9S219, D19S606, and D19S1182
Results -Comments
Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block (A2). DNA extracted
from a
corresponding blood specimen was used as a normal reference control.
H and E slide was examined and tumor DNA was enriched by microdissection
TEST DESCRIPTION :Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA (baseline )/ Tumor DNA
pairs using 3
markers at both 1 p and 19q. The 3 markers on 1 p are D15548, D1 S1592, and D1 S552 (with D1 S468,
D1S1612, and
D1 S496 as backup markers )and the 3 markers on 19q are D19S219, D19S412, and PLA2G4C (with
D19S606 and D19S1182 as backup ).Allmarkers are microsatellites (2 or 4 nt repeats )except PLA2G4C which is a
minisatellite (26
nt repeat )polymorphism .The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score ,amplicon size, and
ease of
interpretation .The backup markers are used if the firstline markers at that chromosome arm are
uninformative or
otherwise ambiguous in their interpretation . LOH at all informative loci on each chromosomal arm
represents the
typical finding in oligodendrogliomas with 1 p and 19q deletion.
FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a stand-alone diagnostic
test. This test
was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the
as required
by CLIA' 88 regulations. It has not been cleared or approved for specific uses by the U. S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA). The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These
results are
provided for informational purposes only, and should be interpreted only in the context of established

IDHI Mutation Detection Assay
Date Ordered : Date Reported:
Interpretation
POSITIVE - There is evidence of IDH1 point mutation as indicated by the nucleotide change in codon 132
compared to the electropherogram of the reference normal sample (wild type).
The amino acid substitution is p.Argl32Ser
Results -Comments
TEST DESCRIPTION: IDH1/2 Mutation Analysis
Test performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block -Al
H and E slide was examined and no microdissection was needed.
Mutation of IDHI occurs early in glioma progression with somatic mutations of the R132 residue of IDHI
identified in
majority (>70%) of grades II and III astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas ,as well as in secondary GBMs
that
developed from these lower grade lesions .Mutation analysis of closely related IDH2 revealed mutations
of IDH2
residue R172 ,with most mutations occurring in tumors lacking IDHI mutations .Tumors with IDHI or
IDH2 mutations
have distinctive genetic and clinical characteristics ,and patients with such tumors have a better outcome
than those
with wild type IDH genes.

Mutations in IDHI/2 are detected by DNA sequencing procedures. The limit of detection of standard
bidirectional
sequencing is approximately 20-25%. In order to increase assay sensitivity tumor enrichment must be
performed by
manual microdissection when tumor cells in the block constitute less than 50% of nucleated cells.

COMMENT: This tumor consists primarily of large areas of diffuse 
low-grade glioma with primarily astrocytic features but also containing 
oligodendrogliomatous areas. There are a few areas of increased 
cellularity in which there are increased mitoses. The Ki-67 labeling 
index is 5-~0% in such areas while the remainder of the tumor shows less

COMMENT 
The specimen is portions of cerebrum that are slightly to heavily 
infiltrated 
by a glial neoplastic proliferation. The neoplastic nuclei tend to be 
round, 
. are distributed within a dense gliofibrillary background in the solid 
areas, 
and have proclivity for the white matter. FocallYI there is brisk 
mitotic 
activity (up to 20 mitoses fields), and the MIB-1 
proliferation index is 
On one slide from the 
is glial 
neoplasm with tumor necrosis, microvascular cellular proliferation, 
and 
necrotizing vasculopathy with thrombosis. 
The neoplasm is a glioblastoma multi forme (WHO grade IV).  In part A the tumor is very cellular. In part B the cerebrum is 
sparsely to 
moderately infiltrated by the neoplasm and the glioma is present 
within the 
leptomeninges. 
PROCEDURES/ADDENDA 
MGMT Promoter 
Date Ordered: 
Interpretation Date Reported: 
NEGATIVE: No evidence of methylated MGMT promoter is detected. 
Results-Comments 
Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block 
H slide was examined and no microdissection was 
needed. A'very low level 
ampiification was detected in the first run (1 of 2 PCRs) , but we were 
unable 
to reproduce this result in repeat peR reaction. The amplicon level 
appears to 
be below our assay detection level. The housekeeping control gene 
COL2A1 
showed adequate amplification. Therefore, we favor the low level 
positivity as 
background ... 
TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT 
promoter 
have been shown to benefit from therapy with alkylating agents. 
Assessment of 
MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite treatment of DNA 
followed 
by real-time PCR amplification (MethyLight) of methylated and 
unmethylated DNA 
sequences. Tne analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by 
serial 
dilution of methylated positive control DNA into unmethylated DNA, and 
was 
assessed to be 1% of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated 
DNA. 
Factors such as the presence of >50% non-neoplastic cells in the 
sample, or 
extensive tissue necrosis, may preclude the detection of methylated 
MGMT 
promoter sequences,

markers 
onlp are D18548, D181592, and D18552 (with D18468, D181612, and 
D18496 as 
backup markers) and the 3 markers on 19q are D198219, D198412, and 
PLA2G4C 
(with D198606 and D1981182 as backup). All markers are microsatellites 
(2 or 4 
nt repeats) except PLA2G4C which is a mini satellite (26 nt repeat) 
polymorphism .. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score, 
'amplicon size, and ease of interpretation. The backup markers are used 
if. the 
first line markers at that chromosome arm are uninformative or 
otherwise 
ambiguous in their interpretation. LOH at all informative loci on each 
chromosomal arm represents the typical finding in oligodendrogliomas 
with Ip 
and 19q deletion .

TEST DESCRIPTION: Testing performed on RNA extracted from tumor 
paraffin block 
H slide was reviewed and no microdissection was 
needed. 
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an attractive molecular 
target 
in glioblast~ma because it is amplified, overexpressed, and/or mutated 
in up 
to 40% to 50% of patients. Epidermal growth factor receptor variant 
III· 
(EGFRvIII) is an oncogenic, constitutively active mutant form of EGFR 
that is 
commonly expressed in glioblastoma. Cell culture and in vivo models of 
glioblastoma have demonstrated EGFRvIII as defining prognostically 
distinct 
subgroups of glioblastomas. Additionally, the presence of EGFRvIII has 
been 
shown to sensitize tumors to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors when the 
tumor 
suppressor protein PTEN is intact. RNA is extracted from formalin 
fixed, 
paraffin embedded tissue samples and reverse transcribed to cDNA. The 
cDNA is 
then amplified using standard PCR technique for DNA templates. PCR 
products 
are detected by gel electrophoresis. The limit of detection of this 
assay has 
been determined to be approximately 5 mutant cells in 100 normal 
cells.  FDA Comment:· The above data are not to be construed as the results

COMMENT 
In parts A and C there is a neoplastic proliferation of glial cells that has 
focal infiltrative areas with mitoses and microvascular cellular proliferation 
(part A). The bulk of the tumor is made of zones of very cellular groups of 
undifferentiated cells with brisk mitotic activity and high MIBI proliferation 
index; these u~differentiated cells are contained within zones of a very 
vascular sarcomatous component. There are no neuronal elements. 
In part A most of the tissue is necrotic, and only a couple of small fragments 
have the infiltrating glioblastoma. 
In part B there is only a cluster of undifferentiated neoplasm surrounded by 
spindle cell tissue. 
In part C there are extensive areas of necrosis and the sarcomatous component. 
The findings are interpreted as a glioblastoma with sarcomatous features, i.

nuclear pleomorphism. Mitotic figures are found with difficulty, and 
the 
MIB-1 proliferation index ix low at about 3% in the more active areas. 
There 
is not microvascular cellular proliferation or necrosis. 
The glioma is some\llhat cellular and has nuclear pleomorphism. 
However, there 
are not anaplastic features1 i.e. brisk mitotic activity, necrosis, or 
microvascular cellular proliferation. The atypical cellular features 
portend . 
a heightened biological potential, Nhich in addition to the focal 
enhancement 
on imaging studies suggest on going anaplastic transformation of the 
neoplasm. 
The features in the biopsy may be correlated with clinical, imaging/ 
and

NEGATIVE -No evidence of EGFRviii mutation is detected 
Results-Comments 
TEST DESCRIPTION: Testing performed on RNA extracted from tissue 
paraffin 
block 
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an attractive molecular 
target 
in glioblastoma because it is amplified, overexpressed, and/or mutated 
in up 
to 40% to 50% of patients. Epidermal growth factor receptor variant 
III 
{EGFRviii) is an oncogenic, constitutively active mutant form of EGFR 
that is 
commonly expressed in glioblastoma. Cell culture and in vivo models of 
glioblastoma""have demonstrated EGFRviii as defining prognostically 
distinct 
subgroups of glioblastomas. Additionally, the presence of EGFRviii has 
been 
shown to sensitize tumors to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors when the 
tumor 
suppressor protein PTEN is intact. RNA is extracted from formalin 
fixed1

CLINICAL HISTORY 
progressive 
months ago. On imaging there is a left frontal lobe-centered 
enhancing mass 
that extends into the corpus callosum. There are also several 
enhancing 
satellite lesions. MRS demonstrates increased levels of choline, 
decreased 
NAA, and no lipid or lactate spikes. 
OPERATIVE DIAGNOSES 
Left brain tumor 
Operation/Specimen: A: Brain tumor, biopsy 
PATHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS: 
A. Brain, site not specified, excisional biopsies: 
1. Glioblastoma 
2. MIB-l proliferation index: 20%. 
See Microscopy Description and Comment. 
COMMENT 
The sections contain portions of an astrocytic neoplastic 
proliferation that 
has nuclear anaplasia, mitotic activity, and sparse microvascular 
cellular 
proliferation with necrosis and rnicrothrombosis. There are frequent 
giant 
cells, several of them multinucleated and bizarre. Some of the giant 
cells 
and smaller cells are immunoreactive with neuronal markers. The MIB-l 
proliferation index is high at about 20% in the more active areas. 
The findings are interpreted as those of a glioblastoma (WHO IV) with 
probably 
a neuronal component, which may portend a less grave prognosis.  PROCEDURES/ADDENDA

Date Reported: 
NEGATIVE -No evidence of EGFRvIII mutation is detected 
Results-Comments 
TEST DESCRIPTION: Testing performed on RNA extracted from paraffin 
block 
H slide was examined and no microdissection was 
needed. 
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an attractive molecular 
target 
in glioblastoma because it is amplified, overexpressed t and/or mutated 
in up 
to 40% to 50% of patients. Epidermal growth factor receptor variant 
III 
(EGFRvIII) is an oncogenic, constitutively active mutant form of EGFR 
that is 
commonly expressed in glioblastoma. Cell culture and in vivo models of 
glioblastoma have demonstrated EGFRvIII as defining prognostically 
distinct 
subgroups of glioblastomas. Additionally, the presence of EGFRvIII has 
been 
shown to sensitize tumors to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors when the 
tumor 
suppressor protein PTEN is intact. RNA is extracted from formalin 
fixed, 
paraffin embedded tissue samples and reverse transcribed to eDNA. The 
cDNA is 
then amplified using standard PCR technique for DNA templates. PCR 
products 
are detected by gel electrophoresis. The limit of detection of this 
assay has 
been determined to be approximately 5 mutant cells in 100 normal 
cells. 
FDA Comment: The above data are not to be construed as the results 
from a

determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These 
results are 
provided for informational purposes only, and should be interpreted 
only in 
the context of established procedures and/or diagnostic criteria. 
Interpretation 
NEGATIVE: No evidence of methylated MGMT promoter is detected. 
Results-Comments 
Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block 
H slide was examined and no microdissection was 
needed. 
TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT 
promoter 
have been shown to benefit from therapy with alkylating agents. 
Assessment of 
MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite treatment of DNA 
followed 
by real-time PCR amplification (MethyLight) of methylated and 
unmethylated DNA 
sequences. The analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by 
serial 
dilution of methylated positive control DNA into unmethylated DNA, and 
was 
assessed to be 1% of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated 
DNA. 
Factors such as the presence of >50% non-neoplastic cells in the 
sample, or 
extensive tissue necrosis, may preclude the detection of methylated 
MGMT 
promoter sequences.

Immunohistochemical stains for MIB-1 was performed on a paraffin-embedded sections of the brain lesion. The 
Mffi-llabeling index is low, supporting the above diagnosis. 
Results ofFISH for lp19q will be reported in an addendum. 
ADDENDA: 
lp and 19q FISH studies were performed on cells within paraffin sections from tumor. Two hybridizations were 
performed: one with a 19q probe/contro119p pair and one with alp probe/controllq pair. The 19q and lp probes 
mapped to the regions that are commonly deleted in gliomas. The 19q to 19p probe ratio was 0.60. The lp to lq 
probe ratio was 0.57. For both probes, the normal ratio is approximately 1. Any ratio less than 0.80 is consistent 
with deletion of the chromosomal region of interest. 
The results are abnormal and consistent with deletion of lp and 19q. Similar results have been observed in glioma 
specimens, especially oligodendrogliomas.

MICROSCOPIC: A. Portions of brain extensively infiltrated by a
cellular neoplastic proliferation of glial cells with nuclear
anaplasia, mitotic figures, focal necrosis and microvascular cellular
proliferation. There also are vessels with thick hyalinized walls. In
the smears, but also in the tissue, many cells have an oligodendroglial
phenotype.

FEATURES AND ELEVATED PROLIFERATION INDEX, SEE MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION, 
SEE NOTE 
2. Right parietal: GLIAL NEOPLASM WITH OLIGODENDROCYTIC FEATURES AND

Comment: 
While many of areas of this tumor demonstrate features of an 
oligodendroglioma, there is no area demonstrating the classic tightly 
packed, honeycomb-like architecture of an oligodendroglioma with 
numerous perinuclear halos. In addition, perinuclear halos are 
relatively rare in this tumor. This may be due to the fact that all of 
the tissue was frozen and therefore the classic morphology may have 
been disrupted. As a result, a definitive diagnosis of 
oligodendroglioma cannot be made reliably. If this tumor were an 
astrocytoma, the presence of mitoses would require a diagnosis of an 
anaplastic astrocytoma, grade Ill (WHO scale). However, if this were 
an oligodendroglioma, the presence of mitoses would lead to a diagnosis 
of oligodendroglioma, grade II (WHO scale). In any case, the 
proliferation index is relatively high for a grade II 
oligodendroglioma. In fact, oligodendrogliomas with proliferation 
indices of greater than 5% are associated with a significantly poorer 
prognosis than those with proliferation indices less than 5% (1 ). 
Therefore, regardless of lineage, this tumor is likely to behave more 
aggressively than a typical grade II oligodendroglioma. Genetic 
analysis for the 1 p, 1 9q deletion seen in many prognostically favorable 
oligodendroglia! tumors is pending and when completed, a separate 
report will be issued.

This diagnostic report has been personally interpreted by the signatory

Microscopic Description: 
The tumor consists of an infiltrative and moderately pleomorphic 
proliferation of glial cells with relatively round nuclei. In some 
areas, there are perinuclear halos. There is a fine capillary network 
that in some areas displays a chicken-wire pattern. Scattered mitoses 
are present, however, there is no endothelial proliferation or 
necrosis. Immunohistochemistry for the proliferation antigen Ki67 was 
performed as follows: Nine 250 x 250 micron fields were counted and the 
percentage of labeled nuclei determined. More than 1 ,000 cells were 
"":ounted. The proliferation index ranged from 1 0.5% to 18.4% with an 
overall average of 13.6%.

CLINICAL HISTORY:
Brain tumor left frontal anaplastic astrocytoma.
GROSS EXAMINATION:
A. ""Brain tumor (AF1-2)"", received fresh. A 6.5 x 5.0 x 3.0 cm resection of
brain tissue is received. Representative tissue is frozen as AF1-2, the
frozen section remnants are submitted in respective blocks Al-2. Additional
representative sections are submitted as A3-8.
INTRA OPERATIVE CONSULTATION:
A. ""Brain tumor"":AFl- gliosis, atypical cells
AF2- glioblastoma
MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:
Permanent sections reveal a highly cellular pleomorphic population of
astrocytes consistent with a high grade glioma. The area interpreted as
necrosis on frozen section as AF2 actually represents an area of hemorrhage as
seen in permanent sections.
DIAGNOSIS:
A. ""BRAIN TUMOR"":
ANAPLASTIC ASTROCYTOMA (WHO GRADE III). SEE COMMENT.
COMMENT: Hemorrage due to surgical trauma, present in permanent section on
block A2 was interpreted as frank necrosis at frozen section. No frank
necrosis is appreciable in any of the permanent sections, making this an
anaplastic astrocytoma.
I certify that I personally conducted the diagnostic evaluation of the above
specimen(s) and have rendered the above diagnosis(es).

Brain, left frontal No.1,2,3, biopsy: Grade 3 (of 4) oligoastrocytoma, astrocytic predominant (WHO, grade III). 
·Immunohistochemical stains were performed on paraffin embedded tissue using antibodies to GFAP, p53 and 
Mill-1. GFAP is positive in neoplastic cells with astrocytic morphology. p53 protein is overexpressed in the 
majority of tumor cells. MIB-llabeling index is moderate. The findings support the above diagnosis. 
ADDENDA: 
1 p and 19q FISH studies were performed on cells within paraffin sections from tumor. Two hybridizations were 
performed: one with a 19q probe/control 19p pair and one with a 1p probe/control1q pair. The 19q and 1p probes 
mapped to the regions that are commonly deleted in gliomas. The 19q to 19p probe ratio was 1.00. The 1p to lq 
probe ratio was 1.02. For both probes, the normal ratio is approximately 1. Any ratio less than 0.80 is consistent 
with deletion of the chromosomal region of interest. 
There was no evidence of deletion of lp or 19q. However, 60.1% of the cells had 3-4 copies of the lp, 1q, 19p and 
19q probes. Similar results have been observed in other glioma specimens with gain of chromosomes 1 and 19. 
The results may also be consistent with tumor tetraploidy or aneuploidy.

PCR for EGFR variant III mutation 
Date Ordered: 1IIIIIIII Date Reported: 
Interpretation 
NEGATIVE -No evidence of EGFRvIII mutation is detected 
Results-Comments 
TEST DESCRIPTION: 
Testing performed on RNA extracted from paraffin block 
H slide was examined and no microdissection was 
needed. 
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an attractive molecular 
target 
in glioblastoma because it is amplified, overexpressed, and/or mutated 
in up 
to 40% to 50% of patients. Epidermal growth factor receptor variant 
III 
(EGFRvIII) is an oncogenic, constitutively active mutant form of EGFR 
that is 
commonly expressed in glioblastoma. Cell culture and in vivo models of 
glioblastoma have demonstrated EGFRvIII as defining p'rognostically 
distinct 
subgroups of glioblastomas. Additionally, the presence of EGFRvIII has 
been

Addendum Discussion:
The neoplastic cells are diffusely immunoreactive for GFAP. In addition, the GFAP and
neurofilament immunohistochemistry stain demonstrates in addition to relatively solid
areas, the tumor does diffusely infiltrate the gray and white matter. The neoplastic cells
are immunoreactive for P53. In most areas, the tumor is infiltrative with NeuN positivity
among the tumor cells is not specific. In the most solid area of the tumor, there is a
suggestion of weak NeuN positivity within the tumor cells but this positivity is much
weaker than the surrounding neurons. The reticulin stain does not demonstrate
investment of individual cells. Overall, the findings are suggestive of a diffusely
infiltrative glioma. In the solid areas of tumor, scattered MIB-1 reactive cells are present
with an estimated labeling index of 3-5%, consistent with a low grade process.
Addendum Diagnosis:
Diffuse well-differentiated Astrocytoma (WHO grade II).
Microscopic Description:
Sections demonstrate fragments of gray and white brain matter. A focus of markedly
increased cellularity is identified. Cells within this areaappear to be glial in origin. They
are mainly small with round to ovoid nuclei .Few of the cells are larger and demonstrate
prominent nucleoli .Mitotic figures are not seen. Few neurons surrounding the focus
demonstrate enlarged nuclei with prominent nucleoli .4B also demonstrates a nodular
focus of large fibrillary astrocytes with somewhat glassy fibrillary cytoplasm. Also,
scattered more atypical cells are seen. A rare binucleate cell is noted. Possible
eosinophilic granular bodies are seen."," 1. ""Site"": Brain - mentioned as brain tissue is being examined in the microscopic description.

MGMT PROMOTER METHYLATION REAL TIME PCR ANALYSIS

of Dr. on paraffin block
complete report from is on file in the
Result:
MGMT PROMOTER METHYLATION NOT IDENTIFIED.
Note:eTh
The specimen is considered negative for MGMT promoter methylation when
Methylation Index (MI) is less than 4. MI between 4 and 16 is considered as
low level methylation and should be interpreted with caution since the
significance of low level methylation in gliomas is not well understood. MI
greater than 16 is considered as methylated.
Background:
MGMT (0 (6) -methyl guanine -DNA methyltransferase) is a DNA repair enzyme
that is involved in the repair of damage caused by a variety of DNA
crosslinking compounds, including alkylating agents. Increased
methylation of the MGMT gene promoter region causes diminished or
silenced expression of the gene, making cells more sensitive to DNA
damage. This relationship has been shown for glioblastomas and
alkylating agents such as Temodar(R)(temozolomide).
Approximately 40% to 45% of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tumors
exhibit MGMT gene methylation. Retrospective studies have shown that
detection of MGMT promoter methylation in tumor samples is associated
with an increased likelihood of a favorable response to temozolomide.
Methodology:
DNA is isolated from formalin-'fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
specimen. Molecular analysis of the MGMT gene is performed by
methylation-specific PCR. Molecular-based testing is highly accurate but
as in any laboratory test, rare diagnostic errors may occur.
Results of this test are for Investigational Purposes Only. The
performance characteristic of this assay have been determined by
The result should, not. be used.. as a.di.agnos.tic procedure

MICROSCOPIC: 
A and B. Both specimens reveal an aplastic proliferation of 
oligodendrocytes with different degrees of cellularity and cytological 
 atypia. In some areas, the tumor is well differentiated and the 
neoplastic cells display well defined cell borders and typical peri­
nuclear halos. In these areas, the cellularity is low and there is no 
significant mitotic activity. However, most of the tumor consists of 
areas of higher cellularity, with more pronounced nuclear pleomorphism 
and readily identified mitotic figures. The stromal vessels in these 
areas display endothelial hyperplasia. Except for one area present in 
the frozen section control slide, there are no extensive foci of 
necrosis. The tumor infiltrates the cortex in many areas and reveals 
neoplastic satellitosis around non-neoplastic cortical neurons. There 
is also evidence of previous hemorrhage within the tumor and numerous 
interstitial calcifications are also present. In some areas, the 
tumor 
completely replaces the entire gyri and produces subpial aggregates on 
adjacent gyri. 
In summary, the findings are those of an anaplastic oligodendroglioma. 
The grade in the tumor is anaplastic as based on the high degree of 
cellularity, nuclear pleomorphism and mitotic activity in several

Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block 
TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT promoter 
have been shown to benefit from therapy with alkylating agents. Assessment 
of 
MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite treatment of DNA 
followed 
by real-time peR amplification (MethyLight) of methylated and unmethylated 
DNA 
sequences. The analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by serial 
dilution of methylated positive control DNA into unmethylated DNA, and was 
assessed to be 1% of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated DNA. 
Factors such as the presence of >50% non-neoplastic cells in the sample, or 
extensive tissue necrosis, may preclude the detection of methylated MGMT  promoter sequences.

A: Brain, right frontal tumor, biopsy
Pathologic Diagnosis
Brain ,right frontal ,excisional biopsy :Anaplastic oligodendroglioma (WHO 3).
1p, 19q LOH ( codeletion ):Positive.
MGMT :Positive.
MIB-1 proliferation index: 18%.
See Microscopy Description and Comment.
Comment
The sections contain portions of a rather cellular glial neoplastic proliferation that has an oligodendroglial
phenotype.
The neoplastic cells are rather uniformly round, with a borderline mitotic rate of 3% / ten high power fields,
and an
elevated MIB-1 proliferation index of 18% in the more active areas. The tumor has focal microvascular
proliferation,
but is devoid of tumor necrosis. There are also zones of sparse cellularity with microcalcifications.
The neoplasm is a cellular oligodendroglioma with 1 p, 19q LOH codeletion, positive IDH 1, a modest
mitotic rate,
positive MGMT, and a high proliferation index. The biopsy is somewhat small, contains tumor at the low
end of
anaplastic transformation, and is probably not representative of the anaplastic regions depicted on the
imaging
studies
The morphological features in this sample may be correlated with clinical, imaging, and operative findings
for their
interpretation and patient's follow up.

Loss of Heterozygosity 1 p, 19q Assay (LOH)
Date Ordered : Date Reported:
Interpretation
POSITIVE: Allelic loss on chromosome arm 1 p and chromosome arm 19q is detected.
Informative loci are: D1S548, D1S1592, D1S552, D19S412
Results -Comments
Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block (Al). DNA extracted from
a
corresponding blood specimen was used as a normal reference control. D19S219, PLA2G4C, D19S606
and
D19S1182 loci are not informative. Histologic correlation is necessary.
H and E slide was examined and no microdissection was needed.
TEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA ( baseline )/ Tumor DNA
pairs using 3
markers at both 1 p and 19q. The 3 markers on 1 p are D1 S548, D1 S1592, and D1 S552 (with D1 S468,
D1S1612, and
D1S496 as backup markers) and the 3 markers on 19q are D19S219, D19S412, and PLA2G4C (with
D19S606 and
D19S1182 as backup). All markers are microsatellites (2 or 4 nt repeats) except PLA2G4C which is a
minisatellite (26

nt repeat) polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score, amplicon size, and
ease of
interpretation. The backup markers are used if the first line markers at that chromosome arm are
uninformative or otherwise ambiguous in their interpretation. LOH at all informative loci on each chromosomal arm
represents the
typical finding in oligodendrogliomas with 1 p and 19q deletion.
FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a stand-alone diagnostic
test. This test

focally, hemorrhagic, tannish-gray glistening. In total 1-5. 
INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION: Brain, left occipital: High histological 
grade glioma (C/W glioblastoma multiforme) . 
MICROSCOPIC: Portions of brain extensively infiltrated and focally 
effaced by a neoplastic proliferation of glial cells with prominent 
nuclear pleomorphism and anaplasia. Frequently, cells are 
multinucleated. There are mitotic figures, and microvascular cellular 
proliferation is focally prominent. There is no necrosis. 
COMMENT: The lesion is a high histological grade glioma with prominent 
nuclear anaplasia, mitotic figures, and microvascular cellular 
proliferation. These are features that in the WHO classification 
correspond to a grade IV/IV glioma. Focally, there is suggestion of an 
oligodendroglial component.

 Diagnosis Consistent with well differentiated astrocytoma  
"," 1. ""Site"": Brain - The report mentioned a biopsy of the brain and described the specific cell types found in the brain tissue. Justification: The report clearly states that the biopsy was taken from the brain and describes the specific cell types found in the brain tissue.

2. ""Laterality"": Not provided - The report does not specify whether the lesion is located in the left or right hemisphere of the brain. Justification: The report does not provide any information about the laterality of the lesion.

3. ""Histology"": Infiltrating glioma - The report describes the biopsy as demonstrating mildly hypercellular gray and white matter, with atypical cells and reactive astrocytes, consistent with an infiltrating glioma. Justification: The report states that the biopsy is convincing for infiltrating glioma.

4. ""Stage"": Not provided - The TNM system is typically used for staging solid tumors, but it is not applicable to brain tumors. Instead, brain tumors are typically classified by their grade and type. Justification: The report does not provide any information about the stage of the tumor, as this classification system is not typically used for brain tumors.

5. ""Grade"": Grade II (Low grade or well-differentiated) - The report describes the tumor cells as having round to oval nuclei with only a few atypical features and no mitotic figures, which are indicative of a low-grade tumor. Additionally, the MIB-1 labeling index is 1.7%, further supporting a low-grade tumor. Justification: The report describes the tumor as well differentiated and indicates that it has low-grade histologic features and a low proliferation rate.

6. ""Behavior"": Malignant - While the tumor is classified as low grade, it is still a malignant neoplasm due to its ability to invade surrounding tissues. Justification: The report describes the tumor as a neoplasm, which by definition is a new and abnormal growth of tissue, and indicates that it is infiltrating the surrounding brain tissue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 Microscopic  Discussion:  
 1,2  Sections demonstrate a moderately hypercellular glial neoplasm.  The tumor is composed predominantly of ordinary gemitocytes and fibrillary astrocytes.  A minor population of smaller gemistocytes is s een but definite oligodendroglioma 
differentiation is not noted.  Atypia is moderate to marked but no mitotic figures 
are identified.  There is no microvascular proliferation or necrosis.  
 Addendum Di scussion : 
 The neoplastic cells are immunoreactive for p53, suggesting astrocytic origin.  
MIB-1 reactive cells are present throughout the tumor.  A labeling index of 6.2% 
is calculated.  This is at the high end of the range expected in a grade II astrocytoma but would be relatively low for a higher grade tumor .  Overall, this 
does not warrant classification of the tumor as anaplastic, but does indicate the need for close observation

FLUORESCENCE IN SITU HYBRIDIZATION (FISH) for EGFR In BRAIN 
Tissue Block: 11 
RESULTS: POSITIVE for EGFR Amplification (See note below) 
Number of cells evaluated: 40 
INTERPRETATION: 
Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis on a brain tumor sample from this patient with Abbott 
Molecular probes specific for the centromere of chromosome 7 (control probe) and the short arm (EGFR-
7p12) of chromosome 7 was performed. 
These studies showed amplification of the EGFR gene with a 11.8 ratio of EGFR signals to the 
centromere signals in 80% of the nuclei examined. 
NOTE: 
1. Samples are considered positive in brain if the EGFR to CEP 7 signal ratio is "" 2.0 in "" 10% of 
analyzed cells or tumors with four or more copies of the EGFR gene in "" 40% of the cells (high 
polysomy). 
2. Samples are considered inconclusive, requiring consult with the pathologist, in brain if the EGFR to 
CEP 7 signal ratio is"" 2.0 in <10% of analyzed cells or when four or more copies of the EGFR gene in <

Total # signals/total # nuclei counted for 19p probe = 97
19q/1 9p = 0.62
Background :The most prevalent genetic anomaly in both grade II and grade III oligodendrogliomas is co-deletion of
chromosome arms 1 p and 19q 1. It was recently shown that the co-deletion of 1 p and 19q is mediated by an
unbalanced translocation t(1;19)(gl 0;p10) 2. Loss of 1 p and 19q has been used as a diagnostic as well as prognostic
marker of oligodendroglial tumors. Recent literature 2,3 suggests that oligodendrogliomas with loss of 1 p and 19q are
likely more responsive to chemotherapeutic drugs/ radiation therapy, and such tumors may represent a ""favorable""
form of oligodendrogliomas.
Method :The 1 p36/ 1 q25 and 19q / 19p13 were applied to the provided paraff in-embedded tissue
sections. This probe set contains 1 p36 and 1 q25 in one vial. The other
set/vial contains 19q13 and 19pl3 The probe sets were applied
individually to treated tissue sections and then sections were viewed and interphase nuclei were examined for
corresponding signals.

TP53 MUTATIONS NOT DETECTED. SEE OBJECTIVE FINDINGS AND COMMENT.
Comment: Mutations in TP53 are rarely found in gliomas with lp/19q loss of
heterozygosity. TP53 mutations are more often found in astrocytic tumors and
correlate with a worse prognosis. Additional information can be found in
McLendon et al. Cancer. 2005; 104:1693-9 and references within. Clinicians
should correlate these results with clinical and other laboratory findings.
The sensitivity of DNA sequencing is 99% for the detection of nucleotide base
changes, small deletions, and insertions in the regions analyzed. However,
this assay may not detect an acquired mutation which is present below the 25%
detection limit (i.e., mutant cell population of < 25%). Only the coding
regions of the TP53 gene and immediate flanking intronic sequences were
examined. Changes in the promoter region, farther into the introns, or in
other non-coding regions of the gene would not be detected. Mutations in genes
other than TP53 would not be identified. Large deletions, duplications,
multiple exon insertions, sequence alterations adversely affecting primer
binding, and complete deletion of one allele may not be identified using these
methods. For additional information or for help interpreting the results of
this test, please contact the

COMMENT 
Permanent sections confirm the frozen section diagnosis. Sections show a 
densely cellular glial neoplasm with extensive areas of necrosis. Marked 
acute 
inflammatory response is noted within the necrotic areas, Perivascular 
lymphocytic infiltrates are also present, as are other reactive changes. The 
tumor cells show moderate nuclear pleomorphism with occasional bizarre 
nuclei. Several mitotic figures are noted. There is endothelial cell hypertrophy, 
often associated vlith fibrin thrombi. 
Grocott methylamine silver stain is negative for fungus. Gram stain is 
negative for bacterial microorganisms. Immunostains for GFAP, S100 and CD56 
are strongly positive ,.ithin the neoplastic cells. KPl (CD68) is positive 
only in occasional histiocytes. The tumor cells are negative for pancytokeratin 
and 
cytokeratin AE1/AE3. 
The tumor cell nuclei are diffusely p53 positive. The Ki-67 labelling index 
is  approximately 25%. Posi ti ve and negative controls shmv appropriate 
reactivity.

icroscopic  
 
Sections demonstrate a variably cellular glioma that diffusely infiltrates both the gray and white matter.  In the gray matter, perineural satellitosis, perivascular satellitosis and subpial condensation are all seen.  The tumor cells consistently have round nuclei with mild to moderate atypia.  Most have perinuclear halos.  Neither microvascular proliferation nor tumor necrosis are seen.  As noted, cellularity is variable, ranging from modest to nearly confluent.  In these more cellular areas, scattered mitoses are seen with iup to 4 mitoses per 10 high power fields, although most areas show fewer.  
 Addendum  
 Scattered MIB -1 reactive cells are present throughout the tumor.  In the most 
proliferative region, a labeling index of 4.4% is calculated.  This is evidence against anaplastic progression.  Nevertheless, the mildly elevated mitotic count warrants close follow up.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
Sections of A and B show an infiltrating glial neoplasm composed of. cells
with
mostly eccentrically placed round nuclei reminiscent of mini-gemistocytes.
Other areas show similar cells with angulated nuclei and more astrocytic
appearing morphology similar to conventional gemistocytes. Rare mitotic
figures are noted and occasional apoptotic cells are seen.Necrosis and/or
definite vascular proliferation are not identified. The tumor is strongly,
diffusely p53 immunoreactive. The Ki-67 labeling index is approximately 5%
overall and 15% in the most proliferative areas.

2-5,· representative. 
Brain tumor. 
Formalin. Four irregular, tan-white, soft tissue fragments, 3-5 rom in 
dimension. 
MICROSCOPIC: A. Portions of cerebral cortex with moderately increased 
cellularity due to the presence of small round and elongated 
hyperchromatic nuclei. Around vessels there are accumUlations of these 
nuclei cuffing the vessels. In these zones the neoplastic cells have a 
definite astrocytic phenotype. There are no mitoses, microvascular 
Page 1  cellular proliferation or necrosis. 
B. Portions of cerebral cortex and adjacent white matter·~ and 
leptomeninges. The white matter contains a neoplastic proliferation of 
glial cells similar to the ones described for part A. The neoplastic 
nuclei are round or elongated, have moderate pleomorphism, and 
infiltrate the cerebral cortex. Around vessels, the neoplastic cells 
form nests of prominently fibrillary astrocytes. In the cerebral 
cortex at the pial-glial interface they accumulate focally. A couple 
of nests of neoplastic cells are observed in the leptomeningeal space. 
There are no mitoses, microvascular cellular proliferation, or areas of 
necrosis. The neoplasm is present in the deeper margin of the white 
matter throughout the specimen. 
C. Portions of cerebral cortex and adjacent white matter. The tissue 
is infiltrated by a glial neoplasm similar to that one described for 
parts A and B. In this specimen, however, there is a focal area of 
solid neoplasm, which is more cellular and contains proliferative 
mdcrovessels. A couple of these microvessels have microvascular 
cellular proliferation, and one microvessel has undergone necrosis and 
thrombosis, and the immediately surrounding tumor tissue is undergoing 
necrosis with pseudopalading. One mitotic figure is identified. 
SPECIAL STAINS: Immunoperoxidase stains for GFAP and MIBI are 
performed on blocks 2 and 6. 
The IIIIIdemonstrates the strong fibrillary component of the tumor 
cells around vessels (#2), and in solid tumor (#6). With the MIB-l 
proliferation indices of 1.5% and 9% are determined in specimen Band 
C, respectively. 
COMMENT: In parts A and B (right temporal lobe) there is a diffusely 
infiltrating glioma involving white and gray matter. The neoplasm has 
moderate. nuclear atypia, is devoid of mitotic figures, microvascular 
cellular proliferation, and/or necrosis, and particularly in 
perivascular areas has a well defined astrocytic phenotype. This 
neoplasm has a MIB-l proliferation index of 1.5%. A couple 
of small fragments of similar neoplasm is observed in the 
leptomeningeal space. These are features of a histologically low grade 
(WHO grade II/IV) astrocytoma. In specimen C there is a similar 
neoplasm. However, in here there is a zone of solid tumor in which 
cellularity ;.s prominent, a couple of microvessels have microvasculnr 
uellular proiiferation, one microvessel has undergone necrosis and lS 
surrounded by a microscopic zone of tumor necrosis, and one mitotic 
figure is observed. The MIB-1 proliferation index in this specimen is 
9%. These morphological findings are those of a high 
histological grade glioma, possibly a glioblastoma multiforme. The 
specimen is small, and may not be representative of the entire lesion. 
The morphological findings may be correlated with clinical, imaging, 
and intraoperative findings for final determination.

gl:::1omic DNA was pu-~if Led from the sample. The DNA yield was determined, and the 
seJmples were brou:Jht to an optimal concentration. Real-time peR was used to evaluate 
specific mutationc>, deletions and insertions in the tyrosine kinase domai n of the 
EI: idermal Growth Pactor (EGFR) gene. Eight reactions containg 30 primer and probe  sets were used to target specific regions of exons 18-21 as well as the 
sequence. 
Intended Use: The EGFR mutation analysis by real-time peR is able to detect the wild 
type sequence and 29 known mutations, deletions and insertions found in exons 18-21 
of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain. The results of this study are to be interpreted

Interpretation
POSITIVE: Allelic loss on chromosome arm 1 p and chromosome arm 1 9q is detected.
Informative loci are :D1S1592, D15552, D195412, PLA2G4C
Results -Comments
Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block
a
corresponding blood specimen was used as a normal reference control.(A2). DNA extracted from
H and E slide was examined and tumor DNA was enriched by microdissection
TEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA (baseline)! Tumor DNA
pairs using 3 markers at both 1 p and 19q. The 3 markers on 1 p are D1 S548, DI S1592, and D1 S552 (with D1 S468,
D1 S1612, and
D1 S496 as backup markers) and the 3 markers on 19q are D19S219, D19S412, and PLA2G4C (with
D1 9S606 and
D19S1182 as backup). All markers are microsatellites (2 or 4 nt repeats) except PLA2G4C which is a
minisatellite (26
nt repeat) polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score, amplicon size, and
ease of
interpretation. The backup markers are used if the first line markers at that chromosome arm are
uninformative or
otherwise ambiguous in their interpretation. LOH at all informative loci on each chromosomal arm
represents the
typical finding in oligodendrogliomas with 1 p and 19q deletion.

Date Ordered : Date Reported:
Interpretation
POSITIVE: Methylated MGMT promoter is detected.
Results -Comments
Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block (A2)
H and E slide was examined and tumor DNA was enriched by microdissection
TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT promoter have been shown to
benefit
from therapy with alkylating agents .Assessment of MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfate
treatment of
DNA followed by real-time PCR amplification of methylated and unmethylated DNA
sequences. The
analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by serial dilution of methylated positive control DNA into
unmethylated DNA, and was assessed to be 11% of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated
DNA. Factors
such as the presence of >50% non-neoplastic cells in the sample, or extensive tissue necrosis, may
preclude the
detection of methylated MGMT promoter sequences.

OPERATIVE DIAGNOSES 
Operation/Specimen: A: Temporal tumor, excision biopsy 
tumor, 
COMMENT 
Sections show a poorly preserved gemistocytic astrocytoma 
demonstrating 
moderately high pleomorphism. A few scattered mitotic figures and 
apoptotic -06-6389 
bodies are noted. Microvascular proliferation and necrosis are not 
seen. A 
minor oligodendroglial component may also be present. 
The tumor is diffusely and strongly p53 positive. The Ki-67 labeling 
index is 
approximately 20% Positive and negative controls show appropriate 
immunoreactivity.

Loss of Heter~, 19q Assay (LOH) 
Date Ordered:1IIIIIIIIII Date Reported: 
Interpretation 
NEGATIVE: Allelic loss on chromosome arm lp and chromosome arm 19q is 
NOT detected. 
Informative loci are: D181592, D18552, D198219, D198412, and PLA2G4C 
Results-Comments 
Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block 
DNA extracted from a corresponding blood specimen was used as normal 
reference 
control.  H slide was examined and no microdissection was 
needed. 
TE8T DE8CRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA 
(baseline)/ TUmor DNA pairs using 3 markers at both Ip and 19q. The 3 
markers 
on Ip are D18548, D181592, and D18552 (with D18468, D181612, and 
D18496 as 
backup markers) and the 3 markers on 19q are D198219, D198412, and 
PLA2G4C 
(with D19S606 and D19S1182 as backup). All markers are microsatellites 
(2 or 4 
nt repeats) except PLA2G4C which is a minisatellite (26 nt repeat) 
polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score, 
amplicon size, and ease of interpretation. The backup markers are used 
if the 
first line markers at that chromosome arm are uninformative or 
otherwise 
ambiguous in their interpretation. LOR at all informative loci on each 
chromosomal arm represents the typical finding in oligodendrogliomas 
with 1p 
and 19q deletion.

Interpretation 
POSITIVE: Methylated MGMT promoter is detected. 
Results-Comments 
Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block 
H slide was examined and no microdissection was 
needed. 
TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT 
promoter 
have been shown to benefit from therapy with alkylating agents. 
Assessment of  MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite treatment of DNA 
followed 
by real-time PCR amplification (MethyLight) of methylated and 
unmethylated DNA 
sequences. The analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by 
serial 
dilution of methylated positive control DNA into unmethylated DNA, and 
was 
assessed to be 1% of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated 
DNA. 
Factors such as the presence of >50% non-neoplastic cells in the 
sample, or 
extensive tissue necrosis, may preclude the detection of methylated 
MGMT 
promoter sequences.

PATHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS: 
A. Right frontal tumor, resection: High-grade mixed glioma (see 
comment) . 
B. Corpus callosum, resection: Cerebral cortex, no evidence of 
tumor. 
COMMENT 
Sections show a classic appearing oligodendroglial neoplasm centered 
in the 
deep white matter. Mitotic figures are readily identified. The deeper, 
possibly intraventricular portions of the tumor show a papillary 
structure 
with astroblastoma type cells forming perivascular rosettes, best seen 
by GFAP 
immunostain. There are also areas of astrogliosis, vascular 
proliferation and 
hyalinized necrosis however these show features suggesting that they 
are 
reactive to prior treatment, e.g., radiation. 
The tumor is diffusely weak to moderately p53 positive and the Ki-67 
labeling 
index is focally up to approximately 30%. 
Given the presence of the astroblastoma-like component, and that the 
previous 
resection from this patient was interpreted as an astrocytoma, the 
tumor may 
perhaps best be considered a high-grade mixed glioma. Considering the 
findings C'~-<-'

Anaplastic 
oligoastrocytoma (WHO Grade III) (see comment). 
C.· Brain, right posterior parahippocampal gyrus, excision biopsy:

COMMENT 
Permanent sections confirm the diagnosis of glioma. Sections show a 
moderately · 
pleomorphic astrocytoma with gemistocytic features. Some areas show 
more round 
shaped tumor .. cell nuclei. Occasional apoptotic cells and rare mitotic 
ffgUres 
are rioted. Definite vascular proliferation or necrosis are not seen. 
Immunohistochemical stains show that the tumor is diffusely and 
strongly p53 
positive. The Ki-67 labeling index is approximately 7%. Positive and 
negative 
controls show appropriate immunoreactivity. 
Sections of C. show temporal lobe with hippocampal dentate gyrus and 
no 
definite tumOr. 
Although the tumor appears to show mixed oligodendroglial and 
astrocytic 
morphology, the predominant component appears to be astrocytic.

Test performed on DNA extracted from tissue paraffin block 
TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT 
promoter 
have been shown to benefit from therapy with alkylating agents. 
Assessment of 
MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite treatment of DNA 
followed 
by real-time PCR amplification (MethyLight) of methylated and 
unmethylated DNA 
sequences. The analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by 
serial 
dilution of methylated positive control DNA into unmethylated DNA, and 
was 
assessed to be 1% of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated 
DNA. 
Factors such as the presence of >50% non-neoplastic cells in the 
sample, or 
extensive tissue necrosis, may preclude the detection of methylated 
MGMT 
promoter sequences.

"," Based on the given pathology report, the six categories with available information are:

1. Site: The biopsies were taken from various locations in the brain, including right temporal tip, superior uncus, right posterior parahippocampal gyrus, superior temporal tumor, and superior medial temporal lobe.
2. Laterality: All biopsies were from the right side of the brain.
3. Histology: The specimens are described as tan-gray fragments or friable tissue, but specific histological diagnoses are not provided for each part.
4. Stage: The stage is not provided since this information is typically determined based on clinical and radiographic findings rather than pathologic examination of a biopsy.
5. Grade: A high-grade glioma is suggested in the frozen section report, but specific grades are not assigned to other parts.
6. Behavior: The behavior of the lesions cannot be definitively determined from this report.

Justification: These six categories were chosen because they represent the most relevant and commonly reported information in a pathology report, providing essential details about the specimen, diagnosis, and clinical context.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

FIXATIVE: Formalin. 
GENERAL: Multiple small and large soft, fleshy, tan-white tissue 
fragments size ranging from 0.5-2.4 om. Cut surface is 
non-homogeneous with areas of hemorrhage. 
SECTIONS: Xl-X5. 
  
 MICROSCOPIC: A. Portion of cerebral cortex and adjacent white matter 
with slightly increased cellularity. There is an occasional atypical 
nucleus. There are areas of rarefaction with prominent reactive 
astrocytes. 
B,C. Portions of brain tissue extensively infiltrated by a neoplastic 
proliferation of glial cells with an astrocyte phenotype. The tumor 
is 
moderately cellular, with moderate nuclear atypia. Mitotic figures 
are 
not identified. Some microvessels are prominent, however, no clear 
microvascular cellular proliferation is present. 
D. Large portions of cerebral cortex and white matter partially or 
totally effaced by a glial neoplastic proliferation with features 
similar to those ones described for parts B and C. In here, however, 
there are focal areas with greater cellularity (""proliferation 
centers11), in which mitotic activity is readily identified. Focally, 
nee-formed vessels are present, but are devoid of bone fide 
microvascular cellular proliferation. There are no areas of necrosis. 
SPECIAL STAINS: immunoperoxidase methods for GFAP and MIB-1 were 
performed on sections from block XS. The GFAP demonstrates the heavy 
fibrillary component of the neoplasm, with the MIB-1 a proliferation 
index of 23% is determined in a proliferation center. 
COMMENT: In this brain there is an astrocytoma that infiltrates and 
effaces the brain. The tumor has prominent gliogenesis. The 
neoplastic cells have moderate nuclear atypia, and mitotic activity is 
confined to some more cellular areas. The proliferation index in 
these 
areas is 23%. Although nee-vessels are focally prominent, there is no 
definitive microvascular cellular proliferation. 
These morphological features are those of an astrocytoma with focal 
anaplastic transformation. "," 1. ""Site"": Brain. The report clearly indicates that all specimens are from the brain.
2. ""Laterality"": Not provided. The report does not specify the laterality of the tumor.

5. ""Grade"": II-III (Intermediate to High grade). The report mentions atypical features and moderate nuclear atypia, but no clear signs of high-grade malignancy like necrosis or microvascular cellular proliferation are present.
6. ""Behavior"": Malignant. The tumor is infiltrating the brain and has potential for further growth and invasion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PCR for EGFR 
Date Ordered: mutation 
Date Reported: 
 Interpretation 
NEGATIVE -No evidence of EGFRvIII mutation is detected 
Results-Comments 
TEST DESCRIPTION: Testing performed on RNA extracted from tissue 
paraffin 
block 
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an attractive molecular 
target 
in glioblastoma because it is amplified, overexpressed, and/or mutated 
in up 
to 40% to 50% of patients. Epidermal growth factor receptor variant 
III 
(EGFRvIII) is an oncogenic, constitutively active mutant form of EGFR 
that is 
commonly expressed in glioblastoma. Cell culture and in vivo models of 
glioblastoma have demonstrated EGFRvIII as defining prognostically 
distinct 
subgroups of glioblastomas. Additionally, the presence of EGFRvIII has 
been 
shown to sensitize tumors to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors when the 
tumor 
suppressor protein PTEN is intact. RNA is extracted from formalin 
fixed, 
paraffin embedded tissue samples and reverse transcribed to eDNA. The 
cDNA is 
then amplified using standard PCR technique for DNA templates. PCR 
products 
are detected by gel electrophoresis. The limit of detection of this 
assay has 
been determined to be approximately 5 mutant cells in 100 normal 
cells. 
FDA Comment: The above data are not to be construed as the results 
from a 
stand alone diagnostic test. This test was developed and its

has 
determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These 
results are 
provided for informational purposes only, and should be interpreted 
only in 
the context of established procedures and/or diagnostic criteria. 
Interpretation  POSITIVE: Methylated MGMT promoter is detected. 
Results-Comments 
Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block 
H slide was examined and no microdissection was 
needed. 
TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT 
promoter 
have been shown to benefit from therapy with alkylating agents. 
Assessment of 
MGMT promoter. methylation status involves bisulfite treatment of DNA 
followed 
by real-time PCR amplification (MethyLight) of methylated and 
unmethylated DNA 
sequences. The analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by 
serial 
dilution of methylated positive control DNA into unmethylated DNA, and 
was 
assessed to be 1% of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated 
DNA. 
Factors such as the presence of >50% non-neoplastic cells in the 
sample, or 
extensive tissue necrosis, may preclude the detection of methylated 
MGMT 
promoter sequences.

SUPPLEMENTARY AND FINAL REPORT
SPECIMEN :A.Right frontal tumour.
B. Right frontal tumour.
C. Tumour .
Further tissue sections of the glioma have been. examined, additional
immunohistochemica.l studies performed, and FISH results finalized.
Examination: of the additional sections of the gJ.ioma, which is now been examined
in its entirety, reveals similar microscopic appearances to those initially
report. Variable cytoarchitectural patterns are evident, ranging from sparsely
cellular microcystic, through to microscopic nodular areas where the neoplastic
cells aggregate closely, and have a variably pleomorphic and hyperchromatic
nuclei, minimal cytoplasm, and demonstrates some nuclear angulation and
.irregularity. No areas of vascular endothelial proliferation or pali.sading
necrosis have been identified. Maximal mitotic counts within the h.ypercellular
areas, seven. mitotic figures per 10 high power fields (field area 0.196 mm
squared) T:he. proliferation index, as judged by .irmunohistochemicai staining for
the proliferation marker MIS I is variable. Low-grade and sometimes mierocystic
areas typically have low MTS .1 indices, with relatively rare nuclear labelling,
but the small hypercellular foci. demonstrate elevated labelling.
Immunohistdchemical staining for p5.3 protein demonstrates no convincing nuclear
positivity. Synaptophysin staining is evident in many of the neopl..astic cells,
particularly in hypercellular foci, and takes the form of granular Cytoplasmic
positivity, sometimes with perinuclea.r dot like exenteration. There is no
convincing positivity for°NeuN., which highlights scattered mononuclear neuronal
cells, which do not demonstrate abnormal clustering or cytologic ,features such
as bi.nucleation.. Neurofilament highlights this non-neoplastic population,
together with an entrapped network of processes of background neuropil.
Representative formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections were submitted
for FISH (fluorescence in situ. hybridization] studies to assess ip, 19q and
r""GFR.The F'T1414 .+- t.rt: ern ,-- -- . W
The
results of the studies (which have been reported separately) demonstrated no
loss of ip and no loss of 19q, and EGFR amplification was not detected.
'In summary, considering these results and additional findings, this diffuse
cghicma. is perhaps best regarded as a diffuse WHO Grade I11 mixed oligc -
astrocyLama,
;NCLUSION: Right. frontal tumor. W110 Grade 1.11 mixed oligo- astr ocytoma., lacking
ip and 19q deletions, and. demonstrating no evidence FGFR amplification.
Comment: Grading of oli.goast.rocytonias is a problematic area in surgical
neuropathology.. There is no specific grading scheme for ohigoastrocytoma in the
most recent WHO Classification of Tumors of the CNS. In grading
oligcastrocytoma, many authorities now adopt the same grading scheme as used for
of igodendrogl iorma. The minimum criteria for a diagnosis of WHO Grade III
anaplastic gli.oma in this setting are not well defined. Many authorities regard
mitotic activity (greater than 5 mitotic figures per 10 high power fields) as a valuable parameter of anaplasia in the absence of endothelial proliferation,
palisading necrosis, or frankly an.aplastic cytology and hypercellularity.. In
this case, overt features of anaplasia are not evident, but the maximal mitotic
count exceeds 5 mitotic figures per 10 high power fields, and in hypercellular
foci the MIB I determined proliferation index is relatively high.. As such, the
findings areamount to a WHO grade III oligoast.rocytoxna.

CLINICAL HISTORY
-year-old man had left atypical oligoastrocytoma operated on
followed by XRT and Temodar. Current MRI demonstrates possible recurrent
tumor.
OPERATIVE DIAGNOSES
Recurrent brain tumor.
Operation/Specimen: A: Brain,recurrent tumor, excision biopsy
PATHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS:
Brain, site not specified, excision:
1.Mixed oligoastrocytoma, anaplastic.
2.MIB-1 proliferation index: \R\ 50%.
See Comment.
COMMENT
The specimen is portions of cerebrum extensively and heavily infiltrated by a
glial neoplastic proliferation that has a mixed oligoastrocytic phenotype,
predominantly astrocytic. The neoplastic cells have nuclear anaplastic
features, and there is brisk mitotic activity. There is no appreciable
microvascular cellular proliferation or necrosis.
The neoplasm has morphology similar to the original resection; in the current
resection, however, there is distinct cellular anaplasia, with a very high
proliferation index of about 50%.
LOH testing of the neoplasm is being performed, and result will be reported
in
an addendum.

Loss of Heterozygosity 1p, 19q Assay (LOH)
Date Ordered: Date Reported:
Interpretation
POSITIVE: Allelic loss on chromosome arm 19q is detected.
There is no evidence of allelic loss on chromosome 1p. Informative loci are: D1S548, D1S552, D19S219, D19S1182
Results-Comments
Test performed on paraffin block -A3 and peripheral blood for
germline comparison.
TEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA
(baseline)/ Tumor DNA pairs using 3 markers at both 1p and 19q. The 3 markers
on 1p are D1S548, D1S1592, and D1S552 (with D1S468, D1S1612, and D1S496 as
backup markers) and the 3 markers on 19q are D19S219, D19S412, and PLA2G4C
(with D19S606 and D19S1182 as backup). All markers are microsatellites (2 or
4
nt repeats) except PLA2G4C which is a minisatellite (26 nt repeat)
polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score,
amplicon size,and ease of interpretation. The backup markers are used if the
first line markers at that chromosome arm are uninformative or otherwise
ambiguous in their interpretation. LOH at all informative loci on each
chromosomal arm represents the typical finding in oligodendrogliomas with lp
and 19q deletion.
FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a
stand-alone diagnostic test. This test was developed and its performance
characteristics determined by the . as
required by CLIA ' 88 regulations. It has not been cleared or approved for
specific uses by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA has
determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These results
are
provided for informational purposes only, and should be interpreted only in
the context of established procedures and/or diagnostic criteria.
TECHNICAL SENSITIVITY :The presence of >15% non-neoplastic cells in the
sample
may preclude the detection of allelic loss.

FIXATIVE: Formalin.
GENERAL: Received are three irregular, pink-tan to gray-white fragments f
brain tissue, ranging from .5 cm. in greatest dimension to 2.0 x 1.2 x 1.0
cm.
Two smaller fragments of brain tissue are bisected.
SECTIONS: All submitted; Al - one fragment bisected, A2 - second fragment
bisected, A3-A5 - largest fragment sectioned.
MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY: The GFAP demonstrates tumor cells in a gliofibrillary
background; many cells, however, appear as naked nuclei. A great majority of
cells over express the p53 protein. With the MIB1 there is a proliferation
index of about 50% in the denser white matter zones. The NeuN demonstrates
the diffusely infiltrating character of the neoplasm.

Test performed on 
TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT promoter 
have been shovm to benefit from therapy with alkylating agents. Assessment of 
MGMT promoter methylation ·status involves bisulfite treatment of DNA followed 
by real-time PCR amplification (MethyLight) of methylated and unmethylated DNA 
sequences. The analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by serial 
dilution of methylated positive control DNA into unrnethylated DNA, and viaS 
assessed to be 1% of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated DNA. 
Factors such as the presence of >50% non-neoplastic cells in the sample, or 
extensive tissue necrosis, may preclude the detection of methylated MGMT 
promoter sequences.

The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an attractive molecular target 
in glioblastoma because it is amplified, overexpressed t and/or mutated in up 
to 40% to 50% of patients. Epidermal growth factor receptor variant III 
(EGFRvIII) is an oncogenic, constitutively active mutant form of EGFR that is 
commonly expressed in glioblastoma. Cell culture and in vivo models of 
glioblastoma have demonstrated EGFRvIII as defining prognostically distinct 
subgroups of glioblastomas. Additionally, the presence of EGFRvIII has been 
shown to sensitize tumors to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors when the tumor 
suppressor protein PTEN is intact. RNA is extracted from formalin fixedt 
paraffin embedded tissue samples and reverse transcribed to cDNA. The cDNA is 
then amplified using standard peR technique for DNA templates. PCR products

----------------------------------------------------------------
Operation/Specimen: Recurrent brain tumor; subfrontal dropped
metastasis.
Clinical History and Pre-Op Dx: year old woman with past history of
2 surgeries for oligodendroglioma. Currently, large recurrence,
multicystic.
GROSS PATHOLOGY:
A. Received fresh, one fragment, 0.5 cm across. Soft, tannish-gray.
In total #1.
INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION: Brain, smears: Glioma (C/W
oligodendroglioma, high histological grade).
B.
SPECIMEN: 3, subfrontal dropped metastasis.
FIXATIVE: Saline.
GENERAL: A 1.1 x 0.7 x 0.3 cm. soft red-tan tissue fragment.
SECTIONS: 2, all submitted.
C.
SPECIMEN: 2, permanent recurrent brain tumor.
FIXATIVE: Saline.
GENERAL: A 2.5 x 2.4 x 1.0 cm., 2.5 gm. aggregate of soft, red to
gray-tan brain tissue.
SECTIONS: 3-5 - all submitted.
MICROSCOPIC: A. Small fragments of brain infiltrated and focally
effaced by a glial neoplastic proliferation. The neoplastic cells have
round nuclei with occasional perinuclear halos. There is prominent
karyorrhexis, mitotic figures are found without difficulty, and there
is microvascular cellular proliferation.
B. Portions of a solid glial neoplasm. The neoplastic cells have
large round nuclei with moderate pleomorphism. The background is
finely fibrillary with microvesicular change. The vascularity is
capillary-type with focal ""chicken-wire"" pattern. There is prominent
endothelial and microvascular cellular proliferation, focally. There
are mitotic figures throughout the neoplasm. There is no necrosis.
C. Portions of brain extensively effaced by a glial neoplastic proliferation similar to that one described for parts A and B.
In here, the neoplasm seems to be growing in the leptomeningeal space.
The focally surrounding white matter is rarefied and gliotic.
IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY: Immunoperoxidase methods for GFAP, MIB-1, and
factor VIII antigen were performed on sections from block #4.
The GFAP demonstrates numerous gliofibrillary oligodendrocytes and
minigemistocytes. With the MIB-1 a proliferation index of 50% is
determined in the more active areas. The factor VIII depicts a high
density of microvessels and prominent microvascular cellular
proliferation.
COMMENT: The neoplasm present in the three specimens is an
oligodendroglioma with prominent cellularity, mitotic activity, and
microvascular cellular proliferation, features of an anaplastic
oligodendroglioma. The MIB-l proliferation index is 50%. The neoplasm
seems to be growing in the leptomeninges.

Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block 
TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT 
promoter 
have been shQI·Jn to benefit from therapy with alkylating agents. 
Asse,~sment of 
MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite treatment of DNA 
followed 
by real-time'PCR amplification (MethyLight) of methylated and 
unmethylated DNA 
sequences. The analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by 
serial 
dilution of methylated positive control DNA into unmethylated DNA, and 
was 
assessed to be l~ of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated 
DNA. 
Factors such as. the presence of >50~ non-neoplastic cells in the 
sample, or 
extensive tissue necrosis, may preclude the detection of methylated 
MGMT 
promoter sequences.

 Pathology Report  
 
 Microscopic Description:  
Microscopic examination reveals an infiltrating glioma. Many of the tumor cells demonstrate elongated to oval nuclei with moderate nuclear pleomorphism. Intermixed amongst these cells and seen separately i n small clusters, are neoplastic cells with 
predominantly round nuclei and an apparent paucity of fibrillary processes. Overall, cytologic atypia appears moderate with scattered cells showing more significant atypia. The tumor cells are embedded in a variably fibrillary and myxoid background. In areas, the cells are arranged in distinct cellular nests with foci of prominent clustering around blood vessels. Neither necrosis nor microvascular proliferation are seen. Up to four mitotic figures per 10 high powe r fields are counted.  
 Addendum Discussion:  
The tumor cells are negative for expression of synaptophysin. They demonstrate strong positivity for GFAP. The calculated MIB-1 Labeling Index is 10.7%. Overall, the histologic features in conjunction with the M IB-1 Labeling index are consistent with a 
high grade glioma.

COMMENT 
Part A is portions of cerebrum, and fragments of necrotic tissue. There is 
not viable tumor in this specimen. 
Parts Band C are portions of cerebrum that are heavily infiltrated and 
extensively effaced by a glial small cell neoplastic proliferation. The 
neoplastic cells have nuclear anaplasia, brisk mitotic activity, and a very 
high proliferation index of about 50% throughout the tumor. There is focal 
microvascular cellular proliferation, and there are zones of tumor necrosis,

MGMT Promoter Methylation 
Date Ordered: 
Interpretation Date Reported: 
NEGATIVE: No evidence of methylated MGMT promoter is detected. 
Results-Comments 
Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block 
TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT promoter 
have been shown to benefit from therapy with alkylating agents. Assessment 
of 
MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite treatment of DNA 
followed by real-time PCR amplification (MethyLight) of methylated and unmethylated 
DNA sequences. The analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by serial 
dilution of methylated positive control DNA into unmethylated DNA, and was 
assessed to be 1% of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated DNA. 
Factors such as the presence of >50% non-neoplastic cells in the sample, or 
extensive tissue necrosis, may preclude the detection of methylated MGMT 
promoter sequences. 
FDA COMMENT: The above data are not be construed as the results from a 
stand alone diagnostic test. This and its performance 
characteristics de~ined by the laboratory as 
required by CLIA 'l1li regulations. or approved for 
specific uses by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA has 
determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These results 
are provided for informational purposes only, and should be interpreted only in 
the context of established procedures and/or diagnostic criteria. 
Interpretation  NEGATIVE -No evidence of EGFRvIII mutation is detected 
Results-Comments 
TEST DESCRIPTION: Testing performed on RNA extracted from tumor paraffin 
block 
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an attractive molecular 
target 
in glioblastoma because it is amplified, overexpressed, and/or mutated in up 
to 40% to 50% of patients. Epidermal growth factor receptor variant III 
(EGFRvIII) is an oncogenic, constitutively active mutant form of EGFR that 
is 
commonly expressed in glioblastoma. Cell culture and in vivo models of 
glioblastoma have demonstrated EGFRvIII as defining prognostically distinct 
subgroups of glioblastomas. Additionally, the presence of EGFRvIII has been 
shown to sensitize tumors to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors when the tumor 
suppressor protein PTEN is intact. RNA is extracted from formalin fixed, 
paraffin embedded tissue samples and reverse transcribed to eDNA. The cDNA 
is 
then amplified using standard PCR technique for DNA templates. PCR products 
are detected by gel electrophoresis. The limit of detection of this assay 
has 
been determined to be approximately 5 mutant cells in 100 normal cells. 
FDA Comment: The above data are not to be construed as the results from

COMMENT
The clinical history of recently excised low grade astrocytoma (WHO Grade II)
is noted. Indeed, surgical residua of this procedure are noted in specimen #7.
Multiple biopsies from the frontal lobe, and tumor immediately adjacent to the
surgical cavity (specimen #7) shows astrocytoma with marked cytologic atypia,
hypercellularity and scattered mitotic figures. The degree of atypia attains
that of high grade astrocytoma, WHO Grade III. The diagnostic features of
a glioblastoma multiforme, i.e. necrosis, endothelial proliferation, are not
identified. Diffusely involving the majority of the resected tissue in
specimens #7,#8 and #9 is astrocytoma with grade II features :moderate
hypercellularity, inconspicuous mitotic figures, and mild to moderate nuclear
atypia. overall, we estimate that approximately 20% of the tumor resected shows
grade III features and approximately 80% shows grade II features. This is of
course a somewhat arbitrary estimate, as the differentiating criteria
(hypercellularity, atypia) exist on a spectrum and are not clearly delineated.

GENERAL: Multiple tan-brown fragments 8 x 5 x 3 em. in 
aggregate. ~- representative. 
MICROSCOPIC: A-C. Nine blocks, nine slides. Sections show a 
diffusely infiltrating glial tumor composed of cells with round nuclei 
and a ""fried egg"" appearance. There is focal hypercellularity and 
microcystic change. Several microgernistocytes are present within the 
lesion. No mitotic activity or vascular endothelial proliferation is 
noted. The features are of an oligodendroglioma, grade B. MIB-1 is 
about 8-10%. 
"," 1. ""Site"": Brain, specifically the Temporal Lobe. Justified by the report's mention of the temporal lobe lesion and biopsy.
2. ""Laterality"": Not provided, as the report does not specify whether the left or right temporal lobe is affected.
3. ""Histology"": Oligodendroglioma. The report describes the tumor cells as having a ""fried egg"" appearance, which is characteristic of oligodendrogliomas.
4. ""Stage"": Not applicable, as staging is not typically used for brain tumors. Instead, brain tumors are often described by their grade.
5. ""Grade"": Grade II (Low grade or well-differentiated). The report describes the tumor as having no mitotic activity or vascular endothelial proliferation, which are features of a low-grade tumor.
6. ""Behavior"": Malignant, as all tumors are by definition abnormal growths and can be considered malignant in that sense. However, the specific behavior of this tumor is not described in the report.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 Pathology Report for Subject: 
 Addendum Discussion: The neoplastic cells exhibit cytoplasmic immunoreactivity for GFAP. The background brain parenchyma demonstrates immunopositi vity for 
synaptophysin. CAM 5.2 is essentially negative. The MIB -1 labe ling index ranges up to 
6.5% in the most proliferative regions of tumor. Overall, the histologic features are consistent with an anaplastic oligodendroglioma.   
 
Addendum Diagnosis:  
1-3. Anaplastic Oligodendroglioma.  
- MIB-1 labeling index = 6.5%.  
 
Micros copic Description:  
1. Permanent section of the frozen section specimen demonstrates hypercellular brain with numerous scattered macrophages, many of which contain hemosiderin. There are admixed reactive small cells as well as clusters of cells that may represent neoplasm.  
 2,3. Sections demonstrate sheets and irregular large nodules of neoplastic cells associated with extensive necrosis. In some areas a myxoid stroma is seen. Blood vessels are thick walled and hypercellular and, in specimen 2, hyalinized. Atypia is moderate and mitotic figures are surprisingly rare. In the unfrozen material the tumor cells tend to have small to intermediate sized round nuclei with a small nucleolus. The cytoplasm is 
clear. Although much of the tumor is a nodular pattern, sl ide 3A shows apparent diffuse 
infiltration.  
"," 1. ""Site"": Brain - The report specifically mentions ""brain parenchyma"" in the description.
2. ""Laterality"": Not provided - The report does not mention any laterality information.
3. ""Histology"": Anaplastic Oligodendroglioma - This is the diagnosis provided in the report.
4. ""Stage"": Not provided - The report does not contain any information related to staging.
5. ""Grade"": High grade or poorly differentiated (Grade III) - The term ""anaplastic"" suggests a high-grade tumor, which is also reflected in the MIB-1 labeling index of 6.5%.
6. ""Behavior"": Malignant - This is inherent to the diagnosis of a cancerous tumor like anaplastic oligodendroglioma.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

tumor moderately cellular and shows only scant mitotic activity. An old biopsy site with marked 
reactive changes is identified. 
ADDENDA: 
I p and 19q FISH studies were performed on cells within paraffin sections from tumor. Two hybridizations were 
performed: one with a 19q probe/control19p pair and one with alp probe/controllq pair. The 19q and lp probes 
mapped to the regions that are commonly deleted in gliomas. The 19q to 19p probe ratio was 0.55. The lp to lq 
probe ratio was 0.56. For both probes, the normal ratio is approximately 1. Any ratio less than 0.80 is consistent 
with deletion of the chromosomal region of interest. 
The results are abnormal and consistent with deletion of lp and 19q. Approximately 46% of cells were apparently 
tetraploid but still had relative loss of 1 p and 19q probe signals. Similar results have been observed in glioma 
specimens, especially oligodendrogliomas.

Clinical History and Pre-Op Dx: None given. 
GROSS DESCRIPTION: 
A. ""Left temporal lobe"", discoid portion of cerebral cortex and white 
matter, 4.5 x 4 x 1.5 em, semifirm. Submitted in total, 1-13. 
B. ""Left temporal uncus"", four fragments, aggregating to 1 x 1 x 0.3 
em. Semifirrn, tanish-white. In total, 14. 
C. ""Left parahippocampus"", one fragment, 1 x 0.7 x 0.3 em. Tanish­
white. In total, 15. 
D. ""Left hippocampus"", five fragments, aggregating to 3 x 2.2 x 0.9 
em. Semifirm, tanish-white. In total, 16-19. 
MICROSCOPIC: A. Portions of cerebral cortex and adjacent white 
matter 
which are focally extensively infiltrated by a neoplastic 
proliferation 
of glial cells. The neoplastic cells have rather small nuclei with 
moderate nuclear pleomorphism, and diffusely permeate the white matter 
and cortex with prominent perineuronal satellitosis and focal subpial 
accumulation. Mitotic figures are occasionally seen, however, 
microvascular cellular proliferation or necrosis is absent. 
B. Fragments of brain tissue extensively infiltrated by a neoplasm 
similar to that described for part A. The cellularity is higher and 
the nuclear pleomorphism is more prominent in this specimen, and 
mitotic figures are also observed. Again, microvascular cellular 
proliferation and necrosis are absent. 
C. Portions of brain tissue extensively infiltrated by a neoplasm 
similar to that described for part A. 
D. Portions of hippocampus which are focally infiltrated by a 
neoplasia similar to that described for part B, which is effacing the 
dentate gyrus and pyramidal cell layer. 
SPECIAL STAINS: MIB-1 and factor VIII AA immunoperoxidase methods 
were 
preformed on blocks 5 and 14. 
With the MIB-l, a labelling index of about 15% was determined on 
section 14 in areas of solid tumor. With the FVIII AA, no endothelial  microvascular proliferation was demonstrated. 
COMMENT: In all the four specimens, there is extensive infiltration 
of 
the gray and white matter by a fibrillary astrocytoma. The tumor 
effaces the normal cortical architecture with the presence of 
prominent 
satellitosis and focal subpial accumulation. 
throughout the specimens are considered to be 
neurons, The neurons present 
native entrapped 
not part of the neoplasm. The tumor is moderately cellular with 
moderate nuclear pleomorphism, and is not difficult to find mitotic 
figures. However, microvascular cellular proliferation and necrosis 
are absent. The cellularity, degree of nuclear atypia and presence of 
mitoses with a high MIB-1 labelling index of 15%, justify a diagnosis 
of anaplastic astrocytoma. The absence of endothelial proliferation, 
however, probably places this neoplasm at the low end of the spectrum 
of anaplastic astrocytomas.

Result:
MGMT PROMOTER METHYLATION NOT DETECTED.
Methylation of the MGMT (O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase) gene was
not detected using methylation specific PCR technologies.
Background:
MGMT (0(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase) is a DNA repair enzyme
that is involved in the repair of damage caused by a variety of DNA
crosslinking compounds, including alkylating agents. Increased
methylation of the MGMT gene promoter region causes diminished or
silenced expression of the gene, making cells more sensitive to DNA
damage. This relationship has been shown for glioblastomas and
alkylating agents such as Temodar(R)(temozolomide).
Approximately 40% to 45% of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tumors
exhibit MGMT gene methylation. Retrospective studies have shown that
detection of MGMT promoter methylation in tumor samples is associated
with an increased likelihood of a favorable response to temozolomide.
Methodology:
DNA is isolated from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
specimen. Molecular analysis of the MGMT gene is performed by
methylation-specific PCR and detected on Molecular-based
testing is highly accurate but as in any laboratory test, rare
diagnostic errors may occur.
Results of this test are for Investigational Purposes Only. The
performance characteristic of this assay have been determined by
The result should not be used as a diagnostic procedure
without confirmation of the diagnosis by another medically
established diagnostic product or procedure.

Results-Comments 
TEST DESCRIPTION: Testing performed on RNA extracted from paraffin 
tissue block 
H slide was examined and tumor DNA was enriched by 
microdissection. 
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an attractive molecular 
target 
in glioblastoma because it is amplified, overexpressed, and/or mutated 
in up 
to 40% to 50% of patients. Epidermal growth factor receptor variant 
III 
(EGFRvIII) is an oncogenic, constitutively active mutant form of EGFR 
that is 
commonly expressed in glioblastoma. Cell culture and in vivo models of 
glioblastoma have demonstrated EGFRvlIl as defining prognostically 
distinct 
subgroups of glioblastomas. Additionally, the presence of EGFRvllI has 
been 
shown to sensitize tumors to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors when the 
tumor 
suppressor protein PTEN is intact. RNA is extracted from formalin 
fixed, 
paraffin embedded tissue samples and reverse transcribed to eDNA. The 
cDNA is 
then amplified using standard PCR technique for DNA templates. PCR 
products 
are detected by gel electrophoresis. The limit of detection of this 
assay has 
been determined to be approximately 5 mutant cells in 100 normal 
cells.

NEGATIVE: No evidence of methylated MGMT promoter is detected. 
Results-Comments 
Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block (A2)  H slide was examined and tumor DNA was enriched by 
microdissection. 
TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT 
promoter 
have been shown to benefit from therapy with alkylating agents. 
Assessment of 
MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite treatment of DNA 
followed 
by real-time PCR amplification (MethyLight) of methylated and 
unmethylated DNA 
sequences. The analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by 
serial 
dilution of methylated positive control DNA into unmethylated DNA, and 
was 
assessed to be 1% of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated 
DNA. 
Factors such as the presence of >50% non-neoplastic cells in the 
sample{ or 
extensive tissue necrosis, may preclude the detection of methylated 
MGMT 
promoter sequences.

 Microscopic Description:  
1-3. Sections demonstrate an oligodendroglioma characterized by a proliferation of 
neoplastic cells which resemble oligodendrocytes. The tumor cells exhibit prominent perin uclear halos, rounded hyperchromatic nuclei and few cellular processes. Overall, 
the tumor cells exhibit moderate to marked cytologic atypia. They are arranged in sheets and infiltrate gray and white matter. Microvascular proliferation is identified as well as areas of early necrosis. An isolated focus of discrete necrosis is present which 
may represent previous biopsy site. Numerous mitotic figures are present at up to eight mitoses per 10 high power fields. Microgemicytes are readily identified admixed throughout the tumor.  Both microcalcifications and branching thin walled vessels, features characteristic of oligodendrogliomas, are readily identified. These histologic features are consistent with an anaplastic oligodendroglioma.  
"," 1. ""Site"": Brain. Justification: The report clearly states ""Left frontal brain tumor"" in the addendum diagnosis section.
2. ""Laterality"": Left. Justification: As mentioned above, the report specifies ""Left frontal brain tumor"".

specimen consists of a 0.9 cm. across and several smaller pieces
measuring up to 0.3 cm. in the aggregate, of grayish-white gelatinous
tissue.Specimen submitted in its entirety in cassette 2.
MICROSCOPIC:The sections from specimens 1 and 2 contain portions of a
neoplastic proliferation of glial cells with marked features of
anaplasia:severe nuclear pleomorphism, frequent mitotic figures,
vascular/endothelial proliferation, and focal areas of necrosis. The
tumor is diffusely infiltrating the cerebral cortex.
Immunoperoxidase stains for GFAP and MIB-1 are performed. The GFAP
demonstrates the astroglial nature of the neoplasm. With the MIB-1 a
30-40% labeling index is determined.
COMMENT:The lesion is a glioblastoma multiforme with a high MIB-1
labeling index.

Results of FISH studies for for lp and 19q deletion will be reported as an addendum.  TCGA-DB-5281 
ADDENDA: 
lp and 19q FISH studies were performed on cells within paraffin sections from tnmor. Two hybridizations were 
performed: one with a 19qprobe/controll9p pair and one with alp probe/controllq pair. The 19q and lp probes 
mapped to the regions that are commonly deleted in gliomas. The 19q to 19p probe ratio was 1.02. The lp to lq 
probe ratio was 0.87. For both probes, the normal ratio is approximately 1. Any ratio less than 0.80 is consistent 
with deletion of the chromosomal region of interest. 
there was no evidence of deletion of lp or 19q. However, approximately 70% of the cells had 3-4 copies of the lp, 
lq, 19p, and 19q probes. Similar results have been observed in other glioma specimens with gain of chromosomes 
I and 19. The results may also be consistent with tnmor tetraploidy or aneuploidy. 
This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, 
. It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and is to

 ADDENDUM DISCUSSION :     
Most of the neoplastic cells are reactive for GFAP, however, some of the          
 larger cells with halos are GFAP negative. Neu -N demonstrates that the tumor      
 cells are negative for Neu -N with only cortical neurons being pos itive. The       
 atypical cells, including the large cells without obvious processes are           
 strongly reactive for p53, suggesting astrocytic lineage.  There is variable      
 immunoreactivity for MIB -1. Slide 1A has a labeling index of <0.5% while  2A

2. Sections demonstrate a neoplastic proliferation of glial cells that              
diffusely infiltrate the gray and white matter. Hypercellular is quite modest.      
However, atypia ranges  from mild to marked. There is variably prominent             
autolytic change that results in artifactual perinuclear halos surrounding          
neurons in the gray matter. However, in addition, many of the atypical cells        
as well as smaller cells h ave halos that appear to be real and likely               
represent oligodendroglioma differentiation. In other areas, the tumor appears      
astrocytic. No mitotic figures are seen despite the atypia. There is no             
microvascular proliferation or necrosis.

Microscopy:
Histological sections stained with H & E show fragments of neocortex with
neuroepithelial neoplasm of white matter with marked cortical infiltration. The neoplastic
cells have round nuclei, delicate chromatin and inconspicuous nucleoli. The cytoplasm
is scant, indistinct, with frequent formation of perinuclear halos. The tumor infiltrates the
cortex, where it is observed neuronal satellitosis by neoplastic cells and the formation of
Scherer secondary structures in the subpial region. In some areas the tumor exhibits
greater cellularity, where there are some microcysts. Mitotic figures are occasional. It
was not observed vessels with microvascular proliferation in this material.

COMMENT: Sections show an infiltrating glioma with prominent: nuclear and
cellular p..ieomo.rphism and non-uniformity and a microcystic background.
Many tumor cells display gemistocytic morphology.Focally, the tumor
appears to extend into the subarachno.id space (slides ""A5"" and ""AV).
Mitoses are easily identified on routine H&E sections and im:runostudy for
the mitoses specific antibody ?HH3 reveals a maximum of 7 mitoses per 10
high power fields. I<i-67 (M.IB--l) shows an elevated proliferation index
of up to 10-15% approximately. Tumor cells and tumor cell processes are.
strongly immunoreact_ive for GFAP.The tumor is positive for mutated
isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1).P53 is immunoreactive in the majority
of tumor cells (more than 50%). There is focal individual tumor cell
necrosis; however, definitive areas of geographic or pseudopa.l.isading
necrosis are not seen in the sections examined. Definitive microvascular
proliferation is not identified in this material..These findings support
the diagnosis of anaplastic astrocyto:na (WHO Grade III)

Addendum Discussion:  
The  MIB -1 labeling index is calculated at up to 5.1% in the most 
proliferative regions. Although the MIB -1 labeling index is relatively high for 
a low grade oligodendroglioma, the lack of histolog ical anaplastic features, 
including necrosis, microvascular proliferation, hypercellularity and mitotic figures, are more consistent with a low grade oligodendroglioma. 
Nonetheless, the elevated MIB -1 labeling index is worrisome and close 
follow -up for recurrence and/or anaplastic progression is warranted.  
 
Addendum Diagnosis:  
Oligoastrocytoma, WHO grade II  
 Microscopic Description:  
Sections demonstrate a mildly hypercellular glial neoplasm composed predominantly of neoplastic cells with perinuclear halos and some 
perineuronal satellitosis. Occasional scattered large atypical hyperchromatic cells are noted. There is some edema, but no necrosis or 
microvascular proliferation is seen. No mitotic figures are identified.

SPECIMEN SUBMITTED: Paraffin block A3
INTERPRETATION
1 p intact: A majority of nuclei showed similar numbers of 1p36 and 1q25 signals.
There is no evidence of allelic loss on the short arm of chromosome 1 (1 p).
19q intact: A majority of nuclei showed similar numbers of 19q13 and 19p13 signals.
There is no evidence of allelic loss of 19q.
Allelic loss at one locus does not necessarily predict the presence of alterations at
other loci on the same chromosome , i.e. FISH may not detect partial allelic loss. FISH
may not detect allelic losses if there is loss of one allele and replication on the other
allele.
Comment: Allelic loss on chromosome 1 p has been shown to correlate with
chemoresponsiveness and long progression-free survival in some giiomas. This
correlation is stronger when there is concomitant allelic loss on 19q. An association of
chemoresponsiveness and/or long progression -free survival with allelic loss on 19q in
the absence of loss on 1 p has not been established, In patients with 1 p/1 9q loss,
aneusomy for chromosome 1and 19 may be associated with earlier recurrence.

roscopic Description:  
This tumor is an infiltrative glial neoplasm composed of pleomorphic  
astrocytes.  The malignant features of this tumor are best seen in  
specimen #3.  Tumor cells show strong positive immunohistochemical  
staining for GFAP. Tumor cells that are gemistocytic in appearance are  
present focally.  Numerous mitotic figures are identified.  The Ki67  
proliferation index of the tumor is 16%.  No ganglion cell component of  
the tumor is identified on chromogranin or neurofilament  
immunohistochemical stain.  The majority of tumor cell nuclei show  
positive immunohistochemical staining for p53.  While scattered tumor  
cells show immunohistochemical staining for EMA, this neoplasm does not  
show histologic features of an ependymoma and is best classified as  
Anaplastic Astrocytoma.  The possibility that this neoplasm arose from  
a lower grade tumor cannot be excluded.  Case was reviewed in  
conference with

the parenchyma. The tumor has a prominent myxoid and microcystic architecture. The principle tumor cells resemble fibrillary astrocytes, but minor populations of small gemistocytes as well as cells with perinuclear halos are also seen. There is generally mild atypia with a few scattered moderately atypical nuclei. Mitotic figures are not seen. There is no microvascular proliferation or mecrosis.    
Addendum Description:  
 
MIB -1 activity is highly variable within the tumor. In the most proliferative regions, a 
labeling index of 10.4% is calculated. In this areas, an occasional mitosis, which was not 
noted on the H&E sections, is also seen. This labeling index is significantly higher than expected in a grade II astrocytoma. Nevertheless, the overall histologic features do not warrant classification as anaplastic grade III. Based on the high prolifer ation activity, it is 
possible that this tumor is undergoing early anaplastic progression and close clinical follow up is warranted.

SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT 
COMMENT: 
This glioblastoma has an element of oligodendroglioma within it, 
comprising 
approximately 20% of neoplastic cells. Perhaps more 
morphologically 
impressive is the high degree of angiogenesis and the extensive 
reactive 
stromal component associated with it. In the majority of this 
stromal 
reaction, the matrix has a myxoid appearance \'lhereas in others of 
the stroma 
has a more highly spindled and collagen-rich. These stromal 
 elements are 
interpreted as a reactive process associated with the angiogenesis 
because of 
the geographic association of these two processes. FISH analysis 
of EGFR and 
1p/19q have been ordered and the results ,·lill be issued in a 
separate 
report. Tissue has been sent for MGMT analysis and the results

Microscopic  
 
Permanent section of the frozen section ;specimen demonstrates a mildly to moderately hypercellular glial neoplasm that diffusely infiltrates the parenchyma.  A large area of biopsy demonstrates extensive dystrophic calcification with adjacent and intermingled tumor cells.  The tumor cells have round to oval nuclei and few apparent processes.  Atupia is mild to moderate.  No mitotic figures are seen.  
 Addendum  
 Sections demonstrate a markedly hypercellular diffusely infiltrative glioma essentially as previously described.  Again, the tumor cells quiet consistently have perinuclear halos.  Nuclei tend to be round, although some oblong nuclei are seen.  Atypia is generally moderate.  Although proliferative activity is variable,  
up to 17 mitoses are seen in 10 high power fields.  Microvascular proliferation is present and there is a single focus of non pseudopalisading necrosis.  
Numerous MIB -1 reactive cells are present throughout the tumor.  A labeling 
index of 39.8% is calculat ed.

Histologic sections show a glial neoplasm with low grade and high grade components.
Eachcomponent represents approximately 50% of the tumor, which spans an estimated 7 cm.
some
of the low grade component of the neoplasm shows features of oligodendroglioma with
smallround nuclei and perinuclear clearing. Substantial areas of the neoplasm represent
high
grade glioma with more angulated and hyperchromatic nuclei more characteristic of
astrocytic features. Prominent areas of gemistocytic and mini-gemistocytic
cytologic
features are present. A few scattered mitotic figures are identified but are not
numerous.
Focal necrosis is noted but represents less than 5% of the neoplasm. Surgical
margins are

    Comment:  
This oligoastrocytoma has sm all areas of increased cellularity,  
increase pleomorphism and increased mitotic rate.  The Ki67  
proliferation index in these small areas of both specimen #1 and #3  
approach 15%.  Additionally, a small focus of endothelial proliferation is identified on the actual frozen tissue section slides of specimen #1  
but this endothelial proliferation area is not present on the permanent  
sections.  While the major portions of both specimens #1 and #3 display  
WHO grade II features, the identification of the small foci of  
anaplasia and elevated Ki67 proliferation indices suggest that this  
oligoastrocytoma will behave as an anaplastic oligoastrocytoma, WHO  
grade III.  Clinical correlation recommended.  
  
  
This diagnostic report has been personally interpreted by the signatory  
of record.  
    Microscopic Description:  
  Specimen #1 is composed primarily of neoplastic fibrillary astrocytes.  
A small focus of endothelial proliferation is identified on the actual  
frozen section slides.  The Ki67 proliferation index and mitotic rate  
is low in the major portion of specimen #1.  A very small focus of  
increase cellularity is however present on the permanent sections of  
specimen #1.  In this small focus of increas e cellularity of specimen  
#1, the Ki67 proliferation index approaches 15%.  Specimen #3 shows  
 areas
 of oligodendroglial differentiation.  Microcalcifications are  
identified in areas of tumor is specimen #3.  Small foci of increased  
cellularity, increased cellular pleomorphism and increased mitotic  
activity are identified in specimen #3.  The Ki67 proliferation index  
in these areas of increased cellularity and pleomorphism in specimen #3  
approaches 15%.  
  
 This tumor is an oligoastrocytoma. While the major portions of both 
specimens #1 and #3 display WHO grade II features, the identification  
of the small foci of anaplasia and elevated Ki67 proliferation indices  
in both specimens suggest that this oligoastrocytoma will behave as an  
anaplastic oligoastrocytoma,  WHO grade III.  Clinical correlation  
recommended.  
  A separate report with the results of FISH analysis of 1p19q status of  
the tumor will be issued.

This diagnostic report has been personally interpreted by the signatory  
of record.  
      Data Analysis:  
  DESC RIPTION OF THE ASSAY: 1p and 19q FISH studies were performed on  
paraffin embedded tumor sections. Two hybridizations were performed:  
one with a 1p/1q probe/control pair and one with a 19q/19p  
probe/control pair.  The 19q and 1p probes map to regions that are  
commonly deleted in gliomas.  The nuclei are counterstained with DAPI  
and the cells examined by epi -fluorescence microscopy.  The total  
 number 
of counts for each probe is determined in 200 cells and the  
ratios of 1p/1q and 19q/19p are calculated.  
  
Norm al range: The normal ratio is approximately 1. Any ratio > 0.80 is  
considered normal.  
  LIMITATIONS: Low levels of malignant cells in the specimen can result  
in a false negative result. As with all laboratory tests, sampling  
error and other factors may aff ect the outcome of the assay.  
Correlation of results with other clinical and laboratory data should  
be obtained.  
  COMMENT: This test was developed and its performance characteristics  
determined by the Molecular Pathology Laboratory at 
. It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S.  
Food and Drug Administration.  
This test is not to be used as a diagnostic procedure without  
confirmation of the diagnosis by another medically established product  
or procedure.

The results of this assay are reported below:
MGMT Methylation Assay:
Result: Gene Methylation•NOT detected.
Methylation Score: 1.35
--REFERENCE VALUE--
unmethylated <2.00
methylated >=2.00
Background:
MGMT [0(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase] is a DNA repair enzyme that is
involved in the repair of damage caused by a variety of DNA crosslinking compounds,
including alkylating agents. Increased methylation of the MGMT gene promotor
region causes diminished or silenced expression of the gene, making cells more
sensitive to DNA damage. This relationship has been shown for glioblastomas and
alkylating agents such as temozolomide. Approximately 40-50% of glioblastomas
exhibit MGMT gene methylation. Retrospective studies have shown that detection of
MGMT promotor methylation in tumor samples is associated with an increased
likelihood of a favorable response to.temozolomide.
Methodology:
DNA is isolated from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens.
Molecular analysis of the MGMT gene is performed by methylation-specific PCR and
detected on AB17900. The MGMT and beta-Actin copy numbers are used to calculate
the ratio of MGMT/beta-Actin x1000. Molecular-based testing is highly accurate,
but as in any laboratory test, rare diagnostic errors may occur. Results of this
test are for Investigational Purposes Only. The performance characteristics of
this assay have been determined by The result should not be used as a
diagnostic procedure without confirmation of the diagnosis by another medically
established diagnostic product or procedure.

icroscopic  
 
Sections demonstrate gray and white matter which extensively infiltrated by a glioma, the cells of which resemble protoplasmic and fibrillary astrocytes.  Microcystic change is focally striking.  The cellularity is generally low and atypia mild.  There are areas in which there is moderate hypercellularity and atypia ranges from generally moderate with a few highly atypical nuclei.  A rare mitotic figure is seen and there is no microvascular proliferation nor necrosis.  
 Adde ndum  
 Scattered MIB -1 reactive cells are present with a calculated labeling index of 
2.9%, indicative of a modestly proliferative neoplasm.  The low level of proliferative activity argues against anaplasitic progression of this tumor.

CLINICAL HISTORY:
Brain neoplasm frontal. MRI findings: A heterogeneous enhancing mass is seen
centered in the left frontal lobe which measures approximately 6.8 x 4.4 cm.
This is not significantly changed compared to prior outside MRI. There is
again significant mass effect with effacement of sulci and herniation of the
left frontal hemisphere across the midline. There is surrounding T1
hypodensity which likely represents vasogenic edema. Central areas of low Ti
signal intensity likely represent necrosis.

icroscopic  
 
Sections designated as “parietal tumor or parietal pericystic” demonstrate infiltrating or mildly cellular diffuse glioma.  The tumor cells are characterized by round nuclei that lack obvious processes and perinuclear halos.  The sections that are designated as arising inone of two cysts show markedly hypercellular tumor with essentially identical histologic features.  They do have modestly greater hyperchromasia but this may reflect cell density.  Only rare mitotic figures  
are seen.  There is no microvascular proliferation or necrosis.  
 Addendum  
 MIB-1 reactivity varies significantly within the tumor.  It ranges from 0.7% in the 
least proliferative areas up to 9.7%.  Whereas this is worrisome for early anaplastic progression, the diagnosis f grade III anaplastic oligodendroglioma cannot be made on this alone.

COMMENT: The neoplasm throughout has an overall morphology of
oligodendroglioma with classical ""chicken-wire"" microvasculature,
somewhat uniform cellularity, extensive microvascular calcification,
and diffuse infiltration of the gray matter. However, focally the
neoplasm appears fibrillary and somewhat astrocytic. In addition,
mitotic figures are occasionally found, but microvascular cellular proliferation is absent ,and there are no areas of necrosis. Special
stains are being requested to better characterize the neoplasm, and an
addendum report will follow.
ADDENDUM REPORT
SPECIAL STAINS :Bielschowsky stain was performed on section from block
#4.
The stain demonstrates various densities of axons throughout the tumor.
IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY :Immunoperoxidase methods for GFAP, p53,
synaptophysin ,and MIB -1 were performed on sections from block #4.
The GFAP depicts reactive astrocytosis throughout the zones of the
brain parenchyma infiltrated by the tumor. In these zones there is
background synaptophysin immunoreactivity ,and rarely a ganglion cell
has perikaryal positivity (interpreted as entrapped native neurons).
where there is solid tumor, there is no synaptophysin or GFAP reaction,
and with the MIB-1 a proliferation index of 7% is determined. The
diagnosis remains as above.
MICROSCOPIC: 6 blocks ,6 slides, 1 special stain ,4 immunoperoxidase
stains.

Microscopic Description:  
The tumor is composed of moderately pleomorphic glial cells.  The glial  
tumor cells infiltrate cerebral grey matter and cortical neurons are  
present that are surrounded by tumor cells.  Many tumor cells show  
positive immunohistochemical staining for GFAP.  No ganglion cell  
component of the tumor is identified on chromogranin  
immunohistochemical stain.  Many tumor cell nuclei show positive  
immunohistochemical staining for p53.  
  The Ki67 proliferation index of this neoplasm is 1.9%.  
  This infiltrating glial neoplasm is best classified as astrocytoma, WHO

Results-Comments 
Testing perfOrmed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block. 
DNA.extracted from a corresponding blood specimen was used as normal

TEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA 
(baseline)/ Tumor DNA pairs using 3 markers at both lp and 19q. The 3 
markers 
on lp are D1S548, DlS1592, and D1S552 (with DlS468, D1S1612, and 
D1S496 as

PLA2G4C 
(with D19S606 and D19S1182 as backup) . All markers are microsatellites 
(2 or 4 
nt repeats) except PLA2G4C which is a minisatellite (26 nt repeat) 
polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score, 
amplicon size, and ease-of interpretation. The backup markers are used 
if the 
first line markers at that chromosome arm are uninformative or 
·.otherwise 
 ambiguous in their interpretation. LOH at all informative loci on each

COMMENT 
Part A is portions of cerebral cortex and adjacent white matter, in which 
there are focal areas of recent edema. There is no neoplasia. 
Parts Band C are portions of cerebral cortex and adjacent white matter 
infiltrated and extensively effaced by a glial neoplastic proliferation with 
nuclear anaplasia, mitotic figures, microvascular cellular proliferation, and 
necrosis, some with pseudopalisading, i.e. a glioblastoma. 
Part 0 is small fragments of unremarkable cerebral cortex and adjacent white 
matter devoid of neoplasm. 
Special stains results will be reported as an addendum.

Results-Comments 
IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY: The GFAP demonstrates gliofibrillogenesis by the 
neoplastic cells, and frequent gemistocytes. Only about 3% of the neoplastic 
nuclei express the p53 mutant protein. With the MIB-1 there is a 
proliferation index of about 14% throughout the tumor. 
Comment: The immunophenotype is consistent with a glioblastoma. The 
diagnosis remains unchanged.

A. Received fresh, several fragments, 1.8 em across in aggregate. 
Semi-firm, grayish-white, glistening. In total #1-4. 
INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION: Brain, left frontal: Malignant 
neoplasm, 
consistent with glioma. 
B. Received fresh, several fragments, 3.5 em across in aggregate. 
Semi-firm, grayish-white, glistening. In total #5-8. 
MICROSCOPIC: A,B. Portions of a glial neoplastic proliferation. The 
neoplastic cells are medium-sized, have hyperchromatic pleomorphic 
nuclei, and the nuclear outline tends to be elongated or ovoid. In 
the 
background there is a uniform finely fibrillary internuclear space. 
Throughout the neoplasm there are branching small vessels, frequently 
arciform. There are frequent mitotic figures, and there are focal 
areas of tumor necrosis and prominent microvascular cellular 
proliferation. Rather iarely, ther~ are clear halos around neoplastic 
nuclei. In a couple of areas there is chunky microcalcification. 
SPECIAL STAINS: Irnrnunoperoxidase methods for GFAP and MIB-1 ~;ere 
performed on sections from block #2. 
The GFAP highlights the fine gliofibrillary background. With the MIB-
1, a proliferation index of 22% is determined in the more active 
areas. 
COMMENT: The neoplasm is a solid cellular glial neoplastic 
proliferation with features of anaplasia, including prominent nuclear 
pleomorphism and atypia, prominent mitotic activity, and focal tumor 
necrosis with focal microvascular cellular proliferation. The 
proliferation index is high at about 22% The predominant cellular 
 pattern and architecture are interpreted as oligodendroglial in 
natu~e, 
however with some astrocytic component. This neoplasm could also be 
classified as anaplastic oligodendroglioma. "," 1. ""Site"": Brain, left frontal. Justified as the report mentioned a left frontal brain excision.

A: Brain, left frontal brain tumor, biopsy

Pathologic Diagnosis
A. Brain ,left frontal brain tumor ,biopsy:
1. Necrotic tumor and brain tissue.
2. Scant viable tumor cells.
3. Radiation induced changes.
B. Brain ,left frontal brain tumor ,biopsy:
1. Recurrent /residual oligoastrocytoma.
2. Radiation induced changes (see comment).
Comment
Scant viable tumor is present in specimen A. and definite viable tumor is present in specimen B. Tumor
cells show
moderately pleomorphic round to oval to angulated nuclei. Mitotic figures are rare .Necrosis, astrogliosis,vascular
changes and chronic inflammation related to radiation therapy are noted. Immunohistochemicalstains areperformed
on specimen B. GFAP demonstrated reactive astrogliosis and highlights occasional tumor cells. The Ki-67 labeling
index is approximately 2 to 3% in the tumor areas of lower cellularity and approximately 5 to 10% in areasof higher
cellularity, but this higher activity is often associated with chronic inflammation and/or vascular changes.
With the exception of the radiation induced changes, the remaining tumor appears histologically similar tothe patient's
previous specimen in terms of histopathological grade being. Some mild microvascular proliferation is
noted, but is not
definitely associated with tumor, as it also appears in areas of reactive gliosis, and may be secondary toradiation.
Convincing histopathological evidence for definite transformation from a WHO grade II to grade III lesion
is lacking.
This could be due to sampling phenomenon. The fact that the lesion shows new enhancing fociradiologically however
suggeststhat it has progressed to a WHO grade I I I lesion. Clinical correlation is required.

(bisulfite) modification of unmethylated, but not methylated, cytosines to 
uracil and subsequent peR using primers specific for either methylated or the 
modified unmethylated DNA (  The 
PCR products were analyzed in duplicate parallel runs by capillary gel

INTERPRETATION: 
MGMT (06 methylguaine DNA methyltransferase) is a DNA repair gene. Methylation 
of the promotor leads to gene silencing and loss of MGMT expression. a recent 
study that tested the methylation status of the same region of the MGMT 
promoter in glioblastomas found that MGMT promoter methylation was an 
independent favorable prognostic factor and was associated with a survival 
benefit in patients treated with temozolamide and radiotherapy.

CLINICAL :
Right frontal lobe tumour.
MACROSCOPIC:
A discoid piece of brain 75 x 65 x l6mm, including cortex and white matter. The
cerebral surface has a bulging appearance due to pronounced swelling of several
adjacent gyr'i causing sulcal compression, over an area of approximately 40 x
30mm. Serial sections show marked cortical thickening in areas measu ring up to
1mm in thickness. The underlying white may also be expanded but difficult to
judge and within this region there is loss of cortico-medullary demarcation.
Within the grey matter ia a imm cystic space filled with altered blood (looks
traumatic). The adjacent brain parenchyma appears within normal limits. Brain
surface and 2 sections (cut face) photographed. Tissue submitted for FM and
cytoge.net ice
BLOCKKEY:
1-8:lesional brain, 9, 10:cortical blood clot, 11-14:ncrma.l appearing brain
parenchyma
MICROSCOPIC:
Representative sections of lesional brain show grey and white matter with a
diffusely infiltrating glioma of variable cellularity. The neoplastic cells are
set within a fibrrillary and focally microcystic stroma and display a range of
morphological features. The predominant cell type has intermediate sized, round
to oval and also spindly nuclei with a vesicular chromatin pattern. There is
mild pleomorphism and occasional prominent nuc.Leoli are seen. Some cells have
perinuclear clearing resembling oligodendrocytes. Within other areas of the
tumour are cells with larger irregular oval nuclei which are favoured. to be
astrocytic. Focal zones with a spindled morphology are also present.. Some
areas contain moderate numbers of gemistocytic cells, including some min.i.-
gem:istocytes. Mitotic activity is variable and some areas do show moderate
activity. The MIB-1 proliferation index remains low, with approximately 5%% of
cells showing positive staining. There is no evidence of necrosis. A moderate
I.ymphoplasmacyti.c infiltrate is seen within the Virchow-Robin space. FISH
studies pending.
CONCLUSION:
Right frontal lobe tumour (preliminary report) : Preliminary hi,topathology
favours a WHO Grade III astrocytoma not excluding the possibility of a mixed
oligoastrocytoma. FISH studies for ip and 19q deletions and EGFR amplification
are being performed and results will be issued in a supplementary report.

Microscopic Description:  
Sections demonstrate a hypercellular glial neoplasm compose of two phenotypic 
populations of neoplastic cells. The astrocytic component of the tumor consists perdominantly of cells w ith gemistocytic features, including eccentric moderately 
plemorphic nuclei and abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm. The oligodendrocytic component of the tumor is characterized by numerous neoplastic cells with round to oval nuclei and prominent perinuclear halos. The two populations of tumor cells in some areas are intermixed and in others areas appear separate. Overall, the ctyologic atypia appears moderate. There is a background of microcystic change. The tumor diffusely infiltrates adjacent brain parenchyma. Scattered mitotic figures are seen. Microvascular proliferation is prevalent. Foci of early micronecrosis are seen. The low mitotic activity of the tumor (up to 2 mitoses per 10 high power fields) and the moderate degree of pleomorphism would suggest a low grade glioma; however, the presence of prominent microvascular proliferation and foci of early necrosis are concerning for a high grade tumor. A final diagnosis will be issued pending review of MIB-1.    
Addendum Discussion:  
The MIB -1 labeling index ranges up to 6.9% in the most proliferative regions of tumor. 
The elevated MIB -1 labeling index, in conjunction with the immunohistochemical 
features support an oligoastrocytoma with features concerning for early anaplastic 
progression. The findings of early micronecrosis and microvascular proliferation are worrisome for anaplastic progression. The degree of necrosis is not felt to be substantial 
enough to classify this tumor as a glioblastoma with oligodendroglial differentiation; however, this neoplasm should be closely followed.   
Diagnosis: 
Oligoastrocytoma with early anaplastic progression. MIB -1 Labeling Index= 6.9%

COMMENT 
The frozen section diagnosis is confirmed on permanent sections. 
The biopsy shows brain tissue infiltrated by a neoplasm composed of 
mildly 
pleomorphic glial cells. The cells are tightly packed and demonstrate 
perinuclear clearing in some areas. Focal microvascular proliferation 
is also 
seen in some areas along with frequent calcospherites. Areas of 
necrosis are 
also noted. Mitoses range from 3 to 4 per ten 400x fields. 
The tumor cells are diffusely highlighted by GFAP, while p53 stain 
shows 
diffuse weak to moderate positivity of the tumor nuclei. CD163 stains 
rare 
phagocytic cells. The Ki-67 labeling index is approximately 25%. 
Positive and negative controls show appropriate immunoreactivity. 
Molecular studies showed LOH for 1p/19q (see procedure addenda below).

POSITIVE: Methylated MGMT promoter is detected. 
Results-Comments 
Testing performed on paraffin tissue block Pending 
 
H stained slide was examined for subsequent tumor 
dissection. 
Sufficient tumor cells were present in the tissue block and no 
microdissection 
was needed. 
TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT 
promoter 
have been shown to benefit from therapy with alkylating agents. 
Assessment of 
MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite treatment of DNA 
followed 
by real-time PCR amplification (MethyLight) of methylated and 
unmethylated DNA 
sequences. The analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by 
serial 
dilution of methylated positive control DNA into unmethylated DNA, and 
was 
assessed to be 1% of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated 
DNA. 
Factors such as the presence of >50% non-neoplastic cells in the 
sample1 or 
extensive tissue necrosis, may preclude the detection of methylated 
MGMT 
promoter sequences.

POSITIVE: Allelic loss on chromosome arm lp and chromosome arm 19q is 
detected. 
 Informative loci are: D1Sl592, D1S552, D19S219, D19S412, and PLA2G4C 
Results-Comments 
Test performed on DNA extracted from tumor tissue paraffin block and 
peripheral blood for germline comparison. 
TEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA 
(baseline)/ Tumor DNA pairs using 3 markers at both lp and 19q. The 3 
markers 
on lp are DlS548, D1S1592, and DlS552 (with DlS468, D1Sl612, and 
D1S496 as 
backup markers) and the 3 markers on 19q are Dl9S219, D19S412, and 
PLA2G4C 
(with D19S606 and D19Sl182 as backup) . All markers are microsatellites 
(2 or 4 
nt repeats) except PLA2G4C which is a minisatellite (26 nt repeat) 
polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score, 
amplicon size, and ease of interpretation. The backup markers are used 
if the 
first line markers at that chromosome arm are uninformative or 
otherwise 
ambiguous in their interpretation. LOH at all informative loci on each 
chromosomal arm represents the typical finding in oligodendrogliomas 
with 1p 
and 19q deletion.

SECTIONS: The specimen is submitted entirely in 3 cassettes. 
MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION 
Sections of specimens A. and B. show a pleomorphic epithelioid neoplasm 
demonstrating prominent nucleoli. In Some areas the tumor cells are arranged 
in a nested pattern. Occasional gland-like structures apparently containing 
secretory material are noted. Most of the tumor is composed of large 
epithelioid cells although some areas are composed of smaller cells with scant 
cytoplasm. Frequent mitotic figures, occasional apoptotic bodies and large 
areas of necrosis are present. Microvascular proliferation and 
pseudopalisading necrosis are not prominent features. Immunohistochemical 
stains show that he tumor is GFAP, vimentin and SlOO positive. RMB-45 and 
pan-keratin are negative. Occasional cells show diffuse EMA cytoplasmic 
positivity. The reticulin pattern is somewhat biphasic as are the GFAP and 
vimentin staining patterns. The tumor is diffusely p53 positive and the Ki-67 
labeling index is 30 to 40%.

Operation/Specimen: A: Brain, tumor, biopsy 
B: Residual tumor, excision biopsy 
PATHOI.OGICAL DIAGNOSIS: 
A. Bn1in, left frontal tumor, excision biopsy: Anapla.'3tic 
oligodendroglioma 
vlllO Grade (III) (see comment). 
B. Brain, residual tumor, excision biopsy: Cerebral tissue with 
sparse 
infiltrating oligodendroglioma cells (see comment) . 
COMMENT 
Permanent sections of A confirm the frozen section diagnosis. Sections 
show a 
mild to moderately pleomorphic glioma with mostly round to oval 
nuclei. Focal 
dense cellularity, occasional mitoses and early microvascular 
proliferation 
are noted. The tumor is diffusely GFAP positive, highlighting numerous 
gliofibrillary oligodendrocytes. The Ki-67 labeling index is 
approximately up 
to 5%. Sections of B show mostly white matter with rare to occasional 
enlarged 
atypical cells that positive for Ki-67. 
This tumor shows mostly oligodendroglial features but shows some 
pleomorphism 
consistent with the ""polymorphic variant of Zulch"" type of 
oligodendroglioma,  usually considered grade III. There may also be a minor astrocytic 
component. 
Results of additional ancillary studies will be reported below in

PROCEDURE8/ADDENDA 
Loss of Heter~lp, 19q Assay I11III 
Date Ordered:1IIIIIIIII Date Reported: 
Interpretation 
NEGATIVE: Allelic loss on chromosome arm 1p and chromosome arm 19q is 
NOT 
detected. 
Informative loci are: D18548, D18552, D198412, D198606 and D1981182 
Results-Comments 
Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block. DNA 
extracted from a corresponding blood specimen was used as a normal 
reference 
control. 
TEST DE8CRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA 
(baseline)/ Tumor DNA pairs using 3 markers at both 1p and 19q. The 3 
markers 
on 1p are D18548, 0181592, and 01S552 (with 018468, 0181612, and 
018496 as 
backup markers) and the 3 markers on 19q are 0198219, 0198412, and 
PLA2G4C 
(with 0198606 and 01981182 as backup). All markers are microsatellites 
(2 or 4 
nt repeats) except PLA2G4C which is a minisatellite (26 nt repeat) 
polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score, 
amplicon size, and ease of interpretation. The backup markers are used 
if the 
first line markers at that chromosome arm are uninformative or 
otherwise 
ambiguous in their interpretation. LOR at all informative loci on each 
chromosomal arm represents the typical finding in oligodendrogliomas 
with 1p 
and 19q deletion. 
FOA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results 
from a 
stand-alone diagnostic test. This test was developed and its

specific uses by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA 
has 
determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These 
results are 
provided for informational purposes only, and should be interpreted 
only in 
the context of established procedures and/or diagnostic criteria. 
TECHNICAL SENSITIVITY: The presence of >15% non-neoplastic cells in 
the sample 
may preclude the detection of allelic loss. 
. .. -. . .. . 
Interpretation 
NEGATIVE: No evidence of methylated MGMT promoter is detected. 
Results-Comments 
Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block 
Hand E slide was examined and no microdissection was needed. 
TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT 
promoter 
have been shown to benefit from therapy with alkylating agents. 
Assessment of 
MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite treatment of DNA 
followed 
by real-time PCR amplification (MethyLight) of methylated and 
unmethylated DNA 
sequences. The analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by 
serial 
dilution of methylated positive control DNA into unmethylated DNA, and 
\vas 
assessed to be 1% of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated 
DNA. 
Factors such as the presence of >50% non-neoplastic cells in the 
sample, or 
extensive tissue necrosis, may preclude the detection of methylated 
MGMT 
promoter sequences. 
FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results

Imaging 
studies show a left frontal, heterogeneous, somewhat enhancing intra­
axial 
tumor. 
OPERATIVE DIAGNOSES 
. Left frontal ""'brain .lesion. 
Operation/Specimen: A: Brain, left frontal, excision biopsy 
PATHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS: 
A. Brain, left frontal lesion, excision: Oligodendroglioma (NHO Grade 
II) (see 
comment). 
COMMENT 
Sections show an oligodendroglioma with areas of microcystic change. 
Focal 
mo~erately hypercellular areas are present, however mitotic figures 
are not 
cOnspicuous. Vascular proliferation and necrosis are not seen. p53 
shows 
scattered weak to moderate reactivity. The Ki-67 labeling index is 
approximately 4% in the most cellular areas. Positive and negative 
controls 
show appropriate immunoreactivity. 
Molecular studies show allelic loss for chromosome segments lp and 
19q, and 
. the presence .. of MGf1T promotor methylation. EGFRviii mutation was not 
detected 
(see procedure.addenda below). 
======================================================================= 
PROCEDURES/ADDENDA 
POSITIVE: Allelic loss on chromosome arm lp and chromosome arm 19q is 
detected. 
 Informative loci are: DlS548, D1S1592, D1S552, D19S219, PLA2G4C 
Results-Comments 
Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block 
and a corresponding blood specimen for germline comparison. 
TEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA 
(baseline}/ .Tumor DNA pairs using 3 markers at both lp and 19q. The 3 
markers 
on lp are D1S548, D1S1592, and D1S552 (with D1S468, D1Sl612, and 
D1S496 as 
backup markers} and the 3 markers on 19q are D19S219, D19S412, and 
PLA2G4C 
(with D19S606 and D19S1182 as backup} . All markers are microsatellites 
(2 or 4 
nt .repeats} except PLA2G4C which is a minisatellite (26 nt repeat} 
polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score, 
amplicon size, and ease of interpretation. The backup markers are used if the 
first line markers at that chromosome arm are uninformative or 
otherwise 
ambiguous in their interpretation. LOH at all informative loci on each 
chromosomal arm represents the typical finding in oligodendrogliomas 
with lp 
and 19q deletion.

Results-comments 
Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block 
TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT 
promoter 
have been shown to benefit from therapy with alkylating agents. 
Assessment of 
MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite treatment of DNA 
followed 
by real-time_PCR amplification (MethyLight} of methylated and 
unmethylated DNA 
 sequences. The analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by 
serial 
dilution of methylated positive control DNA into unmethylated DNA, and 
was 
ass.essed to be 1% of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated 
DNA. 
Factors such as the presence of >50% non-neoplastic cells in the 
sample,· or

TEST DESCRIPTION: Testing performed on RNA extracted from tumor 
paraffin block 
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an attractive 
molecular target 
in. glioblastoma because it is amplified, overexpressed, and/or mutated 
in'up 
to·'40% to 50% of. patients. Epidermal growth factor receptor variant 
III 
(EGFRviii) is an oncogenic, constitutively active mutant form of EGFR 
that is 
commonly expressed in ·glioblastoma. Cell culture and in vivo models of 
glioblastoma have demonstrated EGFRviii as defining prognostically 
distinct 
subgroups of glioblastomas. Additionally, the presence of EGFRviii has 
be<;>n 
shOwn to sensitize tumors to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors when the 
tumor 
suppressor protein PTEN is intact. RNA is extracted from formalin 
fixed, 
paraffin embedded tissue samples and reverse transcribed to eDNA. The 
eDNA is 
then amplified using standard PCR technique for DNA templates. PCR 
products 
 are detected by gel electrophoresis. The limit of detection of this 
assay has 
been determined to be approximately 5 mutant cells in 100 normal 
cells.

Glial (favour otigodendroglial)
The appearance is that of a diffuse glioma with morphological features of
oligodendroglioma .There are large areas which appear WHO grade 2. but
there are also foci which are regarded as WHO grade 3, on the basis of
high cellularity, mitotic rate and some nuclear pleomorphism. The tiny
focus of possible early microvascular proliferation would be acceptable for
anaplastic (grade 3) oligodendroglioma, but would be of more concern in
an astrocytic neoplasm .Confirmation of the diagnosis of
oligodendroglioma by FISH testing for 1p19q deletion and EGFR
amplification is highly recommended (patient permission required, see

Comment:
Although a few areas of tumor appear slightly more cellular than others, no features to support progression to a higher grade are
identified in these sections. Only one mitotic figure is recognized. Some leptomeningeal vascular tissue, bearing a resemblance to
an angioma, is noted in (A), but no microvascular proliferation is detected in the current sections of tumor. Ongoing regular imaging
surveillance is suggested.

Microscopic Description:
The tumor has the well-differentiated appearance of oligodendroglioma, complete with perinuclear haloes, a delicate capillary
network, and even spacing of cells, in many areas. No calcifications are noted. A single vessel with some increase in endothelial
cells is noted (section D2); microvascular proliferation is not identified. Necrosis is not present in these sections. A single mitotic
figure is detected (F3) in an area of mild vascular hypertrophy. More closely packed cells with slightly more atypia are seen (F5),
and a focus of bluer, more atypical cells is noted focally in (A2). Infrequent p53 labeling of cells is noted (F5). MIB-1, performed on
several sections (F1, F5, A2, D2), stains relatively low numbers of nuclei. In sections from (A), several highly vascular foci of
superficial leptomeningeal tissue include back-to-back small vessels.

Sections demonstrate a moderately to markedly hypercellular neoplasm composed primarily of glial cells with round to oval nuclei with obvious processes.  There are numerous large neurons admixed within the tumor.  Many appear maloriented and some are atypical.  One possible binucleate neuron is 
seen.  These findings raise the possibility of ganglioglioma.  However, no eosinophilic granular bodies are seen.   
 In this  section, the tumor has a more overt, diffusely invasive architecture.  
Numerous  dystrophic calcifications are seen.   A finely branching vasculature is 
apparent focally, but definite oligodendroglioma differentiation with cells with perinuclear halos and few cytoplasmic processes are not seen.  No mitotic figure s are seen in more than 25 high power fields.  Neither microvascular 
proliferation  nor necrosis  are seen.  The tumor cells do demonstrate a focally 
prominent angiocentric growth pattern.  
 Addendum  
 Only a few p53 reactive cells are present, insufficient to definitely classify the 
tumor as astrocytoma.  MIB -1 activity is variable throughout the tumor.  In many

 Diagnosis  
 Anaplastic astrocytoma   grade III  
"," 1. ""Site"": Brain - The report clearly indicates that the sample is from a brain tumor.
2. ""Laterality"": Not provided - The report does not specify whether the tumor is located in the left or right hemisphere of the brain.
3. ""Histology"": Anaplastic astrocytoma - The report concludes with this diagnosis, indicating a malignant tumor of glial origin.
4. ""Stage"": Not provided - The report does not include information about the size of the tumor, its invasion into nearby structures, or the spread to distant sites, which are necessary for TNM staging.
5. ""Grade"": Grade III - This is explicitly stated in the diagnosis, indicating a high-grade tumor with poor differentiation.
6. ""Behavior"": Malignant - This is inherent in the diagnosis of anaplastic astrocytoma, as these are aggressive, invasive tumors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lung,,Adenocarcinoma,,High grade or poorly differentiated (Grade III),Malignant,TCGA-76-4929.pdf,  ," Report: 
The sample consists of a fragment of tissue with a size of 3.5 x 2.1 cm. The specimen is partially covered by a fibrous capsule. In the subcapsular region, there is a tumor focus of 1.8 cm in its greatest dimension. The tumor demonstrates diffuse growth and consists of atypical cells with hyperchromic nuclei and scant cytoplasm. Mitotic activity is high. Necrosis is present. Vascular invasion is not identified. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells show positivity for CK7, CK19, and Ki-67 (labeling index 40%). The findings are consistent with a high-grade malignant neoplasm, morphologically and immunophenotypically suspicious for a primary pulmonary adenocarcinoma.

1. Site: Lung. Justification - The report mentions the findings to be consistent with a primary pulmonary adenocarcinoma.
2. Laterality: Not provided. Justification - The report does not specify whether the left or right lung is affected.
3. Histology: Adenocarcinoma. Justification - The report suggests a high-grade malignant neoplasm, morphologically and immunophenotypically suspicious for a primary pulmonary adenocarcinoma.
4. Stage: Not provided. Justification - The report does not contain information regarding the TNM stage of the tumor.
5. Grade: High grade or poorly differentiated (Grade III). Justification - The report mentions high-grade malignant neoplasm, indicating a high grade for this cancer.

icroscopic 
Sctions demonstrate a mildly to moderately hypercellular glial neoplasm, the cells of which resemble moderately to markedly atypical fibrillar and gemistocytic astocytes.  There is prominent multifocal perivascular lymphocyti c inflammation.  
Neither oligodendroglioma nor ganglion cell differentiation is seen.  No microvascular proliferation or necrosis is identified.  Whereas no mitotic figures are identified, in what appears to be a purely astrocytic lineage tumor, the atypia alone is sufficient for classification as anaplastic grade 3.  However, MIB -1 
immunohistochemistry will be performed to better  assess tumor proliferative activity.  
 Addendum  
 Numberous MIB -1 reactive cells are present throughout the specimen.  The 
labeli ng index of 16.3% is calculated, consistent with the otherwise high grade

Addendum Discussion:  
Sections demonstrate benign cerebellum with degenerative changes including neuronal loss and gliosis. There is moderately cellular neoplasm composed of cells that resemble modestly atypical fibrillary astrocytes. In general, the tumor appears to have an expanded interface with the adjacent cerebellum. Scattered Rosenthal fibers are present, primarily at the periphery of the tumor. The tumor has a solid growth pattern. Vascular hyalinization is seen and there are numerous microcalcifications. In some areas the calcifications predominate over the tumor cells. No atypical ganglion cells are seen and no eosinophilic granular bodies are noted. Perivascular pseudo rosettes are not noted.

M A.CROSCOPIC EXAMINATION
Labelled ""Brain tumour"".
Specimen consists of two irregular pieces of soft to firm cream tissue
measuring ex5x2mm and 19xiOx6mm.
MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
Sections show brain tissue with focal areas of increased cellularity and in
some of these areas there are vacuol.ated cells (abundant cytoplasm) with
central nuclei and slightly pleom.orphic hyperchromatic nuclei seen (high
mi.t:a tic count is seen in some areas up to 4/1UPF x40) . I think it is
consistent with oLigodendrogliotic cells mixed with astrocytic cells.
The adjacent brain tissue also shows a slight increase in cellularity
al.-hough there is less pleomorphism in this and no fried egg like areas.
There is no evidence or necrosis. There area also branching networks of
capillary seen.
The GFAP certainly demonstrated a network of astrocyt'i `cells however in the
oligodendrogliotic area the stromal clear cell in the-centre-of this

L .. Oligodendroglioma, with atypical features. 
MIB-1 proliferation index: 18%. 
See· Mic.ioscopy Description and Comrnent. 
COMMENT 
The specimens contain portions of cerebrum that are lightly to heavily 
infiltrated by a neoplastic proliferation of glial cells that have an 
oligodendroglial phenotype. There is only slight nuclear 
pleomorphism, rarely 
one mitotic figure, but a high MIB-1 proliferation index of about 18% 
in focal 
more cellular areas. There is occasionally endothelial hyperplasia, 
but.no 
microvascular cellular proliferation. There is not necrosis. 
The neoplasm is an oligodendroglioma with low histological grade 
features. 
However, the focal endothelial hyperplasia and elevated proliferation 
index 
may portend enhanced biological activity. 
The pathological findings may be correlated with clinical, imaging, 
and 
oPerative findings for their final interpretation and patient's follow 
up.

TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT 
promoter 
have been shown to benefit from therapy with alkylating agents. 
Assessment of 
MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite treatment of DNA 
follo~1ed 
by·real-time .. PCR amplification (MethyLight) of methylated and 
unmethylated DNA 
s~quences. The ·analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by 
serial 
dilution of methylated positive control DNA into unmethylated DNA, and 
was 
assessed to be 1% of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated 
DNA. 
Factors such as the presence of >50% non-neoplastic cells in the 
sample, or 
extensive tissue necrosis, may preclude the detection of methylated 
MGMT 
promoter sequences.

markers 
on lp are DlS548, D1S1592, and D1S552 (with D1S468, DlS1612, and

PLA2G4C 
(with D19S60G and Dl9Sl182 as backup) . All markers are microsatellites 
(2. or 4 
nt repeats) except PLA2G4C which is a minisatellite (26 nt repeat) 
polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score, 
amplicon size, and ease of interpretation. The backup markers are used 
if the 
first line markers at -that chromosome arm are uninformative or 
otherwise 
ambiguous in their interpretation. LOH at all informative loci on each

 Microscopic  Discussion:  
 Sections demonstrate a mildly hypercellular glial neoplasm that diffusely infiltrates both gray and white matter.  The tumor cells have round to oblong nuclei with only mild atypia.  Although they do not have prominent glial processes, only rarely are perinuclear halos seen.  In the gray matter, the tumor does demonstrate focally prominent perineuronal satellitosis.  No mitotic figures are seen.  There is no microvascular proliferation or necrosis.  
 Addendum D iscussion :

The sample consists of a fragment of tissue with a neoplastic proliferation of atypical cells arranged in nests and cords. The tumor cells have moderate to severe atypia, hyperchromasia, and increased mitotic activity. Immunohistochemistry is positive for CK7, CK20, and CDX-2, consistent with a colorectal primary. There is no evidence of lymphovascular or perineural invasion. The tumor involves the muscularis propria but does not invade through it. No lymph nodes are identified in the sample.

1. Site: Colon - Justification: The immunohistochemistry results indicate a colorectal primary, and no other site is mentioned in the report.
2. Laterality: Not provided - Justification: The report does not specify whether the left or right colon is affected.
3. Histology: Adenocarcinoma - Justification: The report describes a neoplastic proliferation of atypical cells arranged in nests and cords, which is consistent with adenocarcinoma.

COMMENT:
Sections show a hypercellular glial neoplasm composed of gemistocytic astrocytes and smaller elongate
cells with high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio, and markedly hyperchromatic nuclei. Mitotic figures are
easily identified. There is no evidence of necrosis or microvascular proliferation. These features are
most consistent with an anaplastic astrocytoma with gemistocytic features, WHO grade III.
Immunohistochemical stains were performed and evaluated at show that the tumor cells are
strongly positive for p53 protein and IDH1 (R132H) mutant protein, the latter of which is generally
associated with a genetically more favorable subtype of diffuse glioma. The GFAP stain shows patchy
positivity, especially in the gemistocytic cells. Neurofilament stains the entrapped neuropil. The Ki-67
labeling index is 18%.
Fluorescence in situ hybridization studies for EGFR amplification and PTEN deletion will be performed at

Calculated ip/lq ratio = 0.98 (<0.74 is.deleted)
Calculated 19q/19p ratio = 0.90 (<0.88 is deleted)
The results are interpreted as not deleted for both lp and 19q.
A result of a deleted ip and 19q suggests a favorable prognosis. A solitary ip
deletion suggests an intermediate prognosis. A 19q solitary deletion may suggest a
favorable prognosis in a smaller subset of tumors. The lack of either ip and/or
19q deletion(s) is considered a poor prognostic indicator and may be associated
with decreased disease-free survival and overall survival.

MGMT METHYLATION ASSAY : GENE METHYLATION DETECTED.
MGMT Methylation Assay was performed on sections from block ""2A"" by The-
results of this assay are reported below:
MGMT Methylation Assay:
Result: Gene Methylation detected.
Methylation Score: ,27.13
--REFERENCE VALUE--
unmethylated <2.00
methylated >=2.00
Background:
MGMT (0 (6) -methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase] is a DNA repair enzyme that is
involved in the repair of damage caused by a variety of. DNA crosslinking compounds,
including alkylating agents. Increased methylation-of the MGMT gene promotor
region causes diminished or silenced expression of the gene, making cells more
sensitive to DNA damage. This relationship has been shown for glioblastomas and
alkylating agents such as temozolomide. Approximately 40-50% of glioblastomas
exhibit MGMT gene methylation. Retrospective studies have shown that detection of
MGMT promotor methylation in tumor samples is associated with an increased
likelihood of a favorable response to temozolomide.
Methodology:
DNA is isolated from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens.
Molecular analvsia of the'MGMT gene is performed by methylation-specific PCR and
detected on The MGMT and beta-Actin copy numbers are used to calculate
the ratio of MGMT/beta-Actin x 1000. Molecular-based testing is highly accurate,
but as in any laboratory test,. rare diagnostic errors may occur. Results of this
test are for Investigational Purposes Only, The performance characteristics of
this assay have been determined by The result should not be used as a
diagnostic procedure without confirmation of the diagnosis by another medically
established diagnostic product or procedure.

The portions of cerebrum show an infiltrating glial neoplastic proliferation that has an
phenotype. Mitoticastrocytic
figures are identified, and the Ki-67/ MIB-1 proliferation index is greater than 10%. There are abnormal
blood vessels,
with a mitosis identified in the endothelial layer of one vessel. There is no tumor necrosis seen.
Overall, the sections predominantly show a high histological grade diffuse glioma that is most consistent
with
anaplastic astrocytoma, WHO grade 3. However, the presence of mitosis in an abnormal blood vessel, as
well as
patchy post-contrast enhancement seen in the pre-operative radiology imaging studies, raise concern for
these
sections representing the periphery of a higher grade diffuse astrocytoma, i.e. glioblastoma. Correlation
with radiology

MGMT Promoter Methylation
Date Ordered : Date Reported:
Interpretation
LOW POSITIVE: Methylated MGMT promoter is detected.
Results -Comments
Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block (A3)
H and E slide was examined and tumor DNA was enriched by microdissection TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT promoter have been shown to
benefit
from therapy with alkylating agents. Assessment of MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfate
treatment of
DNA followed by real-time PCR amplification of methylated and unmethylated DNA
sequences. The
analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by serial dilution of methylated positive control DNA into
unmethylated DNA, and was assessed to be 1% of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated
DNA. Factors
such as the presence of >50% non-neoplastic cells in the sample, or extensive tissue necrosis, may
preclude the
detection of methylated MGMT promoter sequences.
FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a stand alone diagnostic
test. This test
was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the
as required
by CLIA'88 regulations. It has not been cleared or approved for specific uses by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA). The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These

Loss of Heterozygosity 1 p, 19q Assay (LOH)
Date Ordered: Date Reported:
Interpretation
NEGATIVE: Allelic loss on chromosome arm l p and chromosome arm 19q is NOT detected.
Informative loci are: D1 S548, D1 S552, D19S219, PLA2G4C
Results -Comments
Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block (A3). DNA extracted from a
corresponding blood specimen was used as a normal reference control.
H and E slide was examined and tumor DNA was enriched by microdissection
TEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA (baseline)/ Tumor DNA
pairs using 3
markers at both 1 p and 19q. The 3 markers on 1 p are D1 S548, D1 S1592, and D1 S552 (with D1 S468,
D1 S1612, and
D1 S496 as backup markers) and the 3 markers on 19q are D19S219, D19S412, and PLA2G4C (with
D19S606 and
D19S1182 as backup). All markers are microsatellites (2 or 4 nt repeats) except PLA2G4C which is a
minisatellite (26
nt repeat) polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score, amplicon size, and
ease of
interpretation. The backup markers are used if the first line markers at that chromosome arm are
uninformative or
otherwise ambiguous in their interpretation. LOH at all informative loci on each chromosomal arm
represents the
typical finding in oligodendrogliomas with 1 p and 19q deletion.

H and E slide was examined and tumor DNA was enriched by microdissection
Mutation of IDH1 occurs early in glioma progression with somatic mutations of the R132 residue of IDH1
identified in
majority (>70%) of grades II and III astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas, as well as in secondary GBMs
that
developed from these lower grade lesions. Mutation analysis of closely related IDH2 revealed mutations
of IDH2
residue R172, with most mutations occurring in tumors lacking IDH1 mutations. Tumors with IDH1 or
IDH2 mutations
have distinctive genetic and clinical characteristics, and patients with such tumors have a better outcome
than those
with wild type IDH genes.
Mutations in IDH1/2 are detected by DNA sequencing procedures. The limit of detection of standard
bidirectional
sequencing is approximately 20-25%. In order to increase assay sensitivity tumor enrichment must be
performed by
manual microdissection when tumor cells in the block constitute less than 50% of nucleated cells.
FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a stand alone diagnostic
test. This test
was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the,
as required by CLIA ""88 regulations. It has not been cleared or approved for specific uses by
the US Food
and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not
necessary. These

Comment: 
The proliferation index is within the expected range for an anaplastic 
oligodendroglioma.  reviewed selected slides and 
concurs with the presence of malignancy in this material. FISH 
analysis for the 1 p/19q deletion that is characteristic of many 
oligodendrogliomas is pending and when completed, a separate report 
will be issued. 
 
This diagnostic report has been personally interpreted by the signatory 
of record. 
Microscopic Description: 
Specimen #1 contains areas of classic oligodendroglioma but no 
anaplasia. Foci of anaplasia are present in specimen #2 (slides 2A and 
2B) and include a significantly elevated mitotic rate, microvascular 
proliferation, and necrosis. The findings are diagnostic of an 
anaplastic oligodendroglioma, grade Ill (WHO scale). 
Immunohistochemistry for the proliferation antigen Ki67 was performed 
as follows: three 250 x 250 micron fields were counted and the 
percentage of labeled nuclei determined. Over 1 000 cells were counted. 
  
The proliferation index ranged from 12.3% to 18% with an overall 
average of 1 6%.

INTERPRETATION: The results are less than the normal range and suggest 
deletions of 1 p and 19q in this anaplastic oligodendroglioma 
( del (1 p) and del(19q) has been observed in glioma 
specimens, especially oligodendrogliomas. Clinical and pathologic 
correlation is recommended. 
This diagnostic report has been personally interpreted by the signatory 
of record. 
 Data Analysis: 
DESCRIPTION OF THE ASSAY: 1 p and 19q FISH studies were performed on 
paraffin embedded tumor sections. Two hybridizations were performed: 
one with a 1 p/1 q probe/control pair and one with a 19q/19p 
probe/control pair. The 19q and 1 p probes map to regions that are 
commonly deleted in gliomas. The nuclei are counterstained with DAPI 
and the cells examined by epi-fluorescence microscopy. The total 
number of counts for each probe is determined in 200 cells and the 
ratios of 1 p/1 q and 19q/19p are calculated. 
Normal range: The normal ratio is approximately 1. Any ratio > 0.80 is 
considered normal. 
LIMITATIONS: Low levels of malignant cells in the specimen can result 
in a false negative result. As with all laboratory tests, sampling 
error and other factors may affect the outcome of the assay. 
Correlation of results with other clinical and laboratory data should 
be obtained. 
COMMENT: This test was developed and its performance characteristics 
determined by the Molecular Pathology Laboratory at  
. 
This test is not to be used as a diagnostic procedure without 
confirmation of the diagnosis by another medically established product 
or procedure.

Sections show a high-grade glioma demonstrating gemistocytic differentiation, high mitotic activity,
microvascular
proliferation and sheet (geographic) necrosis. The patient's tumor bank slides were also
reviewed.
IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY: There is diffuse moderate-to-strong reactivity for p53. The mitotic index by
MIB-1 is up
to approximately 45%. Positive and negative controls show appropriate immunoreactivity.
Results of any additional ancillary studies will be reported in procedure addenda below.

PCR for EGFR variant III mutation
Date Ordered : Date Reported:
Interpretation
NEGATIVE - No evidence of EGFRvIII mutation is detected
Surgical Pathology
Page 2 of 3
Results -Comments
TEST DESCRIPTION: Testing performed on RNA extracted from paraffin tissue block
H and E slide was examined and tumor DNA was enriched by microdissection
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an attractive molecular target in glioblastoma because it
is amplified,
overexpressed, and/or mutated in up to 40% to 50% of patients. Epidermal growth factor receptor variant
III
(EGFRvlll) is an oncogenic, constitutively active mutant form of EGFR that is commonly expressed in
glioblastoma. Cell culture and in vivo models of glioblastoma have demonstrated EGFRvIII as defining prognostically
distinct
subgroups of glioblastomas .Additionally ,the presence of EGFRvIII has been shown to sensitize tumors
to EGFR
tyrosine kinase inhibitors when the tumor suppressor protein PTEN is intact .RNA is extracted from
formalin fixed,
paraffin embedded tissue samples and reverse transcribed to cDNA .The cDNA is then amplified using
standard PCR
technique for DNA templates .PCR products are detected by gel electrophoresis .The limit of detection of
this assay
has been determined to be approximately 5 mutant cells in 100 normal cells.
FDA Comment :The above data are not to be construed as the results from a stand alone diagnostic test.
This test
was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the
as required
by CLIA ' 88 regulations .Ithas not been cleared or approved for specific uses by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA). The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These
results are
provided for informational purposes only, and should be interpreted only in the context of established
procedures

MGMT Promoter Methylation
Date Ordered: Date Reported:
Interpretation
POSITIVE: Methylated MGMT promoter is detected.
Results-Comments
Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor Neurosurgery sample
H and E slide was examined and no microdissection was needed.
TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT promoter have been shown to
benefit
from therapy with alkylating agents. Assessment of MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite
treatment of
DNA followed by real-time PCR amplification of methylated and unmethylated DNA
sequences. The
analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by serial dilution of methylated positive control DNA into
unmethylated DNA, and was assessed to be 1 % of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated
DNA. Factors
such as the presence of >50% non-neoplastic cells in the sample, or extensive tissue necrosis, may
preclude the
detection of methylated MGMT promoter sequences.
FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a stand alone diagnostic
test. This test
was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the
as required
by CLIA '88 regulations. It has not been cleared or approved for specific uses by the U.S. Food and Drug

SPECIMEN: 4, permanent tumor.
FIXATIVE: Saline.
GENERAL: A 3.0 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm., 1.9 gm. aggregate of several
fragments of red to gray-tan brain tissue.
SECTIONS: 7,8 - all.
MICROSCOPIC: A. Portions of cerebral cortex and adjacent white matter
diffusely infiltrated by a glial neoplastic proliferation. The
neoplastic cells have moderate nuclear pleomorphism with rounded and
elongated shapes. The neuropil is rarefied and contains numerous
reactive astrocytes. There are no areas of necrosis, microvascular
cellular proliferation, or mitoses.
B. Solid portion of tumor made of cells frequently exhibiting a
gemistocytic phenotype, with prominent nuclear pleomorphism, and nuclear features of anaplasia. Karyorrhexis is focally prominent, and
mitotic figures are rather frequent. The neoplastic nuclei have a
tendency for a round outline, and the vasculature is capillary-type
with interanastomosing vessels.
C. Portions of gray and white matter with diffuse infiltration by a
glial neoplasm with rarefaction of the neuropil. The neoplastic
cells are small and irregular with a moderate degree of pleomorphism.
Mitoses, microvascular cellular proliferation, and necrosis are absent.
D. Portions of cerebral cortex and white matter diffusely infiltrated
by a glial neoplastic proliferation of moderate cellularity and nuclear
atypia. The nuclei are round and elongated. Focally, the tumor is
more cellular, and the tumor cells are surrounded by perinuclear halos;
the background is finely fibrillary and has fine capillary type
vessels, minigemistocytes and true gemistocytes. However, areas of
necrosis, mitotic figures or necrosis are absent.
SPECIAL STAINS: Immunoperoxidase methods for GFAP and MIB-l were
performed on blocks #1 and 5, and for CD34 (a vascular marker) on block
#1. The GFAP brings up the astrocytic nature of the tumor cells. The
CD34 highlights the microvasculature. With the MIB-1 labelling indices
of 2% in specimen A and 8% in specimen B are determined.
COMMENT: The lesion is a neoplastic proliferation of glial cells that
in the superficial specimen (A) has the appearance of an astrocytoma
(grade II) with a MIB-1 labelling index of less than 1%. In the deeper
specimen (B), the tumor has features of anaplasia (grade III) with a
gemistocytic phenotype and a MIB-1 index of 8%. The tumor is present
in the deep margin (C). In the fourth specimen (D) the histology is
intermediate between A and B, and there is suggestion of an
oligodendroglial component.

Microscopic  Discussion:  
 Sections demonstrate a moderately hypercelllar glial neoplasm, the cells of which primari ly 
resemble fibrillary astrocyt es.  A small but definite oligodendroglioma component is also seen.  
The tumor diffusely infiltrates gray and white matter.  No microvascular proliferation or necrosis are present.  No mitotic figures are seen.  Atypia is generally mild.  Scattered moderately atypical cells are present.  
. Addendum D iscussion : 
 Scattered MIB -1 reactive cells are present.  In the most proliferative areas, a labeling index of 
6.1% is calculated.  This is indicative of an intermediate level of proliferation and a level that can be seen in either low or anaplastic tumors.  The overall histologic features are indicative of a low grade tumor.  However, close follow up is indicated.

A and B. Brain, left temporal, excision: Glioblastoma. 
See Comment. 
COMMENT 
Both specimens contain glioblastoma. The neoplasm has numerous giant cells, 
mitotic activity, focal necrosis, and prominent microvascular cellular 
proliferation that focally has a sarcomatoid pattern.

determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These results are 
provided for informational purposes only, and should be interpreted only in 
the context of established procedures and/or diagnostic criteria. 
Interpretation 
Brain, Immunohistochemistry: MIB-l proliferation index 11%. 
See Results and Comment (below). 
Results-Comments 
IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY: The GFAP demonstrates glial fibrillogenesis by the 
neoplastic cells. The synaptophysin and NeuN depict neurons in the zone where 
the neoplasm infiltrates cerebral cortex. The NFP is negative. The CD34 
denotes small vessels with microvascular cellular proliferation. With the 
MIB-l there is a proliferation index of about 11% in the more active areas. 
The sarcomatoid areas are GFAP negative and virtually devoid of vessels. 
SPECIAL STAIN: The Snook's reticulum demonstrates absent reticulin within the 
sarcomatoid areas. 
Comment: These results are consistent with a high histological grade 
astrocytic tumor, without a neuronal component, i.e. a glioblastoma. The 
focal histological sarcomatoid areas appear to be a newl undifferentiated 
clone of non-sarcomatous neoplastic cells. .

TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT promoter 
have been shown to benefit from therapy Ivith alkylating agents. Assessment of 
MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite treatment of DNA followed 
by real-time PCR amplification (MethyLight) of methylated and unmethylated DNA

Interpretation 
NEGATIVE -No evidence of EGFRvIII mutation is detected 
,sui ts-Comments 
TRST oRRrRTPTToN: Testing performed on RNA extracted from tumor paraffin block 
RNA quality: Good 
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an attractive molecular target 
in glioblastoma because it is amplified, overexpressedl and/or mutated in up 
to 40% to 50% of patients. Epidermal growth factor receptor variant III 
(EGFRvIII) is an oncogenic, constitutively active mutant form of EGFR that is 
commonly expressed in glioblastoma. Cell culture and in vivo models of 
glioblastoma have demonstrated EGFRvIII as defining prognostically distinct 
subgroups of glioblastomas. Additionally, the presence of EGFRvIII has been 
shown to sensitize tumors to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors when the tumor 
suppressor protein PTEN is intact. RNA is extracted from formalin fixed, 
paraffin embedded tissue samples and reverse transcribed to cDNA. The cDNA is 
then amplified using standard PCR technique for DNA templates. PCR products 
are detected by gel electrophoresis. The limit of detection of this assay has 
been determined to be approximately 5 mutant cells in 100 normal cells.

CLINICAL HISTORY 
of 
with normal On 1'ma.gl.n, 
a temporal lobe, The lesion has a 
broad leptomeningeal base the lateral wall of the middle cranial 
fossa, and solid areas of enhancement with septation. The lesion also has 
chronic hemorrhage products, and absence of vasogenic edema or mass effect. 
OPERATIVE DIAGNOSES 
Left temporal lesion 
Op \tion/Specimen: A: Brain,left temporal tumor, biopsy 
B: ~ainf left temporal tumor, biopsy 
PATHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS: 
A, B. Brain, left temporal tumor, excision: Astrocytic neoplasm with 
anaplastic features. 
See Microscopy Description and Comment. 
COMMENT 
The neoplasm is a superficial pleomorphic glial neoplasm that is in close 
contact with the leptomeninges. The bulk of the tumor has mostly 
oligo-like/astrocytic and spindle/fascicular growth components. There are 
also a few focal areas that are densely epithelioid and have a sarcomatoid 
appearance. The oligoastrocytic and spindle cell components of the tumor 
appear to be low histological grade. The solid epithelioid component, 
however, has readily found mitotic figures and a high MIB-l proliferation 
index of up to 25%. There is prominent hemosiderosis and some micro 
mineralization focally. 
The findings may possibly be interpreted as those of a superficial, 
pleomorphic glial neoplasm with morphological features of a pleomorphic 
xanthoastrocytoma that has focal zones of anaplastic transformation. A 
superficial glioblastoma is an important differential diagnosis. 
The case is being sent for an outside opinion.

have been shown to benefit from therapy with alkylating agents. Assessment of 
MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite treatment of DNA followed 
by real-time PCR amplification (MethyLight) of methylated and unmethylated DNA 
sequences.

Results-Comments 
Test peformed on DNA extracted from paraffin block 
peripheral blood for germline comparison. and 
TE8T DE8CRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA 
(baseline)/ Tumor DNA pairs using 3 markers at both 1p and 19q. The 3 markers 
on 1p are D18548, D181592, and D18552 (with D18468, D181612, and D18496 as 
backup markers) and the 3 markers on 19q are D198219, D198412, and PLA2G4C 
(with D198606 and D1981182 as backup). All markers are microsatellites (2 or 4 
nt repeats) except PLA2G4C which is a minisatellite (26 nt repeat) 
polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score, 
amplicon size, and ease of interpretation. The backup markers are used if the 
first line markers at that chromosome arm are uninformative or otherwise 
ambiguous in their interpretation. LOH at all informative loci on each 
chromosomal arm represents the typical finding in oligodendrogliomas with 1p

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION 
H and IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY: 
neoplasm. The lesion is a pleomorphic glial 
There are glial areas with oligodendroglioma-like and astrocytoma phenotypes. 
These areas appear as low histological grade. There are also extensive areas 
that have a spindle cell/fascicular growth morphology, in some of which the 
cytoplasm appears vacuolar (""xanthomatous""). Furthermore, there are fragments 
that have epithelioid, plump cell morphology with nuclear pleomorphism. There 
is transition between the three different patterns. Microvascular 
proliferation and necrosis are rather inconspicuous. 
The GFAP demonstrates that in all three different areas there is an 
appreciable population of gliofibrillary-positive cells. The  
reticulum demonstrates that throughout the tumor and in between the neoplastic 
glial cells there is a rich intercellular reticulin network, which is' 
particularly prominent in the spindle cell and epithelioid areas. , 
Tli .euronal markers (NeuN and synaptophysin) highlight portions of cerebral 
cortex and native neurons entrapped by neoplastic tissue; there does not 
Requested by: Page 3 
 Mitotic figures are inconspicuous in the glial and spindle/fascicular zones of 
t,l neoplasm, where the MIB-l proliferation indices are very 1m-, overall. 
Hl .ver, in a couple of areas of compact epithelioid pattern, mitotic figures 
can be identified without difficulty and the MIB-l proliferation index is 
high, about 25% (AI and A7) . 
The neoplasm is superficial, focally in contact with the pia, and has 
multifocal collections of lymphocytes. Throughout the tumor there are 
abundant deposits of hemosiderin. This hemosiderosis is readily identified in 
xanthomatous areas. There are also focal areas of micro mineralization. On 
the smears there is prominent microvascular proliferation with frequent 
formation of glomeruloid structures.

Comment 
I TCGA-06-1806 
Page 5 "," Based on the pathology report provided, the tumor can be described as follows:

- Site: The tumor is a left cerebral cortex neoplasm, based on the location of the resected tissue.
- Laterality: The tumor is located in the left hemisphere of the brain, as indicated by ""left oral"" in the ICD-9 code provided.
- Histology: The tumor is a glial neoplasm with areas showing oligodendroglioma-like and astrocytoma phenotypes, as well as spindle cell/fascicular growth morphology and epithelioid, plump cell morphology. The presence of a rich reticulin network and GFAP-positive cells support the glial origin of the tumor.
- Stage: The stage cannot be determined from the information provided.
- Grade: The tumor appears to be low grade based on the histological features, but there are areas with high mitotic activity and MIB-1 proliferation index, which suggest a higher grade.
- Behavior: The tumor is malignant, as indicated by its invasive growth and the presence of microvascular proliferation and hemosiderosis.

Justification for the choice: The site and laterality are directly mentioned in the report. The histology is based on the description of the tumor's features, including the glial markers and reticulin network. The stage cannot be determined, but the grade is estimated based on the low-grade features with focal high-grade areas. The behavior is malignant based on the invasive growth pattern and other features suggestive of malignancy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GROSS PATHOLOGY: Specimen 1, received in fresh state and labeled with
the patient's name for frozen section, consists of two small fragments
o,an, hemorrhagic, glassy friable soft tissue measuring 0.2 and 0.15
c^',,across respectively. Smears and frozen sections are obtained.
Tissue utilized for frozen sections submitted in cassette 1, remaining
tissue submitted totally in cassette 2. Frozen section diagnosis:
Brain, right frontoparietal, biopsy: high grade glioma.
Specimen 2, right frontoparietal, received in fresh state for permanent
sections and labeled with the patient's name, consists of a somewhat
rounded and 2.8 cm. in largest diameter mass of semifirm tissue. The
external surface of the mass is irregular, focally hemorrhagic and
about half of its surface appears brown and necrotic. On serial
section, the mass exhibits a central area of brown soft necrotic tissue
surrounded by a more homogeneous yellowish area, and a more peripheral
rim of grayish-white, glistening and somewhat granular homogeneous
tissue. About 2/3 of the specimen are submitted for paraffin embedding
in cassettes 3 thru 5.
MICROSCOPIC: All the microscopic slides contain portions of a
neoplastic astrocytic proliferation with a marked degree of nuclear and
cellular anaplasia, focally high mitotic rate, very prominent
endothelial/vascular proliferation, and extensive areas of necrosis.
The neoplasm is diffusely infiltrating the cerebral cortex and focally
extends into the leptomeningeal space.
COMMENT: The lesion is a very characteristic glioblastoma multiforme
with a central area of necrosis surrounded by a ring-shaped portion of
neoplastic tissue with prominent endothelial vascular proliferation.
The tumor is focally growing into the leptomeningeal space. An MIB-1
immunoperoxidase stain for proliferation indexing is requested and
f1'-z her report will follow.

Operation/Specimen: A: Brain, excision biopsy 
B: Brain, excision biopsy 
PATHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS: 
A. B. Brain, left parietal, excision: 
1. Malignant astrocytic tumor, with rhabdoid features and leptomeningeal 
infiltration. 
2. MIB-l proliferation index: 9%. 
See Microscopy Description and Comment. 
COMMENT 
The tumor is a neoplastic proliferation of glial cells that have focal areas 
with a spindle cell astrocytic phenotype, and extensive areas where the tumor 
cells have an epithelioid-rhabdoid/pseudorhabdoid morphology. The tumor""has 
prominent mitotic activity and a proliferation index of about 9%. There is 
focally prominent neovascularization with endothelial hyperplasia, and there is tumor necrosis associated with hemorrhage. The neoplasm is growing 
extensively in the leptomeninges. There are not mesenchymal, epithelial, or 
undifferentiated neuroectodermal cell components. 
The neoplasm is interpreted as high histological grade astrocytic neoplasm 
(WHO grade IV) that has a rhabdoid/pseudorhabdoid component. The absence of 
epithelial, stromal, or primitive neuroectodermal cell components is against 
the possibility of the tumor being an atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor of the 
cerebrum. Rhabdoid phenotype has been reported with classical glioblastoma 
(WHO grade IV neoplasm) . -06-2566

Results-Comments 
TEST DR~CRIPTION: Testing performed on RNA extracted from paraffin tissue 
block 
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an attractive molecular target 
in glioblastoma because it is amplified, overexpressed, and/or mutated in up 
to 40% to 50% of patients. Epidermal growth factor receptor variant III 
(EGFRvIII) is an oncogenic, constitutively active mutant form of EGFR that is 
commonly expressed in glioblastoma. Cell culture and in vivo models of 
glioblastoma have demonstrated EGFRvIII as defining prognostically distinct 
subgroups of glioblastomas. Additionally, the presence of EGFRvIII has been 
shown to sensitize tumors to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors when the tumor 
suppressor protein PTEN is intact. RNA is extracted from formalin fixed, 
paraffin embedded tissue samples and reverse transcribed to cDNA. The cDNA is 
then amplified using standard PCR technique for DNA templates. PCR products 
are detected by gel electrophoresis. The limit of detection of this assay has 
been determined to be approximately 5 mutant cells in 100 normal cells.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION 
IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY: The GFAP demonstrates heavy gliofibrillogenesis in the 
spindle cell areas of the neoplasm. Where the tumor is growing in the 
leptomeninges there is no appreciable gliofibrillogenesis. In the 
epithelioid/rhabdoid-pseudorhabdoid areas there is rather sparse 
gliofibrillogenesis. 
The tumor cells throughout are strongly immunoreactive with vimentin, and 
moderately positive with S100. The epithelioid/rhabdoid-pseudorhabdoid cells 
are strongly positive with vimentin, and only sparsely and focally with GFAP, 
but without formation of spherical cytoplasmic inclusions. While the spindled 
neoplastic cells have fine dusting positivity with the mitochondrial antibody, 
the epithelioid cells are very densely packed by positive granules (oncocytic 
change). The neoplastic cells are negative with the SMA. The CD 99 is 
sitive (as may be seen in glioblastomas also). 
The neoplastic cells are not reactive with cytokeratin, CK7, EMA, HMB-45, 
MelanA, NeuN, and synaptophysin. A great majority of tumor cells strongly 
Page 3 
 over express the p53 protein. With the MIB-l there is a proliferation index 
of about 9% in the more active areas. 
SPECIAL STAIN: The Snook's reticulum demonstrates 
where the neoplasm is invading the leptomeninges. 
growth is prominent in perivascular areas only.

are associated with a significantly decreased five -year survival rate  
compared to those with proliferation indices of  less than 5%.   The  
different survival rates are, respectively, 83% versus 24% (1).   FISH  
for the 1p/19q deletion has been ordered and when completed, a separate

   Data Analysis:  
DESCRIPTION OF THE ASSAY: 1p and 19q FISH studies were performed on  
paraffin embedded tumor sections. Two hybridizations were performed:  
one with a 1p/1q probe/control pair and one with a 19q/19p  
probe/control pair.  The 19q and 1p probes map to regions that are  
commonly deleted in gliomas.  The nuclei are counterstained with DAPI  
and the cells examin ed by epi -fluorescence microscopy.  The total  
number of counts for each probe is determined in 200 cells and the  
ratios of 1p/1q and 19q/19p are calculated.  
  
Normal range: The normal ratio is approximately 1. Any ratio > 0.80 is  
considered normal.  
  LIMITATIONS: Low levels of malignant cells in the specimen can result  
in a false negative result. As with all laboratory tests, sampling  
error and other factors may affect the outcome of the assay.  
Correlation of results with other clinical and laboratory data should  
be obtained.  
  
COMMENT: This test was developed and its performance characteristics  
determined by the Molecular Pathology Laboratory at 
. It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S.  
Food and Drug Administration.  
This test is not to be used as a diagnostic procedure without  
confirmation of the diagnosis by another medically established product  
or procedure.

Justification: The clinical history and diagnosis provided indicate that the specimens are from a right temporal lobe oligodendroglioma, which has been graded as grade II. The site and laterality are mentioned in the source of the specimen section. The stage is not provided, as it is not typically assigned to brain tumors, and behavior is also not provided since it's not relevant for brain tumors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

icroscopic  
 Sections demonstrate a glial neoplasm that diffusely infiltrates both gray and white matter.  The tumor cells consistently have intermediate- sized round nuclei 
and variably prominent, classic perinuclear halos.  Microcystic  myxoid change is 
seen in some regions but most of the tumor is solid. There is extensive infiltration but in many areas confluent hypercellularity is seen.  Atypia is moderate.  Despite this, mitotic figures are rare with only three seen in more than 100 high power fields.  Both the frozen section and slides also demonstrate focal microvascular proliferation but this is not a widespread feature.  
 MIB-1 immunohistochemistry is performed on blocks.  In the preponderant areas 
of tumor that lack significant nu mbers of mitoses, MIB -1 immunoreactivity is 
highly variable on a regional basis.  The majority of areas demonstrates a labeling index of <1%.  A significant minority show greater proliferative activity with a labeling index of up to 8.6%.  In the regions with greater atypia and mitotic activity, a labeling index of 8.85 is seen diffuse.  Overall, these findings are consistent with the diagnosis of anaplastic oligodendroglioma but suggests that this present in a background of low grade oligodendroglioma.  
   Final Diagnosis:  
 Right parietal brain tumor biopsy and resection:  
Consistent with anaplastic oligodendroglioma in predominant background of low grade oligodendroglioma  
MIB-1 labeling index = <1% - 8.8%  
"," 1. ""Site"": Brain. Justified as the report clearly states the tumor is a right parietal brain tumor.

Surgical Pathology
Page 2 of 4
TEST DESCRIPTION: Testing performed on RNA extracted from paraffin tissue block (A3)
H and E slide was examined and no microdissection was needed.
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an attractive molecular target in glioblastoma because it
is amplified,
overexpressed, and/or mutated in up to 40% to 50% of patients. Epidermal growth factor receptor variant
III
(EGFRvIII) is an oncogenic, constitutively active mutant form of EGFR that is commonly expressed in
glioblastoma.
Cell culture and in vivo models of glioblastoma have demonstrated EGFRvIII as defining prognostically
distinct
subgroups of glioblastomas. Additionally, the presence of EGFRvIII has been shown to sensitize tumors
to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors when the tumor suppressor protein PTEN is intact .RNA is extracted from
formalin fixed,
paraffin embedded tissue samples and reverse transcribed to cDNA .The cDNA is then amplified using
standard PCR
technique for DNA templates .PCR products are detected by gel electrophoresis .The limit of detection of
this assay
has been determined to be approximately 5 mutant cells in 100 normal cells.
FDA Comment :The above data are not to be construed as the results from a stand alone diagnostic test.
This test

MGMT Promoter Methylation
Date Ordered : Date Reported:
Interpretation
NEGATIVE: No evidence of methylated MGMT promoter is detected.
Results -Comments
Testing performed on DNA extracted from paraffin tissue block (A3)
H and E slide was examined and no microdissection was needed.
TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT promoter have been shown to
benefit
from therapy with alkylating agents .Assessment of MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfate
treatment of
DNA followed by real -time PCR amplification of methylated and unmethylated DNA
sequences. The
analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by serial dilution of methylated positive control DNA into
unmethylated DNA, and was assessed to be I% of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated
DNA. Factors
such as the presence of >50 %non-neoplastic cells in the sample ,or extensive tissue necrosis, may
preclude the
detection of methylated MGMT promoter sequences.
FDA COMMENT :The above data are not to be construed as the results from a stand alone diagnostic

Loss of Heterozygosity I p, 19q Assay (LOH)
Date Ordered: Date Reported:
Interpretation
POSITIVE: Allelic loss on chromosome arm 19q is detected. Allelic loss on chromosome arm 1 p is not detected
Informative loci are: D1S548, D1S1592, D19S412, D19S606, D19S1182
Results -Comments
Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block (A3). DNA extracted from a
corresponding blood specimen was used as a normal reference control.
H and E slide was examined and no microdissection was needed.
TEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA ( baseline )! Tumor DNA
pairs using 3
markers at both 1 p and 19q. The 3 markers on 1 p are D1 S548, D1 S1592, and D1 S552 (with D1 S468,
D1S1612, and
D1 S496 as backup markers) and the 3 markers on 19q are D19S219, D19S412, and PLA2G4C (with
D19S606 and
D19S1182 as backup). All markers are microsatellites (2 or 4 nt repeats) except PLA2G4C which is a
minisatellite (26
nt repeat) polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score, amplicon size, and
ease of
interpretation. The backup markers are used if the first line markers at that chromosome arm are
uninformative or
otherwise ambiguous in their interpretation. LOH at all informative loci on each chromosomal arm
represents the
typical finding in oligodendrogliomas with 1 p and 19q deletion.
FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a stand-alone diagnostic
test. This test
was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the
as required
by CUA ' 88 regulations. It has not been cleared or approved for specific uses by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA). The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These
results are
provided for informational purposes only, and should be interpreted only in the context of established
procedures
and/or diagnostic criteria.
TECHNICAL SENSITIVITY: The presence of >15% non-neoplastic cells in the sample may preclude the
detection of
allelic loss.

TECHNICAL SENSITIVITY: The presence of >15% non-neoplastic cells in the
sample
may preclude the detection of allelic loss.
PRINCIPLE: Among the major subtypes of gliomas, oligodendrogliomas are
distinguished by their remarkable sensitivity to chemotherapy, with
approximately 70% of anaplastic (malignant) oligodendrogliomas responding
dramatically to treatment with procarbazine, lomustine, and vincristine
(termed PCV) (Cairncross et al, 1998). Unfortunately, no clinical or
pathologic feature allows accurate prediction of chemotherapeutic response.
Oligodendrogliomas are also associated with a longer average patient survival as compared to astrocytic tumors. However, the histologic distinction between
oligodendroglioma and astrocytoma is often highly subjective, and there has
been significant interobserver variation.
Studies (Cairncross et al, 1998; Ino et al, 2001; Smith et al, 2000) have
shown that:
- allelic loss (loss of heterozygosity) of chromosome arm lp is a
statistically significant and currently the best predictor of
chemosensitivity
- combined loss involving chromosome arms 1p and 19q predicts both
chemotherapeutic response and longer survival in patients with
oligodendrogliomas
-combined allelic loss of chromosomes lp and 19q can be considered a
molecular signature of oligodendroglioma (present in approximately 70-80% of
oligodendroglial tumors and in only 10% of astrocytomas)

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
H\T\E: There is a neoplastic proliferation of oligodendrocytes that has some
""proliferation centers"", and infiltrates the brain sparsely or moderately.
There are only occasional mitotic figures, more readily observed in the
proliferation centers, where there is also neovascularization. There is no
microvascular cellular proliferation. There is no necrosis. In part C, in
addition to focal neoplasm, there is rarefaction and prominent reactive
astrocytosis with Rosenthal fibers.
IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY: The GFAP demonstrates absent or sparse gliofibrillarity
by the neoplastic cells. The tumor cells do not over express the p53 protein.
Synaptophysin and NeuN demonstrate the proclivity of the neoplasm for the
cerebral cortex, and absence of positive reaction in the neoplastic cells.
The CD34 depicts the neovascularization within the tumor. With the MIB1, the
overall proliferation index is about 2%, and in the proliferation centers it
may be up to about 4%.
In the rarefied, gliotic areas of specimen C thereare no neuronal elements,
neoplastic astrocytes, or diffuse reactivity withCD34.
SPECIAL STAIN: The PAS with/without diastase failsto demonstrate granular
bodies.

Operation/Specimen: Brain, left temporal lobe.
Clinical History and Pre-Op Dx: Four week history of sudden appearance
of dysphasia in a patient who has no history of systemic illness or
systemic neoplasia. She has not had previous surgery. Neuro-imaging
studies revealed an enhancing mass in the left temporal area, attached
to the dura, which is interpreted as ""meningioma"".
GROSS PATHOLOGY: Specimen received in two separate containers labeled
with the patient's MRN and name. They both contain small fragments of
sr'gelatinous grayish-red tissue in which normal landmarks of brain
ax:tecture cannot be recognized. The largest one of this fragment
measures approximately 2.5 x.0.7 x 0.5 cm in greatest dimensions. The
entire specimen is submitted in 7 tissue cassettes.
INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION:
1.Necrotizing tissue, no clear cut evidence of neoplasia.
2.Small cell, necrotizing neoplasm by
MICROSCOPIC: Fragments of brain parenchyma can be recognized in some
of the sections. However, the tissue is almost completely effaced by
diffuse infiltration of a neoplasm made-up of small cells that lack a
clear cut architectural pattern, but occasionally are arranged in
rosette-like structures. A prominent feature of this neoplasm are the
numerous blood vessels, small medium-sized and large, many of which are
thrombosed. Hemorrhage and coagulation necrosis are important
components of this neoplasm that lacks almost entirely collagen fiber
deposition. Individual neoplastic cells are approximately 8 to 10
micros in diameter, have a relatively large nucleus and very scanty
cytoplasm without prominent processes. Atypical mitosis, individual
cell necrosis, and nuclear pleomorphism are all easily appreciated in
almost every field of this neoplasm. Intermingled with the numerous
undifferentiated small cells, there are large adult astrocytes and
occasional neurons that do not seem to be components of the neoplasm.

CC:.,NT: By any criteria, these neoplastic cells are classified as
being highly undifferentiated. The tumor displays many features
considered undesirable such as frequent mitosis, necrosis and evidence
of angiogenic stimuli. The diffuse infiltrative pattern suggests a
neoplasm derived from neuroectodermal elements. A follow-up report
will be issued as soon as the following immunohistochemical reactions
are ready: GFAP, LCA, Keratin, Synaptophysin, and MIB-l.

BILLING CODES
ADDENDUM
Immunoperoxidase stains for leukocyte common antigen, glial fibrillary
acidic protein, keratin cocktail, and MIB-1 were performed on block #4.
great majority of neoplastic cells are not reactive with GFAP. The
reactivity, when present, is weak and sparse. Star-shaped reactive
astrocytes display strong immunoreactivity with GFAP. The tumor cells
show no reactivity with LCA or keratins. With the MIB-1, the tumor
has a very high labelling index of about 60%.
COMMENT: The immunoperoxidase stains confirm the undifferentiated
nature of this glial neoplasm, namely a glioblastoma multiforme of the
small cell variant. The tumor has a very high labelling index of about
60%.

icroscopic  
 
Microscopic examination reveals a moderately cellular glial neoplasm.  The tumor is composed of cells with both astrocytic and oligodendroglial features.  The oligodendroglial component  exhibits a proliferation  of cells with  round to 
oval, moderately  pleomorphic nuclei  with prominent preinuclear halos.  
Scattered microgemistocytes are identified, as well.  The minor astroc ytic 
component consists of neoplastic cells with oval to elongate nuclei and moderate cytologic atypia.  Overall, only a rare mitotic figure is seen; however, mitoses are 
focally elevated at up to 3 mitoses per 10 high power fields.  Neither necrosis nor microvasculascular proliferation are identified.  The neoplastic  cells are identified 
infiltrat ing the adjacent brain parenchyma.  The histologic features are consistent 
with an oligoastrocytoma.  A final diagnosis will be issued pending review of MIB -
1 labeling index.  
 Addendum  
 A MIB -1 labeling index was performed on three blocks of tissue.  Overall, the 
MIB-1 labeling index is low at 2.4- 3.7%; however, a focal region of tumor 
demonstrates increased proliferative activity at 6.2%.  The focally elevated MIB -1 
labeling index, in conjunction with focally increased mitotic activity at 3 mitoses per 10 high power  fields, are suggestive of very early anaplastic progression in 
an otherwise low grade glioma.

 The neoplastic cells are consistently immunoreactive for p53 indicative                 
 astrocytic origin.  Scattered MIB -1 reactive cells are p resent.  In the                 
 majority of the specimen, a labeling index of 3.6% is calculated.  However,             
 there is one focus with higher proliferative activity and a labeling index of           
 7.1%.  Whereas this higher value merits close  follow -up, a classification of            
 anaplastic is not warranted.

Performed by: 
30f3 "," Site: Brain tissue (Craniectomy) - This is mentioned in the given report where the high-grade astrocytoma and glioblastoma were diagnosed.

Laterality: Not provided - The report does not mention any information regarding the laterality of the tumor.

Histology: High-grade astrocytoma and glioblastoma - This is explicitly mentioned in the given report as the primary diagnosis.

Stage: Not applicable - The report does not provide information on the stage, which is typically used for cancers with known routes of metastasis. Brain tumors like high-grade astrocytomas and glioblastomas are usually described by their grade instead of stage.

Grade: High grade (WHO Grade IV) - The report mentions that the tumor was diagnosed as a glioblastoma, which is a WHO Grade IV brain tumor. Additionally, it indicates high-grade astrocytoma, which also falls under WHO Grade III or IV.

Behavior: Poor prognosis - Given that the tumors are high grade (WHO Grade III or IV) and have multiple abnormal markers, the behavior of these tumors is likely to be aggressive with a poor prognosis.

CLINICAL:
Grade 11 insular glioma,
MACROSCOPIC:
A. Specimen labelled ""1 brain tumour"",consists of multiple pieces of light grey to tanglial tissue ranging in size between 3-16mm, with an aggregate measurement of 40 x25 x 6mm. AE 2 blocks.
B.Specimen labelled ""2 most aggressive tumour"", consists of a 2 x1 x1 mm fragmentof tan tissue .AE 1 block.
MICROSCOPIC:
A, B. All tissue pieces are extensively infiltrated by a glioma. The cellularity varies
from moderate in the sample labelled ""1brain tumour "",to more cellular in the 2ndspecimen labelled ""2 most aggressive tumour"". Moderate cellular pleomorphism isnoted ,which is perhaps more prominent in specimen 1.Only very rare mitoticfigures are identified in the ""1 brain tumour"" and there are no mitotic figures in ""2most aggressive tumour "".There is no necrosis. or perivascular proliferation.
fmmunoperoxidase stains:
Ki-67 (proliferative index ):iswell under 1% in both specimens.
Despite the finding of very rare mitotic figures, the overall features are considered to
be within the spectrum of a diffuse astrocytoma (WHO grade 2).

Comment
This diffuse astrocytoma has readily identifiable mitoses, consistent with anaplastic astrocytoma, WHO
grade 3.
Abnormal blood vessels and karyorrhectic nuclei are also identified. However, there is no definite
microvascular
proliferation and no foci of tumor necrosis.
Pre-operative radiology imaging studies report nodular areas of contrast-enhancement in the periphery of
this
neoplasm. The possibility of these biopsies representing peripheral regions of a glioblastoma cannot be
excluded.
The histological findings may be correlated with clinical and radiology imaging features for the final
clinicopathological
interpretation.

Loss of Heterozygosity 1 p, 19q Assay (LOH)
Date Ordered : Date Reported:
Interpretation
NEGATIVE: Allelic loss on chromosome arm 1p and chromosome arm 19q is NOT detected.
Informative loci are: D1 S552, D1 S468, D1 S1612, D1 S496, D19S219, D19S606 and D19S1182
Results -Comments Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block (A2). DNA extracted
from a
corresponding blood specimen was used as a normal reference control.
H and E slide was examined and no microdissection was needed.
TEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA (baseline)/ Tumor DNA
pairs using 3
markers at both 1 p and 19q. The 3 markers on 1 p are D1 S548, D1 S1592, and D1 S552 (with D1 S468,
D1 S1612, and
D1 S496 as backup markers )and the 3 markers on 19q are D19S219, D19S412, and PLA2G4C (with
D19S606 and
Dl9S1182 as backup ).Allmarkers are microsatellites (2 or 4 nt repeats) except PLA2G4C which is a
minisatellite (26
nt repeat )polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score ,amplicon size, and
ease of
interpretation. The backup markers are used if the first line markers at that chromosome arm are
uninformative or
otherwise ambiguous in their interpretation . LOH at all informative loci on each chromosomal arm
represents the
typical finding in oligodendrogliomas with 1 p and 19q deletion.
FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a stand -alone diagnostic
test. This test
was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the
as required
by CLIA '88 regulations .Ithas not been cleared or approved for specific uses by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA). The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These
results are
provided for informational purposes only, and should be interpreted only in the context of established
procedures
and/or diagnostic criteria.
TECHNICAL SENSITIVITY: The presence of >15% non -neoplastic cells in the sample may preclude the
detection of
allelic loss.

Macroscopy:
Received five irregular structures of the brain ,the largest measuring 5.5 x 4 .0 x 2.0 cm,
partially covered by meninge and presenting on the outer surface a jelly, brown and
irregular lesion .Smaller structures together measure 3.0 x 2.5 x 0.5 cm.
Microscopy:
Histological sections stained with H & E sections show diffuse glial neoplasm with
moderate and polymorphic cellularity, consisting sometimes of cells with clear
cytoplasm that exhibit perinuclear halo, sometimes by cells with elongated nuclei, dense
chromatin and eosinophilic cytoplasm .The nuclei show moderate pleomorphism.
Examination shows multiple cells with minigemistocistic aspect and sattelitosis of
neoplastic cells in cortical neurons .A few areas of the neoplasm presents with dense
cellularity ,with sparse mitotic figures and steeper nuclear atypia ,but no foci of
microvascular proliferation .In these areas the CPI Ki- 67 is about 5 %.Itisalso
observed ,focal deposits of hemosiderin .Not observed foci of necrosis in the tumor. In
areas of astrocytic pattern, there is overexpression of p53. The tumor shows
predominant oligodendroglial pattern.
Diagnosis:
Resection product of brain lesion :Oligoastrocitoma with diffuse anaplastic foci, WHO
grade II (ICD-O 9382/3)
Notes:
There are no criteria for grade III, although the greater CPI Ki-67 in some areas
associated with nuclear atypia are highly suggestive of malignancy progression to
higher degree of malignancy.

Calculated lp/lq ratio = 0.50 (< 0.74 is deleted)
Calculated 19q/19p ratio = 0.56 (< 0.88 is deleted)
The results are interpreted as deleted for lp and 19q. The results are interpreted
as deleted for Sp and 19q. This assay was read by
A result of a deleted lp and 19q suggests a favorable prognosis.

Sections demonstrate a moderately cellular proliferation of neoplastic astrocytes, primarily with gemistocytic features.  Pleomorphism is prominent in areas.  Focal areas of neoplastic oligodendrocytes are also present. There is no evidence of microvascular proliferation.  Mitotic figures are ot seen.  However, several large foci of necrosis without psudopalisading are present.  
 Addendum  
MIB-1 stain demonstrates scattered reactive cells.  It also identifies a rare mitotic 
figure.  The MIB -1  labeling index of 2.2% is indicative of a modestly proliferative 
tumor.  
 Diagnosis  
 Oliogoastrocytoma, astrocytoma predominant,  grade II  
"," 1. ""Site"": Brain - Justified as the report clearly states that the tumor is an oligoastrocytoma, which typically occurs in the brain.
2. ""Laterality"": Not provided - The report does not specify whether the tumor is located in the left or right hemisphere of the brain.
3. ""Histology"": Oligoastrocytoma, astrocytoma predominant - As stated in the diagnosis, this is a tumor with features of both oligodendroglioma and astrocytoma, but primarily exhibiting astrocytic characteristics.
4. ""Stage"": Not provided - The TNM system is typically not used for brain tumors. Instead, they are often classified by grade, as seen below.
5. ""Grade"": II - Justified by the diagnosis of ""oligoastrocytoma, astrocytoma predominant, grade II."" This grade indicates a low to intermediate grade or moderately differentiated tumor.
6. ""Behavior"": Not applicable - Brain tumors, unlike many other cancers, do not typically invade surrounding tissues or metastasize, so the concept of behavior is not usually applied.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MICROSCOPIC: A,B and C. All sections reveal a high grade anaplastic 
glial tumor. The neoplasm is of high cellularity and is composed of 
cells that range in differentiation, from small anaplastic cells 
without discerniable cytoplasm to large and pleomorphic multinucleated 
neoplastic cells. Throughout the tumor there is pronounced nuclear 
pleomorphism and very brisk mitotic activity. In some of the sections, 
the neoplastic cells display a vaguely lobular pattern with indistinct 
clear cytoplasmic halos which may represent differentiation towards 
oligodendroglioma. The tumor infiltrates diffusely the cerebral cortex 
and there is evidence of old hemorrhage with macrophages and tumor 
cells containing hemosiderin in their cytoplasm. There is moderate to 
of stromal vessels and small

The tumor is composed of sheets of cells with round nuclei.  In areas  
of the tumor specimen, many tumor cells have perinuclear halos.  The  
tumor cells infiltrate cerebral grey matter.  While mitotic figures are  
identified in tumor cells, the mitotic rate is not high.  The Ki67  
proliferation index is 4.7%.  While scattered tumor cells show positive  
immunohistochemical staining for GFAP, many tumor cells are negative  
for GFAP.  Immunohistochemical stain for p53 is negative in tumor  
cells.  Neither endothelial proliferation nor tumor necrosis is  
identified in the totally submitted surgical specimen.  An addendum

      Data Analysis:  
DESCRIPTION OF THE ASSAY: 1p and 19q FISH studies were performed on  
paraffin embedded tumor sections. Two hybridizations were performed:  
one with a 1p/1q probe/control pair and one with a 19q/19p  
 )   probe/contr ol pair.  The 19q and 1p probes map to regions that are  
commonly deleted in gliomas.  The nuclei are counterstained with DAPI  
and the cells examined by epi- fluorescence microscopy.  The total  
number of counts for each probe is determined in 200 cells and t he 
ratios of 1p/1q and 19q/19p are calculated.  
  
Normal range: The normal ratio is approximately 1. Any ratio > 0.80 is  
considered normal.  
  LIMITATIONS: Low levels of malignant cells in the specimen can result  
in a false negative result. As with all laboratory tests, sampling  
error and other factors may affect the outcome of the assay.  
Correlation of results with other clinical and laboratory data should  
be obtained.  
  COMMENT: This test was developed and its performance characteristics  
determined by the Molecular Pathology Laboratory at 
. It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S.  
Food and Drug Administration.  
This test is not to be used as a diagnostic procedure without  
confirmation of the diagnosis by another medically established product  
or procedure.

Discussion: The calculated MIB -1 labeling index ranges up to 14.7%, 
consistent with a high grade glial neoplasm.  
 
Microscopic Description:  Sections demonstrate a markedly hypercellular 
glial neoplasm that diffusely inf iltrates both gray and white matter. The 
majority of the tumor cells have round nuclei and well -formed perinuclear 
halos. Others cells have small eosinophilic caps with cytoplasm or 
microgemistocytic phenotype. The atypia is generally mild but many 
scatter ed moderately, or even markedly, atypical nuclei are seen. Mitotic 
activity is generally low, but in some areas up to 8 mitoses are seen in 10 high power fields. The tumor demonstrates both subpial condensation and perineuronal satellitosis. Neither  microv ascular proliferation nor  necrosis 
are seen. Overall, the focally high proliferative activity suggests early anaplastic transformation in the background of a low grade 
oligodendroglioma.  
 
Diagnosis:  Anaplastic Oligodendroglioma (WHO grade III).

PATHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS: 
Brain, site not specified! excision: 
1. Malignant glioma. 
2. Hyalinizing/reactive vasculopathy and necrosis. 
See Comment. 
COMMENT 
The sections contain small fragments of a malignant glioma that has 
mitotic 
figures and microvascular proliferation. There are also larger 
fragments of 
necrotic tumor. The vasculature is focally hyalinized and/or has 
reactive 
changes. Throughout the viable specimen there is prominent phagocytic 
activity. 
The findings are interpreted as viable and necrotic high histological 
grade 
glioma, and necrosis and vasculopathy associated with radiation 
injury.

MICROSCOPIC REPORT
Specimen I and 2 show features of Oli!odenelmg linnls ►. \VI-10 (2007) Grade II.
The tumour is infiltrative and is or moderate to dense: cellularity. It is composed of mostly round to
oval dells displaying mild nuclear pleomorphism, perinuclear halos and set in a fibriliary
background. Delicate branching vascular network is evident. In some areas, the tumo ur has a
demarcated pushing edge and the adjacent brain is severely gliotic with many gemistocytie
astrocytes and rosenthal-like fibres are seen (block 21)). There is perivascular lymphocy .ic cuffing.
There is adjacent brain cortex and leptomeninges seen in block 2A. Perinuclear satellitosis is not a
feature in this biopsy. Mitotic figures are very infrequent with only two isolated mitosis identified in
all tumour blocks. There is no necrosis or endothelial proliferation.

ANAPLASTIC. MIB-1 PROLIFERATION INDEX 3%.
SEE COMMENT.
----------------------------------------------------------------
Operation/Specimen: Brain, right frontal, excision.
Clinical History and Pre-Op Dx: year old man with large right
frontal brain tumor with focal enhancement.
GROSS PATHOLOGY:
A. Received fresh, three fragments, 1.5 cm across in aggregate.
Soft, mucinous, grayish-pink. #1-5.
INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION: Brain, smears: Glioma.
B.
SPECIMEN: Brain tumor permanent.
FIXATIVE: Saline.
GENERAL: Two glassy to pale tan soft tissue fragments, 1.0 cm. in
greatest dimension, and 2.0 x 1.0 x 0.7 cm. Largest
fragment is sectioned.
SECTIONS: All submitted in cassettes 6 and 7.
COMMENT: In part A there is a moderately cellular neoplastic
proliferation of glial cells. The neoplastic cells are predominantly
round, somewhat pleomorphic and disposed in a mucinous background with
microcystic change. Mitotic figures are rarely observed and
microvascular cellular proliferation or necrosis is absent.
In part B there are focal areas of a similar neoplasia. In addition,
there are zones with a better defined astrocytic or oligodendroglial
phenotype. In this specimen, however, there are zones of tumor
necrosis and microvascular cellular proliferation.
The findings are interpreted as a glial neoplastic proliferation,
probably mixed oligoastrocytic but predominantly astrocytic, that has
undergone focal anaplastic transformation (WHO grade III).
Microvascular proliferation and mitoses in the WHO classifications of
astrocytomas merit a grade IV category.
IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY: Immunoperoxidase methods for GFAP, CD34, p53,
and MIB-1 were performed on sections from block V. The GFAP
demonstrates sparse gliofibrilogenesis by neoplastic cells. The CD34
depicts the rich vascularity within the neoplasm. About 5% of cells
over-express the p53 antigen. With the MIB-1, a proliferation index of
3% is determined in the more cellular areas.

See Results and Comment. 
Results-Comments 
IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY: The GFAP demonstrates very sparse 
gliofibrillarity in 
the background, which focally is synaptophysin positive, interpreted 
as 
evidence of the infiltrative character of the neoplasm. The 
neoplastic cells 
do not over express the p53 protein. With the MIB-l there is a 
proliferation 
index of about 20% in the more active areas. The Neu N ( from the 
Hermelin 
Brain Tumor Center), a neuronal marker, depicts a few positive nuclei, 
focally. 
Comment: The immunophenotype is consistent with a high histological 
grade  oligodendroglioma. There may be a very minor component of neuronal 
elements, 
as may be observed in some oligodendrogliomas. The diagnosis remains 
as 
anaplastic oligodendroglioma.

MGMT Promoter 
Date Ordered: 
Interpretation Date Reported: 
POSITIVE: Methylated MGMT promoter is detected. 
Results-Comments 
Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block 
TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT promoter 
have been shown to benefit from therapy with alkylating agents. Assessment 
of  MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite treatment of DNA 
followed 
by real-time PCR amplification (MethyLight) of methylated and unmethylated 
DNA 
sequences. The analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by serial 
dilution of methylated positive control DNA into unmethylated DNA, and was 
assessed to be 1% of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated DNA. 
Factors such as the presence of >50% non-neoplastic cells in the sample, or 
extensive tissue necrosis, may preclude the detection of methylated MGMT 
promoter sequences. 
FDA COMMENT: The above be construed as the results from a 
stand alone diagnostic and its performance 
characteristics determined by the laboratory as 
required by CLIA ' IIIregulations. or approved for 
specific uses by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA has 
determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These results 
are 
provided for informational purposes only, and should be interpreted only in 
the context of established procedures and/or diagnostic criteria. 
Interpretation 
NEGATIVE -No evidence of EGFRvIII mutation is detected 
Results-Comments 
TEST DESCRIPTION: Testing performed on RNA extracted from tumor paraffin 
block 
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an attractive molecular 
target 
in glioblastoma because it is amplified, overexpressed, and/or mutated in up 
to 40% to 50% of patients. Epidermal growth factor receptor variant III 
(EGFRvIII) is an oncogenic, constitutively active mutant form of EGFR that 
is 
commonly expressed in glioblastoma. Cell culture and in vivo models of 
glioblastoma have demonstrated EGFRvlll as defining prognostically distinct 
subgroups of glioblastomas. Additionally, the presence of EGFRvIII has been 
shown to sensitize tumors to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors when the tumor 
suppressor protein PTEN is intact. RNA is extracted from formalin fixed, 
paraffin embedded tissue samples and reverse transcribed to cDNA. The cDNA 
is 
then amplified using standard PCR technique for DNA templates. PCR products 
are detected by gel electrophoresis. The limit of detection of this assay 
has 
been determined to be approximately 5 mutant cells in 100 normal cells. 
FDA Comment: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a

couple of abnormal vessels. 
D. ""4,H several fragments, 1.1 em across in aggregate. Brownish-red, 
soft, focally hemorrhagic. In total #8-12. 
MICROSCOPIC: A. Portions of cerebral cortex and adjacent white 
matter. The white matter appears hypercellular and rarefied. There 
is 
a uniform proliferation of astrocytes with star-like cytoplasm. In  between these cells, there are normal oligodendrocytes and a 
sprinkling 
of naked hyperchromatic nuclei, which are usually round or elongated. 
There are no mitotic figures or microvascular cellular proliferation. 
The cerebral cortex is unremarkable. 
B. Portions of cerebral cortex and white matter. The white matter is 
extensively rarefied and somewhat hypercellular with a sprinkling of 
atypical nuclei as described for part A. 
C. Portions of cerebral cortex and white matter in which there is a 
neoplasm similar to that one described for part A and B. However, in 
this specimen, the tumor appears more cellular, and is infiltrating 
the cerebral cortex with perineuronal satellitosis. There are also 
vessels with slight endothelial hyperplasia. Mitotic figures, 
microvascular cellular proliferation, and necrosis are absent. 
D. Portions of cerebral cortex and white matter with neoplasm similar 
to the one described above. In here, the neoplasm involves the 
cerebral cortex which is focally completely effaced. In some of these 
areas the background is very loose, scantily fibrillary, and suggests 
microcytic change. Again, features of anaplasia are absent. 
SPECIAL STAINS: Immunoperoxidase methods for GFAP and MIB-1 were 
performed on sections from blocks 4, 8 and 11. 
The GFAP brings up the diffuse but regular sprinkling of the lesion by 
star-like plump astrocytes, and a delicate fibrillary background. 
With 
the MIB-1 a proliferation index of 1.5% to 2% is determined in the 
more 
cellular areas. 
COMMENT: In all these specimens there is a low histOlogical grade 
glial neoplastic proliferation. The neoplastic cells are rounded or 
elongated hyperchromatic nuclei. The neoplastic cells are diffusely 
distributed throughout a rarefied brain parenchyma in which there is a 
prominent proliferation of astrocytes with prominent cytoplasm that 
resemble gemistocytes. In the area of enhancement, the tumor is more 
cellular and/or effaces the cerebral cortex. Throughout the tumor 
mitotic activity and microvascular cellular proliferation are 
inconspicuous. There are no areas of necrosis. This neoplasm is most 
likely an oligodendroglioma or mixed oligoastrocytoma. However, it 
may 
also be diagnosed as a low grade astrocytoma, perhaps with 
gemistocytic 
features, or as a protoplasmic astrocytoma. "," 1. Site: Brain. Justified as the report specifically mentions multiple excisional biopsies from different areas of the brain.

central area of the specimen , there are irregularly shaped cystic 
spaces surrounded by rarified white matter with neoplaslic glial cells 
and focal secretion of mucinOllS material. These spaces become 
confluent and form larger cysts. The enti.re specimen is permeated 
throughout by neoplastic cells with oligodendroglial characteristics , 
usually with :some pre:servation of the neuropil or while matter ,  , , 
occasionally with formation of nodules.

Clinical History and Pre-Op Dx: 
GROSS PATHOLOGY: Specimen is received in two containers labeled with 
the 
patient I s name, MRN and ""tfl ""left lobe tumor"", and #2 ""posterior 
temporal 
lobe"", 
Large fragments of an irregularly shaped grayish partly necrotic white 
tissue resembling brain are present in both containers. The first one 
measures 3.8 x 2.2 x 1.9 em. in greatest dimensions. Representative 
samples 
of this tissue are submitted in cassettes labeled 1-3. The second 
container 
encloses a fragment of cerebral tissue that measures 4.2 x 2.5 x 2.1 
ern. in 
greatest dimensions. Some areas of necrosis, hemorrhage, and 
infiltration 
by what appears to be a tumor are observed throughout most of this 
specimenl particularly in the portion of the lobe that corresponds to the 
subcortical 
white matter fibers. Representative samples of this second specimen 
are 
submitted in cassettes labeled 4 to 7. 
MICROSCOPIC: Almost all sections show infiltration by I',hat appears to 
be a 
very cellular tumor containing abundant atypical mitotic figures, 
markedly 
hyperplastic blood vessels and large areas of coagulation necrosis. 
Individual cells are relatively small and display minimum cytoplasm. 
The 
nucleus is relatively large and hypochrornatic. In a few areas the 
nuclear  chromatin features appear similar to those of adult astrocytes, 
however, in 
most places the tumor is markedly anaplastic and individual cells show 
very 
little resemblance to any adult glial cell. Nevertheless, on the 
basis of 
the nuclear features of the best differentiated elements of the tumor, 
I 
interpret these cells as being derived from astrocytes.

icroscopic 
Sections demonstrate a mildly to moderately hypercellular glial neoplasm that diffusely infiltrates the gray and white matter. The tumor cells have monotonous round to oval nuclei with little atypical.  Cytoplasm is promine nt and is often fibrillary that does 
demonstrate some microgemistocytic and a  few ordinary gemistocytic forms  Two mitoses are identified in 25 high power fields.  There is no microvascular proliferation or necrosis.  
 Addendum Sections demonstrate cortical gray and white matter.  The white matter is mildly hypercellular due to an infiltrate of tumor cells that have round, mildly enlarged round nuclei, often with a small nucleolus.  Most have obvious perinuclear halos.  No mitotic figures are seen.  In cont rast to the patient’s other material which demonstrated a typical 
astrocytoma phenotype, this material has a classic oligodendroglioma phenotype.  Taken together, the findings warrant classification as an oligoastrocytoma.

COMMENT: Many sections show a highly infiltrative, non-uniform glial 
neoplasm that in some areas shows low to intermediate-grade histology. 
However, section ""B3"" reveals areas of increased cellularity, 
pleomorphism, vascular proliferation and necrosis. Many tumor cells are 
strongly reactive for GFAP and the ki-67 labeling index varies from low 
to high in low and high grade areas of the tumor, respectively. These 
results support the diagnosis.

MICROSCOPIC REPORT
1-3. The processed paraffin sections confirm the frozen section diagnosis. The sections show brain
tissue in which there is a gemistocytic astrocytoma. The tumour is predominantly (60-70%)
composed of neoplastic gemistocytes with plump, glassy and eosinophilic cells bodies of angular
shape.A small amount of grade 2 fibrillary astrocytoma component is also present in the
background. No mitoses, necrosis ofendot.helial proliferation is seen. Adjacent non-neoplastic brain
shows prominent perivascular lymphocytic cuffing.
The tumour cells are strongly positive for GFAP. The Ki67 proliferation index is approximately 2%0.
lmmunohistochemical study for p53 and f3c12 is in progress. A supplementary report will follow.
COMMENT
Gemistocytic astrocytomas frequently are clinically aggressive and they have a poorer prognosis than
is suggested by their histological grade.

Diagnosis Comment: 
Section from posterior margin shows involvement by a moderate tumor infiltrate. 
ADDENDA: 
1 p and 19q FISH studies were performed on cells within paraffin sections from tumor. Two hybridizations were 
performed: one with a 19q probe/control19p pair and one with alp probe/controllq pair. The 19q and lp probes 
mapped to the regions that are commonly deleted in gliomas. The 19q to 19p probe ratio was 1.01. The lp to lq 
probe ratio was 0.99. For both probes, the normal ratio is approximately 1. Any ratio less than 0.80 is consistent 
with deletion of the chromosomal region of interest. 
There was no evidence of 1 p or 19q. However, approximately 45% of the cells had 3-4 copies of the 1 p, 1, 19p 
and 19q probes. Similar results have been observed in other glioma specimens with gain of chromosomes 1 and 
19. The results may also be consistent with tumor tetraploidy or aneuploidy.

 Microscopic  
1. 7 Sections demonstrate a mildly hypercellular glial neoplasm that is composed primarily 
of cells with round to oval nuclei and scant glial processes.  However, classic oligodendroglioma differentiation is not seen.  In addition, there are scattered moderately to marked ly atypical cells seen throughout.  No mitotic figures are seen and there is no microvascular proliferation or necrosis.  
2. Permanent section of the posterior margin demonstrates gray matter without hypercellularity or atypical cells to suggest neoplastic infiltration  
3. Permanent section of the deep margin demonstrates gray matter without hypercellularity or atypical cells to suggest neoplastic infiltration.  
4. Permanent section of the anterior martin demonstrates gray matter without hypercellularity or atypical cells to suggest neoplastic infiltration.  
5. Permanent section of the superior margin demonstrates gray matter without hypercellularity or atypical cells to suggest neoplastic infiltration  
6. Permanent section of the inferior margin demonstrates gray and white matter.  There is 
not sufficient hypercellularity and no atypical cells are seen to suggest infiltrating neoplasm.  
8.  Sections demonstrate gray and white matter with infiltrating neoplasm as previously described.  The tumor in this area does not demonstrate significantly greater hypercellularity or atypical.  Again, no mitotic figures and no microvascular proliferation or necrosis are seen.  
.  Addendum discussion : 
MIB-1 immunohistochemistry is performed on both the nonenhancing and enhancing portions of 
the tumor.  The former demonstrates only a few scattered MIB -1 positive cells.  The average 
index is <0.1% and the highest area is calculated at 1.6%.  In contrast, the enhancing area demonstrates many MIB -1 reactive cells.  In the highest areas, a labeling index of 5.0% is 
calculated.  This level of activity is indicative of moderate proliferation coupled with the contrast enhancement is worrisome for early anaplastic progression.  However, the overall histologic features are inadequate to classify this tumor as Grade III/anaplastic .

COMMENT: Sections show an infiltrating glioma with prominent nuclear and
cellular pleomorphism and non-uniformity and increased mitoses. No
definitive microvascular proliferation or necrosis is seen in this
material. Tumor cells and tumor cell processes are immunoreactive for GFAP. The tumor is positive for mutated isocitrate dehydrogenase 1
(IDH-1). P53 is immunoreactive in numerous tumor cell nuclei (50%
approximately). PHH3 confirms increased mitotic activity (up to 7
mitoses per 10 high power fields). Ki-67 confirms a focally elevated
proliferation index (up to 8% approximately). These findings support the
diagnosis.

Test description
Reference range: 1p/ 19q: Non-deleted
A tumor is considered to have 1p or 19q deletion when the 1p probe to 1q
probe ratio (1p/1q) or the 19q probe to 19p probe ratio (19q/19p) is
1.30. A tumor is considered to have chromosome 1 or 19 gain when the
percentage of nuclei with > or =3 signals is >20%. A normal 1p/1q ratio
is 0.9-1.05 and a normal 19q/19 p ratio is 0.93-1.02.
The test uses two dual-probe 1p36 probe combined with a
control 1q probe and a 19q13.3 probe combined with a control 19p probe.
Probes are specific to the minimally deleted regions of 1p (1p36) and 19q
(19q13.3) to detect 1p and 19q deletion. The selection of tissue and the
identification of target areas on the H&E stained slide is performed by a
pathologist. The number of 1p and 19q signals in the area of interest is scored. The testing was performed and performance characteristics of this
test were validated by the
It has not been cleared or approved by the FDA. This test is used for clinical purposes. It should
not be regarded as investigational or for research. This laboratory is

COMMENT: This markedly pleomorphic glioma contains areas of high 
cellularity and brisk mitotic activity. There is vascular endothelial 
proliferation and focal necrosis (A2) in this material from a tumor that 
.was ring-enhancing on MRI. Some (but not all) tumor cells are strongly 
immunoreactive for GFAP. The Ki-67 labeling index is quite high in areas 
and the tumor is strongly immunoreactive for p53 protein. Only 
perivascular reticulin is seen. 
The presence of highly cellular foci having high 
proliferative rate is reminiscent of a recently described subtype of 
malignant glioma that contains primitive neuroectodermal tumor-like 
(PNET-like) components.

icroscopic  
 
Sections demonstrate a moderately hypercellular glial neoplasm.  The tumor is composed of generally moderately atypical fibrillary astrocytes.  In addition, many bizarre, multinucleated cells are seen.  Neither microvascul ar proliferation nor 
tumor necrosis is present.   Only a rare mitotic figure is seen.  Which is 
unexpected given the degree of atypia.  Nevertheless, the cytologic features are unequivocally anaplastic.  No eosinophilic granular bodies or Rosenthal fibers are see n.  There is no microcystic degeneration.  
  Addendum  
 Scattered MIB -1 cells are seen throughout the tumor.  In the areas of highest 
proliferative activity,  a labeling index of 6.5% is calculated.  This is indicative of a moderately proliferative neoplasm that is consistent with  the anaplastic cytologic 
features.

TEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA (baseline)/ Tumor DNA
pairs using 3
markers at both 1 p and 19q. The 3 markers on 1 p are D1 S548, D1 S1592, and D1 S552 (with D1 S468,
D151612, and
D1S496 as backup markers) and the 3 markers on 19q are D19S219, D19S412, and PLA2G4C (with
D19S606 and
D19S1182 as backup). All markers are microsatellites (2 or 4 nt repeats) except PLA2G4C which is a
minisatellite (26
nt repeat) polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score, amplicon size, and
ease of
interpretation. The backup markers are used if the first line markers at that chromosome arm are
uninformative or
.otherwise ambiguous in their interpretation. LOH at all informative loci on each chromosomal arm
represents the
typical finding in oligodendrogliomas with 1 p and 19q deletion. FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a stand-alone diagnostic
test. This test

Administration (FDA). The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These
results are
provided for informational purposes only, and should be interpreted only in the context of established

MGMT Promoter Methylation
Date Ordered : Date Reported:
Interpretation
POSITIVE: Methylated MGMT promoter is detected.
Results -Comments
Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block (Cl).
H and E slide was examined and no microdissection was needed.
TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT promoter have been shown to
benefit
from therapy with alkylating agents .Assessment of MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite
treatment of
DNA followed by real-time PCR amplification of methylated and unmethylated DNA
sequences. The
analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by serial dilution of methylated positive control DNA into
unmethylated DNA, and was assessed to be 1 %of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated
DNA. Factors
such as the presence of >50 %non-neoplastic cells in the sample ,or extensive tissue necrosis, may
preclude the
detection of methylated MGMT promoter sequences.

IDHI Mutation Detection Assay
Date Ordered : Date Reported:
Interpretation
NEGATIVE - There is no evidence of IDH1 point mutation, as indicated by the absence of any nucleotide
changes in
codon 132 of the IDH1 gene compared to the electropherogram of the reference normal sample (wild
type).
Results -Comments TEST DESCRIPTION: IDH1 Mutation Analysis
Test performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block (Cl)
H and E slide was examined and no microdissection was needed.
Mutation of IDH1 occurs early in glioma progression with somatic mutations of the R132 residue of IDH1
identified in
majority (>70%) of grades II and III astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas, as well as in secondary GBMs
that
developed from these lower grade lesions. Mutation analysis of closely related IDH2 revealed mutations
of IDH2
residue R172, with most mutations occurring in tumors lacking IDHI mutations. Tumors with IDH1 or
IDH2 mutations
have distinctive genetic and clinical characteristics, and patients with such tumors have a better outcome
than those
with wild type IDH genes.
Mutations in IDH1/2 are detected by DNA sequencing procedures. The limit of detection of standard
bidirectional
sequencing is approximately 20-25%. In order to increase assay sensitivity tumor enrichment must be
performed by
manual microdissection when tumor cells in the block constitute less than 50% of nucleated cells.
FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a stand alone diagnostic
test. This test
was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the
as required by CLIA ""88 regulations. It has not been cleared or approved for specific uses by

A calculated MIB -1 labeling index is 2.7%  
 
Addendum Diagnosis:  
Oligodendroglioma, WHO grade II.  
 Microscopic Description:  
Microscopic examination reveals an infiltrating glioma. The tumor is composed of a proliferation of cells with predominantly round nuclei and 
mild to moderate nuclear pleomorphism. The tumor cells demonstrate prominent perinuclear halos. They diffusely infiltrate the adjacent brain parenchyma. Overall, the tumor appears mildly hype rcellular with focal 
regions showing increased hypercellularity. Occasional cells show more significant cytologic atypia, but overall the atypia appears mild to 
moderate. Scattered neurons demonstrate perineuronal satellitosis. Up to 
one mitotic figure per  10 high power field is identified. Neither 
microvascular proliferation nor necrosis are indentified.  
"," 1. ""Site"": Brain - The report clearly states the tumor is located in the brain based on the microscopic description.
2. ""Laterality"": Not provided - There is no mention of laterality (left or right) in this report.
3. ""Histology"": Oligodendroglioma - This is explicitly stated in the addendum diagnosis as WHO grade II oligodendroglioma.

histology with tumor cells having classic perinuclear haloes and
chicken-wire-like background capillaries. There are also areas of
increased cellularity with mitoses. The tumor extensively infiltrates
the cerebral cortex with prominent subpial and perineuronal accumulations
of neoplastic cells. The Ki-67 labeling index is 15-20%. A few
scattered cells are immunoreactive for GFAP while the majority of the
tumor is negative. These results support the diagnosis. Molecular
analysis for chromosomes 1p and 19q will be performed and reported as an
addendum to this report.

CLINICAL HISTORY 
3x]Jeri,enced severe left and 
some 
On imaging there are two 
contiguous 
lesions. One is large, parasagittal in the superior left frontal, has 
irregular enhancement, is probably extra axial, and is fed by a branch 
of the 
middle meningeal artery; this lesion is embolized. The second lesion 
is partially cystic, 5.5 em across, and is located inferiorly in the 
anterior 
frontal lobe; the mass enhances slightly and exerts mass effect in the 
lateral 
ventricle.

Operation/Specimen: A: Brain, excision biopsy 
B: Brain, I, excision biopsy 
c: Brain, intra-axial, excision biopsy 
0: Brain, medial portion, excision biopsy 
E: Brain, medial portion, excision biopsy 
PATHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS: 
A and B. 
1. Brain, sites not specified, excision: Meningioma (WHO I), 
extensively 
necrotic, previously embolized. 
2. MIB-l proLiferation index: 2%. 
C, D, and E. Brain, intraaxial, medial portion (FS), and medial  portion-permanent, excision: 
1. Glioblastoma. 
2. MIB-1 proliferation index: 30% to 35%. 
See Microscopy Description and Comment. 
COMMENT 
Parts A and B are portions of a fibrous meningioma that is extensively 
necrotic. In the few better preserved areas the mitotic index is 
about one / 
ten high power fields, and the proliferation index is about 2% in the 
more active areas. There is not brain tissue in the specimens submitted. 
Parts C, D, and E contain portions of a glial neoplasm that heavily 
infiltrates cerebral cortex and adjacent white matter. The neoplastic 
cells 
are very pleomorphic with frequent giant nuclei or multinucleated 
cells. The 
tumor has prominent nuclear anaplasia, frequent mitotic activity, 
prominent 
microvascular cellular proliferation, and zones of necrosis, some with 
pseudopalisading. The MIB-1 proliferation index is high, up to 35%. 
The findings are interpreted as those of a glioblastoma (WHO grade 
IV) . In part C the tumor is more infiltrative. In parts D and E the 
tumor is

POSITIVE: Methylated MGMT promoter is detected. 
Results-Comments 
Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block 
TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT 
promoter 
have been shown to benefit from therapy with alkylating agents. 
Assessment of 
MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite treatment of DNA 
followed 
by real-time PCR amplification (MethyLight) of methylated and 
unmethylated DNA 
sequences. The analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by 
serial dilution of methylated positive control DNA into unmethylated DNA, and 
was assessed to be 1% of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated 
DNA.  Factors such as the presence of >50% non-neoplastic cells in the 
sample, or 
extensive tissue necrosis, may preclude the detection of methylated 
MGMT 
promoter sequences.

Informative loci are: D1S548, D1S1592, D1S552, D19S2l9, and PLA2G4C 
Results-Comments 
TEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA 
(baseline)/ Tumor DNA pairs using 3 markers at both lp and 19q. The 3 
markers 
on lp are D1S548, D1S1592, and D1S552 (with D1S468, D1S1612, and 
D1S496 as 
backup markers) and the 3 markers on 19q are D19S219, D19S412, and 
PLA2G4C 
(""ith D19S606 and D19S1182 as backup). All markers are microsatellites 
(2 or 4 
nt repeats) except PLA2G4C which is a minisatellite (26 nt repeat) 
polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score, 
amplicon size, and ease of interpretation. The backup markers are used 
if the 
first line markers at that chromosome arm are uninformative or 
otherwise 
ambiguous in their interpretation. LOH at all informative loci on each 
chromosomal arm represents the typical finding in oligodendrogliomas 
""ith lp 
and 19q deletion.

IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY: 
The meningeal tumor has positive reaction with EMA. With the MIB-I, 
the 
proliferation index is about 2%; around zones of necrosis, it may be 
somewhat 
higher, as may be expected in tumors with embolization-induced 
necrosis. 
In the intra axial tumor, the GFAP demonstrates a dense gliofibrillary 
background throughout the specimen, even in the more cellular, less 
differentiated zones of the neoplasm. The synaptophysin and 
neurofilament 
depict the tumor densely infiltrating cerebral cortex and adjacent 
white 
matter, and absence of a neuronal neoplastic component. The great 
majority of 
neoplastic cells strongly over express the p53 protein. With the MIB-
1 the 
proliferation index ranges between 30% and 35% in the more densely 
infiltrated 
areas.

3 LOll. No "," Based on the excision biopsy report, the six categories are:

1. Site: The tumors are located in the brain, specifically in the meninges (meningioma) and intra-axial region (high-grade glial tumor).
2. Laterality: The exact laterality of the tumors is not provided in the report.
3. Histology: The meningioma is a necrotic epithelioid tumor, while the intra-axial tumor is a high-grade glial tumor with an oligodendroglioma component.
4. Stage: The stage of the tumors is not provided in the report.
5. Grade: The meningioma has a proliferation index of around 2%, while the intra-axial tumor has a proliferation index ranging between 30% and 35%. These indices suggest that the meningioma is low grade, while the intra-axial tumor is high grade.
6. Behavior: The behavior of the tumors is not explicitly stated in the report, but their high-grade nature suggests they are aggressive and have the potential to invade surrounding tissues.

Therefore, the six categories for the tumors described in the report are:

Site: brain (meninges and intra-axial region)
Laterality: not provided
Histology: necrotic epithelioid meningioma and high-grade glial tumor with oligodendroglioma component
Stage: not provided
Grade: low grade for the meningioma (around 2% proliferation index) and high grade for the intra-axial tumor (30-35% proliferation index)

COMMENT: The specimens contain cerebral cortex and white matter that 
are diffusely infiltrated by a glial neoplastic proliferation. The 
neoplastic cells have uniform round nuclei devoid of cytoplasm, and 
display prominent perineuronal satellitosis. Focally, the neoplastic 
cells have perinuclear halos. There is slight pleomorphism, and 
mitotic figures, microvascular cellular proliferation, and necrosis 
are  absent. The phenotype of the tumor is that of one with loss of 
heterozygosity. 
ADDENDUM REPORT 
IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY: Immunoperoxidase methods for GFAP, CD34, p53, 
and MIB-1 were performed on sections from block #3. 
The GFAP demonstrates scant gliofibrillogenesis. The CD34 depicts a 
capillary-type microvasculature, without microvascular cellular 
proliferation. The neoplastic cells do not overexpress the p53 
protein. With the MIB-1 a proliferation index of about 2% is 
determined in the more active areas. 
SPECIAL STAIN REPORT: Bielschowsky stain was performed on sections 
from block #3. 
The special stain demonstrates no distortion of the normal axonal 
pattern by the neoplastic cells.

COMMENT:  
This high grade glioma shows regions of astrocytic differentiation 
as well as 
oligodendroglial differentiation. There is extensive necrosis, 
including the 
pseudopalisading type, and abundant microvascular hyperplasia I 
fulfilling 
diagnostic criteria for glioblastoma. Immunohistochemistry for p53 
shmvs 
strong nuclear positivity in nearly every cell. The MIBI 
proliferation index 
is approximately 40%. FISH studies for chromosome IP are 
borderline for 
deletion Nhile FISH for chromosome 19q is positive for deletion. 
FISH for 
EGFR is negative for amplification. Studies for chromosome 10q23 
(p10) do not 
show a deletion. The morphologic, immunohistochemical and 
molecular studies 
are most consistent with a diagnosis of glioblastoma \""lith

FLUORESCENCE IN SITU HYBRIDIZATION 
INTERPRETATION: 
Fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed using the above 
listed DNA 
 probes ). The probes were simultaneously 
hybridized to 
a section of the formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue submitted 
for 
evaluation. 
Of 200 interphase nuclei analyzed, 13% demonstrated loss of signal 
for the 
BORDERLINE lp36 probe which indicates the presence of deletion for 
chromosome 
Ip36. Correlation \1ith clinical and other laboratory parameters is 
suggested. 
Of 200 interphase nuclei analyzed, 30% demonstrated loss of signal 
for the 
19q13 probe which indicates the presence of deletion for chromosome 
19q13. 
Correlation with clinical and other laboratory parameters is 
suggested. 
Of 200 interphase nuclei analyzed, 94% of cells were NEGATIVE for 
EGFR gene 
amplification. Positive and negative controls were appropriate. 
Correlation 
with clinical and other laboratory parameters is suggested. 
Of 200 interphase nuclei analyzed, 92% demonstrated a normal number 
of signals 
for the PTEN probe which indicates the absence of deletion for 
chromosome 
10q23. Correlation with clinical and other laboratory parameters is 
suggested. 
COMMENT:  
The results of this test should not be used alone as the sole basis 
for 
diagnosis and/or treatment. These results may, however, prove 
useful when 
used in conjunction with other diagnostic procedures and clinical 
evaluations. Use of these results, in this manner, can be 
considered to fall 
within the scope of practice of medicine. This test was developed 
and its 
performance characteristics determined by the
Laboratories. It 
has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration.

 Pathology Report for Subject 
 
Diagnosis:  
Oligoastrocytoma, WHO grade II  
- MIB-labeling index = 6.1%  
 
Microscopic Description : 
Sections demonstrate a markedly hypercellular glial neoplasm that diffusely infiltrates the parenchyma. The majority of the tumor cells have an 
astrocytoma phenotype, but a significant minority show either poorly 
formed paranuclear halos or a microgemistocytic phenotype, consistent 
with oligodendroglioma differentiation. Atypia is generally mild, but many 
moderately atypical nuclei are present. Only rare mitotic figures are identified. Microvascular proliferation is not seen. MIB -labeling 
immunoreactivity varies throughout the tumor. In the most proliferative areas, the labeling index of 6.1% is calculated. This is an intermediat e level 
of proliferative activity. Although it does not warrant definitive classification as grade III, anaplastic, it is worrisome for aggressive behavior.  
"," 1. ""Site"": Brain - The report clearly states the diagnosis of oligoastrocytoma, a type of brain tumor.
2. ""Laterality"": Not provided - The report does not specify whether the tumor is located in the left or right hemisphere of the brain.
3. ""Histology"": Oligoastrocytoma - The report clearly states the diagnosis as oligoastrocytoma, a mixed glial neoplasm.
4. ""Stage"": Not provided - The report does not provide sufficient information to determine the stage of the tumor.
5. ""Grade"": II - The report specifically states that the tumor is a grade II oligoastrocytoma.
6. ""Behavior"": Malignant - As a cancerous brain tumor, the behavior of this tumor is inherently malignant.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The sample consists of a fragment of tissue with a size of 3.5 x 2.1 cm. The specimen is partially covered by a fibrous capsule. In the subcapsular region, there is a tumor focus of 1.8 cm in its greatest dimension. The tumor demonstrates diffuse growth and consists of atypical cells with hyperchromic nuclei and scant cytoplasm. Mitotic activity is high. Necrosis is present. Vascular invasion is not identified. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells show positivity for CK7, CK19, and Ki-67 (labeling index 40%). The findings are consistent with a high-grade malignant neoplasm, morphologically and immunophenotypically suspicious for a primary pulmonary adenocarcinoma.

TEST DESCRIPTION: Testing performed on RNA extracted from paraffin tissue block (Al)
H and E slide was examined and no microdissection was needed.
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an attractive molecular target in glioblastoma because it
is amplified,
overexpressed, and/or mutated in up to 40% to 50% of patients .Epidermal growth factor receptor variant
III
(EGFRvIII) is an oncogenic ,constitutively active mutant form of EGFR that is commonly expressed in
glioblastoma.
Cell culture and in vivo models of glioblastoma have demonstrated EGFRvIII as defining prognostically
distinct
subgroups of glioblastomas .Additionally , the presence of EGFRvIII has been shown to sensitize tumors
to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors when the tumor suppressor protein PTEN is intact. RNA is extracted from
formalin fixed,
paraffin embedded tissue samples and reverse transcribed to cDNA. The cDNA is then amplified using
standard PCR
technique for DNA templates .PCR products are detected by gel electrophoresis .The limit of detection of
this assay
has been determined to be approximately 5 mutant cells in 100 normal cells.
FDA Comment :The above data are not to be construed as the results from a stand alone diagnostic test.
This test
was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the
as required
by CLIA ' 88 regulations .It has not been cleared or approved for specific uses by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA). The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These

Date Ordered : Date Reported:
Interpretation
NEGATIVE: No evidence of methylated MGMT promoter is detected.
Results -Comments
Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block (Al)
H and E slide was examined and no microdissection was needed.
TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT promoter have been shown to
benefit
from therapy with alkylating agents. Assessment of MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite
treatment of
DNA followed by real-time PCR amplification of methylated and unmethylated DNA
sequences. The
analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by serial dilution of methylated positive control DNA into
unmethylated DNA, and was assessed to be 1 % of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated
DNA. Factors
such as the presence of >50% non-neoplastic cells in the sample ,or extensive tissue necrosis, may
preclude the
detection of methylated MGMT promoter sequences.
FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a stand alone diagnostic
test. This test
was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the
as required
by CLIA'88 regulations. It has not been cleared or approved for specific uses by the U.S. Food and Drug

FISH studies for 1 p and 19q deletion will be performed and reported as an addendum. 
ADDENDA: 
lp and 19q FISH studies were performed on cells within paraffin sections from tumor. Two hybridizations were 
performed: one with a 19q probe/control19p pair and one with alp probe/controllq pair. The 19q and lp probes 
mapped to the regions that are commonly deleted in gliomas. The 19q to 19p probe ratio was 0.56. The lp to lq 
probe ratio was 1.02. For both probes, the normal ratio is approximately 1. Any ratio less than 0.80 is consistent 
with deletion of the chromosomal region of interest. 
The results are less than the normal range and suggest deletion of 19q. Approximately 90% of cells had 2 copies 
of the 19q probe and 3-4 copies of the 19p probe, consistent with relative loss of 19q. In addition, approximately 
80% of cells had 3-4 copies of the lp and lq probe. The results have been observed in other glioma specimens 
with tumor aneuploidy (or polyploidy) and relative loss of 19q.

re^b -3 Microscopic ExaminationSections of all three specimensare similar and will be described together. They
display a glial, infiltrative tumor of astrocytic lineage. The neoplasm is
moderately hypercellular and displays mild nuclear pleomorphism and hyperchromasia.
Scattered mitotic figuresare seenbut there is no microvascular proliferation or
necrosis present..
immunohistochemistry for glial fibrillary acidic protein is diffusely positive in
the tumor.MIB-1, a proliferation marker, is positive in approximately 10% of the
nuclei.IDH-1 st-Ainirn is necative.All controls are appropriate. ACCESSION

Calculated lp/lq ratio = 0.49 (<0.74 is deleted)
Calculated 19q/19p ratio = .055 (<0.88 is deleted)
The results are interpreted as deleted for ip and 19q. This assay was read by Dr.
A result of a deleted ip and 19q suggests a favorable prognosis. A solitary ip
a
deletion suggests an intermediate prognosis.A 19q solitary deletion may suggest
favorable prognosis in a smaller subset of tumors. The lack of either 1p and/or
19q deletion(s) is considered a poor prognostic indicator and may be associated
with decreased disease-free survival and overall survival.
