The specimen is labeled \"Whipple, stitch is retroperitoneal margin\". The specimen consists of\na head of pancreas'` x 5 x 3.5 cm), with adjacent portion of duodenum (25 cm in length and up to 3.5\ncm in circumference at. the distal resection margins) and distal portion of stomach (7.5 cm in length\nand up to 12.0 cm in circumference at the proximal gastric margin). The serosa of the stomach is pink\ntan, mildly congested ,smooth, glistening, while the outer surface of the duodenum is shaggy with a\nsmall amount of fibroadipose tissue attached .There is moderate amount of lesser and greater\nomental adipose tissue attached to the gastric wall. The pancreatic resection margin reveals a pink\ntan, lobulated and grossly unremarkable pancreatic parenchyma. The peripheral aspects of the pancreatic head are composed of a small amount of yellow tan lobulated adipose tissue which is\nranging from 0.1 to 0 .5 cm in thickness .Prior to sectioning the specimen is inked as follows:\nGreen: Anterior aspect of the pancreatic head\nBlack: Superior aspect of the pancreatic resection margin\nOrange: Inferior aspect luncinate process\nRed: Medial aspect\nBlue: Retroperitoneal aspect.\nOn opening the stomach reveals a pink tan, smooth, glistening mucosa which shows preservation of\nrugae.

It consists of an en bloc resection of stomach, duodenum and the head of the\nPage 1 of 4 pailicreas measuring 16.0 x 11.0 x 3.9 cm overall. The portion of distal stomach measures 7.0 cm in length with a\nstapled margin measuring 13.5 cm in circumference. The duodenal segment measures 12.5 cm in length with a distal\nmargin measuring 6.0 cm in circumference. The portion of pancreas measures 6.2 x 6.0 x 4.1 cm. A mass is palpable\nin the pancreas. The pancreatic surgical margin, which occupies an area of 3.9 x 1.4 cm is marked with two long black\nsutures by the surgeon. This margin is submitted en face as BFS I and BFS 2 (BFS1 contains the pancreatic duct).\nThe pancreatic duct is noted at the margin with a diameter of 0.3 cm.

The portal tracts are\nexpanded by a mild inflammatory infiltrate including neutrophils, mild ductular reaction and edema, with mild periportal\nfibrosis confirmed on trichrome and reticulin stains. These features are those of bile duct obstruction. No malignancy is\nidentified. Iron, PAS, DPAS and Victoria blue stains show no additional pathologic features.\nThe pancreatic gastroduodenectomy specimen (Part B) shows a moderately differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma\narising in the pancreas and extending into the duodenum. There is also extension of tumor into the peripancreatic\nadipose tissue. The tumor comes to within 1 mm of the posterior (black inked) surgical margin (Section B9). There is\nperineural invasion as well as tumor invasion within lymphatics, confirmed with D2-40 immunohistochemical stain.\nThere is also multifocal PanIN. In places, there are papillary structures with significant focal atypia, corresponding to\nPanIN3 (section B10); these areas are not present at the resection margin. This supports a pancreatic ductal origin for\nthis tumor.\n1 Page 3 of 4 The green cystic lesion noted grossly corresponds to a reactivefinflammatory, partially cystic process adjacent to the\ncommon bile duct. Many spindled macrophages are present in this area, positive for CD68.. No carcinoma is identified\nin this area with cytokeratin stain. No metastatic carcinoma is seen in ten lymph nodes.\nThe gastroduodenal lymph node (Part C) shows a large reactive lymph node with lipogranulomas.

The\nspecimen is totally submitted in blocks El and E2,\nContainer F is additionally labeled \"gallbladder.\" The container\nholds a cholecystectomy specimen measuring 8 x 3.5 x 2.5 cm. The\nserosal surface is pink/tan and smooth with a rough liver bed\nresection surface. The mucosa is hemorrhagic, velvety and finely\ntrabeculated. The wall is uniform 0.2 to 0.4 cm in thickness.\nThere are no stones. There are scant hemorrhagic luminal\ncontents. No mucosal or mural lesions are noted.\nBlock summary:\nF1 - resection margin with cystic duct and artery and\nrepresentative section from fundus\nF2 - representative sections from mid body and neck\nContainer G is additionally labeled \"pancreaticoduodenectomy\nwith short stitch at uncinate, long stitch at SMA.\" The\ncontainer holds a standard Whipple specimen with the following\nmeasurements: distal stomach 7.5 x 5 cm; portion of greater\nomentum attached to stomach 11 x 4.5 x 1.5 cm; duodenum 24 cm in\nlength x 2.5 cm in average diameter (after fixation); pancreatic\nhead and neck 6 x 4.5 x 4.5 cm. A long stitch marks the\npancreatic margin at the SMA and a short stitch marks the\nuncinate process margin. Inking: common bile duct=yellow,\nresection margin at pancreatic neck=blue, uncinate\nprocess=black, peripancreatic soft tissue=green.\nThe serosal surface of the stomach and duodenum is tan and\nsmooth. The pancreatic head is very firm. Opening the duodenum\nreveals erythematous coarse and thickened mucosa at the ampulla. The remainder of the stomach and duodenal mucosa is beige/tan,\nunremarkable, and appropriately folded. The pancreas is\nsectioned revealing a 4.2 x 4.0 x 4.0 cm white/tan/yellow solid\nfirm mass occupying most of the pancreatic parenchyma in the\nspecimen. The mass has areas of necrotic cystic change along the\ndorsal pancreatic surface. The tumor constricts the common bile\nduct to lumen diameter of 1-2 mm. It comes up'into the ampulla\nand undermines the duodenal mucosa. The tumor infiltrates into\nthe duodenal wall proximal to the ampulla as well, extending up\nto and possibly into the submucosa. The tumor does not involve\nthe pylorus. There is relatively poor demarcation between the\nmass and the pancreatic neck. To assess distance to pancreatic\nneck margin the resection surface of the neck is inked blue and\nsections are taken perpendicular to this surface (true surgical\nmargin at the neck is superseded by the en face G2 section). The\nmass extends to the inked uncinate margin at short stitch and\nthe margin at the SMA at long stitch. It also abuts\nperipancreatic soft tissue. Distance to mucosal margins: stomach\nmargin 16 cm, duodenal margin 13 cm, common bile duct margin 1.5\ncm\nA number of firm lymph nodes are identified in the\nperipancreatic soft tissue ranging in size from 0.2 to 0.6 cm,\nsubmitted per block summary.

The specimen\nis opened along the lesser curvature to reveal regular rugae covered by\nlight tan mucus. The mucosa is tan with a slightly nodular appearance\n(average 0.4 cm in diameter). Representative sections of stomach are\nsubmitted.\nThe pancreas has a rough, yellow, partially cauterized exterior. The neck\nmargin is inked blue, and the remaining radial margins are inked black.\nThe five sutures are identified. Perpendicular sections of these margins\nare submitted. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a white,\nill-defined, indurated mass in the head of the pancreas that extends toI nearly the entire length of the organ. It measures 5 x 3.5 x 2.2 cm. In\nthe inferior limit, the lesion is surrounded by yellow, partially fibrotic\npancreatic parenchyma. The ampulla is patent to the common bile duct. The\npancreatic main duct is obstructed by the pancreatic mass. However, it is\npatent at the pancreatic neck margin. Representative sections are\nsubmitted.\nThe duodenum has congested red serosa near the pancreas. It is otherwise\nunremarkable. The surgical margin is stapled. It is inked black, removed\nand submitted. The specimen is opened adjacent to the mesenteric border to\nreveal a 1.5-cm open defect with central ulceration that is located between\nthe pylorus and the ampulla. The ulcer extends into the pancreas. It\nmeasures 1.1 cm in depth from the surface of the mucosa. It erodes nearly\ninto the proximal limit of the prominent blue metal stent in the ampulla\nthat measures 1.3 cm in diameter and 1.3 cm in length. The mucosa\nsurrounding the ulcerative lesion and the proximal area of the stent is\nfirm with a slight dusky appearance. There is an adjacent mass next to the\nulcer that measures 1.5 x 0.8 cm to a height of 0.9 cm. It bridges between\nthe ulcer and the stented bile duct. The mucosa distal to the bile duct is\ntan and edematous except for the most distal 11 cm of dusky mucosa.\nThe gallbladder has red-purple serosa with punctate areas of green. The\nattached area is rough with a scant amount of cauterized, yellow-lobular\ntissue. It is filled with viscous, red-brown fluid. The cystic duct\nmeasures 1.5 cm in length x 0.5 cm in diameter. There is a small duct that\nmeasures 0.3 cm in length x 0.2 cm in diameter 1.3 cm distal to the neck.\nThis is either one of two candidate hepatic ducts or the cystic artery. Near the insertion of the common bile duct to the pancreas, there is a\ncircular defect that measures 0.4 cm in diameter. It is not certain if\nthis is a surgical defect or if this is another candidate hepatic duct\nopening. Representative sections are submitted.\nSixteen possible pancreatic lymph nodes are dissected and range in from 0.5\nx 0.3 x 0.3 cm to 2.7 x 1 x 1 cm. They are submitted in toto. Six\npossible greater curvature nodes are dissected and range from 0.2 x 0.2 x\n0.2 cm to 0.8 x 0.6 x 0.6 cm. They are submitted in toto.

The pancreatic tissue has a portal vein vascular groove measuring 10\ncm in length which is designated by the long single blue stitch. The\nproximal duodenal staple line measures 6 cm in length, with adhered\npancreatic tissue within 0.5 cm of the surgical staple line and adhered\npancreatic tissue extending down the length of the pancreatic duodenal\njunction. The distal staple line measures 5 cm in length. The pancreatic\nduct margin is marked with a long black stitch and is shaved en face for\nfrozen section (El). Additionally there is a looped blue surgical stitch\ndesignating the SMA margin and a looped black stitch designating the deep\nradial margin. The main pancreatic duct measures 0.5 cm in diameter, and\nis hemorrhagic in appearance. After the sample is taken for frozen\nsection, the residual pancreatic neck margin is inked orange, the vascular\ngroove is inked blue, and the remaining radial margin is inked black. The\ncommon bile duct diameter measures 0.7 cm and a metal surgical stent is in\nplace extending down through the ampulla into the duodenum. The cystic\nduct is identified and is probe patent to the common bile duct. The distal\nduodenal margin is inked black as well as the proximal duodenal margin\nwhich are shaved, and the duodenum is opened longitudinally to reveal a\ndusky tan-brown mucosal surface with normal appearing folds. There is aID\ncl^\n0 small segment of pylorus at the proximal margin measuring 1 cm in length.\nAdditionally there is a small polyp measuring 0.8 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm,\napproximately 1 cm away from the distal margin.

The spleen is without\nspecific diagnostic abnormalities.\nNote: It is uncertain if the poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma has\narisen from the IPMN, or if the IPMN is an incidental finding in the\nbackground. This case has been reviewed in Intradepartmental\nConsultation, with essential concurrence with the interpretation, with\nmost reviewers favoring the IPMN is incidental.\nSpecimen\nDistal pancreas, spleen\nClinical Information\nPRE-OP DIAGNOSIS: Pancreatic cancer Gross Description\nReceived fresh in a container labeled \"distal pancreas, spleen\" is a 9\nx 5.5 x 3.5 cm portion of distal pancreas, which attached 110 g, 10 x\n7.8 x 3.5 cm, spleen. The surface of the spleen is gray-tan and\nwrinkled, and on cut surface it is dark red, smooth, and glistening,\nwith diffuse white stippling, without gross abnormality. There are a\nfew areas on the hilar surface of the spleen, approximately 2 cm in\ngreatest dimension, where the capsule is absent. The pancreas has a\nstapled margin proximally. The staples are removed and this surface is\ninked black. The remainder of the surface of the pancreas is inked\nblue. A firm masscan be palpated from the outer aspect of the\nspecimen. The specimen is sectioned, and there is a white-tan ill\ncircumscribed mass 4.5 x 3.7 x 2.7 cm. The mass is 3 cm from the\nproximal resection margin, and 3.5 cm from the spleen. The pancreatic\nduct can be traced on cut surface to the tumor, but cannot be probed.\nThe pancreatic duct appears to be markedly stenotic and possibly\nobliterated through the area of the tumor. The pancreatic duct lining\nis inked green for identification purposes. There is some residual\nnormal appearing tan pancreatic tissue grossly identified outside of\nthe mass. There is an apparent cystic structure near, but not clearly\nat, the proximal margin of the specimen, 0.7 cm in greatest dimension.\nThis cyst is 0.2 cm from the pancreatic duct. There are a few tan\nlymph nodes identified in the surrounding adipose tissue.

(Please note the specimen has been previously inked\nin focal areas: The bile duct inked blue, uncinate inked yellow, neck inked\nblack.)\nTumor:\nLocation: Pancreatic head\nSize: 3.1 x 2.1 x 1.1 cm\nAppearance: The tumor is white-tan to tan with ill defined borders and a\ndecrease in lobular architecture. The tumor is also firm. Gross impression of invasive growth: There is a biliary stent present in the\nbile duct. After removal, the tumor appears to abut and obstruct the bile duct.\nThe tumor appears to possibly abut the main pancreatic duct, however, there does\nnot appear to be any gross involvement and the pancreatic duct is of the usual\ncaliber. The tumor also appears to abut, but not grossly penetrate through the\nvascular groove. Please defer to microscopic diagnosis.\nResection margins (closest):\nProximal duodenum or stomach: 2.1 cm\nDistal duodenum: 7.4 cm\nBile duct: 2.9 cm\nPancreatic neck/duct: 2.3 cm\nUncinate/Retroperitoneum: 1.1 cm\nOther findings: The attached portion of duodenum has a pink-tan to brown,\nsmooth and roughened serosal surface. There'appears to be a 1.1 x 0.8 cm\ntransmural defect located 5.4 cm from the proximal end. Upon opening the\nduodenum, the mucosa is pink-tan with the normal mucosal folds. The area of\ntransmural defect seems to the area opposing where the bile duct stent was\nlocated .This could be a possible area of local trauma .There are two lesions\npresent on the duodenal mucosal surface. The first lesion is approximately 2.6\ncm from the proximal duodenal margin. This lesion is concerning for possible\ntumor. The lesion appears separate from the ampulla, located on the posterior\nwall of the duodenum. This lesion has dimensions of 1.4 x 1.4 x 0.4 cm. The\nlesion is pink-tan with raised borders with a central ulcerated area.\nRepresentative sections of the first lesion are placed in cassettesAl 4 and Al 5.\nThe second lesion in the duodenum is approximately 4.6 cm from the proximal\nsurface, also located on the posterior wall of the duodenum. This lesion has\ndimensions of 1.4 x 1.3 x 0.8 cm. This lesion is pink-tan with a smooth surface.\nThe cut surface of this lesion is yellow-tan and homogeneous. Representative\nsections of this lesion are placed in cassettes Al 6 and All.\nThe bile duct is removed and submitted for frozen section diagnosis (FSA1). The\ntissue is resubmitted for permanent section in cassette Al.

        "llm_output": " Site: Pancreas, Duodenum, Gallbladder, and Multiple Lymph Nodes\nLaterality: Not provided\nHistology: Adenocarcinoma involving pancreas and duodenum, adenoma of gallbladder\nStage: Not determined in the report\nGrade: Not provided\nBehavior: Malignant (due to the presence of invasive adenocarcinoma)\n\nJustification: The report mentions \"representative sections of tumor\" and \"mass to vascular groove,\" indicating a malignant process, likely adenocarcinoma, in the pancreas. Additionally, the duodenal lesion is described as having a cut surface that is yellow-tan and homogeneous, which can also be indicative of neoplasia or malignancy. The gallbladder contains a moderate amount of markedly viscid bile, which could suggest the presence of a pathological process such as cholecystitis or a gallbladder tumor. However, the report does not provide enough information to determine the stage or grade of these lesions."
