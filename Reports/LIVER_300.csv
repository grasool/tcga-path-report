SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT
FINAL PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS:
A: Bile duct, distal margin, excision
-Positive, or detached fragments of hepatocellular carcinoma
B: Bile duct, distal margin #2, excision
-Negative for carcinoma.
C: Bone, xiphoid, excision
-Bone with trilineage hematopolesis.
-Unremarkable cartilage and adipose tissue.
-Negative for carcinoma.
1D:Gallbladder , cholecystectomy
-Gallbladder with chronic cholecystitis and focal intestinal metaplasia.-iVegative, f or carcinoma.
E: Liver, right hepatic lobe, partial hepatectorny
-hlepatocellular carcinoma, poorly differentiated.
Page I of 5 -Margins negativ e for carcinoma (see Comment).
-Background liver with incomplete cirrhosis (stage 5 out of b) and
hemosiderosis (patchy positive 2+14 staining in fiepatocytes and 3+14
staining in Kupffer cells).
-Pathologic Stage : pT2 NX (see Comment and Synoptic Report).
F: Vein, portal bifurc ation ,excision
-Unremarkable vein and soft tissue.
-Negative for carcinoma.
COMMENT: The tumor consists of a poorly differentiated carcinoma composed of malignant
cells with course or vesicular chromatin, occasional prominent nucleoli, and a moderate amount
of amphiphilic cytoplasm arranged in dense sheets or pseudoglandular structures with associated.
prominent interspersed inflammation. There are scattered multinucleated cells. In part F.
inununohistoehemieal stains were performed. (block El0) and demonstrate that the tumor is
strongly positive for glypican 3, and negative for CK7, CK20, and hepatocyte specific antigen
(Hep-earl ). The histomorphotogy and immunohistochemical profile is consistent with a poorly
differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma. The previous outside biopsy Fwas
reviewed in conjunction with the current case and the tumors are histologically similar. The
tumor closely approachcs (less than 0.1 cm), but does not involve, the parenchymal margin of
action. This case was intradcpartmentally reviewed on

frozen section analysis with blue ink indicating the surgical resection ma and green ink on t he capsule .A bluestitch has been applied at the arcs oftible attached diaphragm at the superior aspect of the specimen .The distal
bile duct margin is inked orange. The bile duct is serially sectioned from distal to proximal to reveal a markedlydilated (1.0. cm in diameter )lumen tilled with soft tan-white friable tumor ,extending the length .of the bile duct up to
the left duct orifice. The tumor appears confuted within the lumen of the bile duct with no direct extension between
liver parenchyma and bile duct .The liveris serially sectioned to reveal an ill-defined white fur mass measuring 7.5x 7,0 x 4.0 cm extending from. the superior to mid aspect of the specimen and abutting the green and blue-inked
surface. Additionally, there Is a cystic space measuring 2.0 x 2.0 x I.0 cm in the am underlying the diaphragm
filledwith green yellow soft material. The remainder of the liver parenchyma is remarkable for dif'tcirrhosiswithout other masses or lesions .Representative sections arcs .submitted per cassette summary.

diagnosis. Grass Description
A. The specimen is received fresh. labeled '"" segment 5 resection"". The specimen consists of
604.0 gram segmentectomy resection of liver which measures 1x6.0 x 11.0 x 7.0 cm. The capsule of
the specimen is pink-tan to red-brown, focally hemorrhagic, and has bosselated surface. The
parench^,anal resection margin is tan-red-brown, focally cauterized and is inked blue. The specimen is
serially sectioned to reveal an irregular, ill-defined lobulated intraparenehymal tumor mass which
measures 11.0 x 9.0 x 7.0 cm. The tumor is bulging capsule and is 1.0 cm from the closest
parenchymal resection margin- T G tumor mass is focally hemorrhagic and necrotic... The areas of
necrosis range from 0.1 to -2_5 cm in greatest dimension, and occupy less than 10% of the tumor.
Representative section of the tumor in relation to the closest parenchymal resection margin is
submitted for frozen section as FSAI. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted to the
Tissue Procurement Laboratory- Additional sections of the specimen are submitted in 6 cassettes as
follows:
A2-A5,. Tumor bulging capsule

Dl"," Site: Personally, I would interpret the description ""Tunica"" to be referring to the site as the ""serosa"" or ""peritoneum,"" but it is not explicitly stated in the text. The term ""Tunica"" is often used in anatomical context to refer to a membranous cover or sheath, such as the serous membrane that surrounds the liver. However, without further clarification, I cannot be certain.

Laterality: Not provided

Histology: The specimen consists of a ""stony"" ovoid mass with granular brown tissue and an irregular border, which suggests a diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or another type of malignant liver tumor. However, the specific histological diagnosis is not provided in the text.

Stage: The size and weight of the specimen suggest that it may be a relatively advanced-stage tumor, but the staging information is not explicitly stated in the text.

Grade: Not provided

Behavior: Based on the description of the tumor as ""stony"" and irregularly bordered, I would classify its behavior as malignant. However, this classification is not explicitly stated in the text.

Justification: The choice of site, histology, stage, grade, and behavior is based on a careful reading of the provided text and an interpretation of the available information. While some details are missing or unclear, I have made my best judgment based on the evidence presented.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

e Reviewed:"," Site: The primary tumor is located in the liver.

Laterality: The laterality is not explicitly mentioned in the description, so it cannot be determined.

Histology: The tumor is a malignant neoplasm, with features suggestive of hepatocellular carcinoma based on the presence of necrotic and hemorrhagic areas, as well as the appearance of cancerous cells in the resected margin.

Stage: The stage is not provided, but the description suggests an advanced-stage tumor due to its large size and involvement of the hepatic vein.

Grade: The grade is not explicitly mentioned, but the presence of necrotic areas may indicate a high-grade malignancy.

Behavior: The behavior of this tumor is malignant, as it exhibits features consistent with cancerous growth and invasion into surrounding tissues.

Justification: The diagnosis is based on the description of gross and microscopic findings, including the presence of necrotic areas, hemorrhage, and infiltration of cancer cells into surrounding tissues.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

measures 10 x 9 x 9 cm; the gallbladder measures 8 x 2.5 x 2_5 cm.. The surgical resection margin of
the liver is inked blue- The external surface of the liver is mostly smooth, but with focal nodular area-
On sectioning, there is a tumor measuring 8 x 8.5 x, 0.5 cm. The tumor is well circumscribed. The cut
surface of the tumor is gray to pink with multilobulated appearance. Necrosis and hemorrhage are
present. In the center of the tumor there is a. stellate scar .The tumor is 0_7 cm from the closest
parenchymal surgical resection margin- It is subcapsular, and comes within 0.1 cm from the overlying
capsule. The serosal surface of the gallbladder is smooth and glistening... The cystic. wall measures
0.1 cm in thickness. The mucosal surface is velvety and bile-tinged. There ismedium amount of bile,

The carcinoma is mostly invaded around the common bile duct and involves the bile ductal
mucosa. Based on the microscopic findings, this tumor is considered biliary primary,
although panlN is present.
The incidental neuroendocrine tumor is confirmed by its strong immunopositivity for
synaptophysin and chromogranin, while the surrounding adenocarcinoma is negative.

(variable, strong to moderate), HepParl (focal, weak), CD10 (focal, canalicular pattern),
and pCEA (focal, canalicular pattern).
*CLINICAL HISTORY:
Hepatitis B infection.
*COMMENT (S)
The tumor shows morphologic features of combined cholangiocarcinoma and hepatocellular
carcinoma, in roughly equal proportions.Although immunophenotype is predominantly of
cholangiocellular type, cytokeratin staining is weaker in areas of morphologic HCC, and
focal CD10/pCEA staining is present in these areas.in addition, many bile duct
hamartomas/von Meyenburg complexes (VMCs) are seen in non-neoplastic liver, as well as in
direct continuity with neoplasm (no definite in situ/dysplastic transformation of VMCS is
appreciated, however).Multiple VMCs is considered by many authors to represent a mild
form of ductal plate malformation (DPM). Likewise, there is a documented though rare
association of DPM/VMCs with cholangiocarcinoma.The significance of this finding, with
regards to potential causality for (or contribution to) neoplasia, is unclear in the
pathology literature.With regards to vascular invasion, scattered foci of tumor present
in medium-sized portal/septal type veins are identified. "" Major""venous invasion, per
AJCC/CAP definition, cannot be assessed in this specimen.

Microscopic Examination Unknown.
Special stains are performed on block A3. The reticulin stain confirms loss
of reticulin meshwork in the hepatocellular carcinoma. The tumor displays
focal pseudoglandular growth pattern. The mucicarmine stain is negative.
In the background uninvolved liver, the trichrome and the reticulin special
stains confirm the established cirrhosis. The portal tracts and the fibrous
septa. contain mild to moderate mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate. There is
mild bile ductular proliferation, but the native bile ducts are intact. The
parenchyma within regenerative nodules exhibits occasional ballooned
hepatocytes with poorly-formed Mallory bodies. Patchy pericellular sinusoidal
fibrosis is present within the regenerative nodules. The copper stain
highlights mild copper deposit in periportal/periseptal hepatocytes. The PASD
stain reveals PAS positive, diastase resistant, granules in
peri.portal/periseptal hepatocytes. The iron stain is negative.

COMMENT :The uninvolved liv er shows established cirrhosis .The presence of
steatosis ,occasional ballooned hepatocytes ,and patchy pericellular
sinusoidal fibrosis suggests steatohepatitis. The result of PASD and copper

CLINICAL INFORMATION
The patient is with a liver biopsy performed at an outside hospital which showedhepatocdllular carcinom=.The patient now undergoes right hepatic lobectomy.
GROSS DESCRIPTIONS
One appropriately labeled, formalin-filled, container is received. It contains a portion of right lobe of liver
weighing 321.2 grams and measuring 6.5 x 13.2 x 6.2 cm. cm. A small portion of tissue at the medial
side was sent for tissue procurement. The surgical margin is black. There is a 7.2 cm. (lateral to medial),
3.6 cm. (anterior to posterior), and a 5.2 cm. (superior to inferior) firm, well demarcated mass at the
lateral side of the specimen. The mass is tan/white with focal bile staining. Grossly, the mass approaches
the the capsule on the anterior, posterior, and inferior surfaces, however the capsule appears intact. The
mass is 1.5 cm. away from the surgical margin. There is also a 0.7 cm. well demarcated small nodule
adjacent at the medial site which is separate from the main mass. The remaining liver parenchyma is
unremarkable. The attached gallbladder has been previously opened. The gallbladder appears
unremarkable. No stones are identified.

LIGHT MICROSCOPY
Light microscopic examination is performed.
Sections reveal that both of the grossly identified masses are moderately differentiatedhepatocellular {carcinoma. j'he tumor cells have a cord-like distribution and display moderate nuclear atypia. The tumor
closely approaches the hepatic capsule, but does not invade through it. Apparent lymphovascular space
invasion is present within the liver in the area of the gallbladder bed. The surrounding, non-neoplastic
liver shows some bile stasis, which is predominantly intrahepatocellular. There is mild bile duct
proliferation and scattered neutrophilic aggregates within portal areas and sinusoids. These findings are
suggestive of a biliary obstruction, possibly secondary to the tumor. Also present are mild portal
lymphocytic infiltrates, consistent with a mild (Grade 1) chronic hepatitis. Viral cytopathic
effect is not noted. An iron stain shows no evidence of iron accumulation within the liver. There is no
evidence of fibrosis or cirrhosis. Small foci of macrovesicular steatosis are noted. DIAGNOSIS

GROSS DESCRIPTIONS
One appropriately labeled, formalin-filled, container is received. It holds a 362 gram, 13.5 x 10.5 x 5.0
cm. tan/gray liver lobe with an 8.0 x 7.5 x 5.0 intact tumor mass protruding from the surface. There is a
roughly spherical defect in the base of the specimen where tumor was given to tissue procurement. The
surgical margin has been inked black. The cut tumor surface demonstrates central regions of
yellow/orange necrosis and hemorrhage. The tumor appears well circumscribed and its closest distance
to the surgical margin is 1.2 cm. No other masses are identified in the hepatic parenchyma. Representative
sections are submitted as per block summary.

LIGHT MICROSCOPY
Light microscopic examination is performed.
Sections show a well circumscribed and apparently encapsulated tumor nodule composed of enlarged
hyperchromatic hepatocytes arranged predominantly in a trabecular pattern. There is both a micro-
trabecular as well as a macro-trabecular pattern. Focal pseudo-acinar structures are also
seen. There are focal areas of tumor necrosis and hemorrhage. Focal changes suspicious for
lymphovascular space invasion are observed in the capsule(section #8). There was a single nodule of
tumor without any apparent satellite lesions. The tumor appears to be well differentiated and does not
involve in the surgical margins. The adjacent liver tissue has a normal hepatitic architecture without
significant fibrosis. Steatosis was also absent.

of lung removed and concurs with the diagnostic opinion.
The portion of gallbladder removed for frozen section (FSA1) represents a gallbladder duplication cyst.
Duplication cysts are congenital malformations that can occur anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract and

Gross Description:
Received are seven appropriately labeled containers.
Container A is additionally labeled ""gallbladder mass for frozen"". Per the frozen section team the specimen
consisted of an 11 x 4 x 2.5 cm gallbladder, not previously opened, containing no stones with a pink serosal
surface. The cauterized hepatic surface is inked black. A 1.7 cm, well-circumscribed, white nodule is noted
at the gallbladder fundus, a portion of which is sampled in FSAI. The remainder of the gallbladder mucosa
is generally green/tan and velvety with occasional flecks of yellow noted on the surface. No lymph nodes
are identified. Additional sections of the fundic nodule are submitted in Al-A2 while sections of the
gallbladder mucosa at the fundus, neck and cystic duct are submitted in A3.
Container B: Per the frozen section team the specimen consisted of a 2.0 cm lymph node which is bisected.
Half of the specimen is submitted in FSA1 and the remainder in Al.
Container C is additionally labeled ""right lobectomy liver"". The specimen consists of a 1050 g, 15 x 15 x
15 cm partial hepatectomy specimen, portions of which have been sampled for frozen section and given to
Tissue Procurement. The margin of resection has been inked in black. The hepatic surface is generally
smooth and glistening with a 10.5 x 6.0 cm portion of adherent diaphragm and parietal pleura. Serial
sectioning reveals a 12 x 10 x 10 cm, fairly well-circumscribed, yellow/tan mass with large areas and
necrosis and hemorrhage noted. The mass has a vaguely nodular character along with occasional fibrous
septations noted. The mass appears to come within 0.3 cm from the inked surgical margin. The mass
appears to abut the capsule does not erode through it. The remaining hepatic parenchyma is red/brown,
smooth without fibrosis or nodularity noted. Representative sections are submitted as per the block
summary.

Container D is additionally labeled ""right portal lymph node"". It holds a 2.5 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm, roughly ovoid
lymph node with a tan homogenous cut surface. Bisected. D1 and D2
Container E is additionally labeled ""superior segment right lower lobe"". Within container E is a 3.5 x 1.5 x
1.0 cm, roughly triangular portion of gray/purple soft tissue with a stapled edge. Two fairly well
circumscribed, variegated, white/red nodules are noted in the lung parenchyma measuring 0.4 and 0.3 cm in
greatest dimension. The specimen is serially sectioned and entirely submitted.
E1 - portion of lung closest to stapled margin
E2,E3 - remaining specimen
Container F is additionally labeled ""face of right lower lobe"". Within container F is a 4.5 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm
irregular portion of purple/gray apparent lung with a 2 cm stapled edge and a 3.5 cm open edge. The pleural
surface is studded by multiple pale tan nodules measuring 0.6 cm in greatest dimension. The specimen is
entirely submitted in F1-F5 with the section closest to the stapled margin in F1.
Container G is additionally labeled ""left portal lymph node"". It holds a 2 x 1 x 0.8 cm, single, irregularly-
shaped, black/tan soft tissue fragment. G 1
Light Microscopy:
Light microscopic examination is performed.
Sections of the gallbladder show chronic cholecystitis with cholesterolosis. The cystic structure noted adjacent to gallbladder lumen and examined by frozen section is grossly unconnected to the lumen of the
gallbladder and unlike the gallbladder mucosa is not stained with bile. It consists of a round cystic structure
lined by columnar epithelium and completely surrounded by a thick smooth muscle wall. The
lining mucosa in multiple foci concentrically around the lumen penetrates the wall in a Rokatansky-
Aschoff-like pattern.. These features are consistent with a gallbladder duplication cyst. Sections of the liver
tumor show a tii atel^idifterentlated epatocellular carcinoma with large numbers of PAS-positive
alpha-l- antitrypsin inclusions. Trichrome and reticulin stains demonstrate biliary fibrosis
in the adjacent parenchyma. The iron stain is non-contributory. Tumor infiltrates the inferior surface of the
diaphragm with some destruction and fibrosis of skeletal muscle of the diaphragm. However, the
diaphragm is not penetrated by tumor.
The right lower lobe of the lung, on the immediately adjacent diaphormatic surface shows striking
mesothelial proliferation, but no tumor is identified.
The three lymph nodes submitted show reactive hyperplasia but no evidence for metastatic hepatocellular
carcinoma.

Gross Description:
Specimen A is received fresh for frozen section and is a 10 x 4 x 3 cm red/tan soft tissue fragment which
was frozen as FSAI
Specimen B is received in a formalin-filled container labeled ""liver segments 5, 8, stitch = do not mark margin upper section"" and is a 740 gram, 15.5 x 14.8 x 10.5 cm partial hepatectomy specimen. There is one
roughened cauterized surface ,which is the surgical resection surface .This surface is entirely
inked blue. At the periphery, there is a 9.3 x 4.0 cm area of exposed golden brown liver parenchyma. There
is a portion of the liver tacked down to this surface with suture materia. There is additionally suture
material in the center of this exposed parenchyma. This is believed to be the surface referenced on the
specimen container as ""do not mark margin upper section"".
L1The capsular surface is red/tan, subtly mottled with hemorrhage and remarkable for a 10 x 7.5 cm area of
subcapsular firmness .This does not appear to be a contiguous mass. Sectioning exhibits golden brown liver
parenchyma .The liver parenchyma is remarkable for at least three intraparenchymal lesions, 8 x 5 x 3
mm, 1.5 x 0.8 x 0.8 cm, and approximately 11 x 7 x 6.5 cm. These intraparenchymal lesions are each firm,
white and have well -defined to scalloped borders. The largest lesion has some areas of erythema and
hemorrhage scattered throughout. The largest lesion causes the capsular disruption noted previously.
The largest lesion has a lobulated shape and is believed to cause all of the capsular distortions . The two
smaller lesions are well within the parenchyma and not near the capsule .The smallest lesion is 4.3 cm to
the closest blue inked margin, the mid sized lesion is 4.8 cm to the closest blue inked margin and the largest
lesion is 2.1 cm to the closest blue inked margin. There are no other abnormalities readily identified within
the liver parenchyma. There is a wire mesh stent present within some of the vasculature of the liver.
Sections are submitted per the block summary.

hemorrhage and a central 7.5 x 7 x 5.5 cm stellate, firm fibrous
component. The
mass grossly abuts, but is confined by the capsular surface and
at closest
approach, is 0.3 cm from the parenchymal margin. The uninvolved
parenchyma is
yellow/tan with a nutmeg appearance and is remarkable for a 3 x
2 x 1.5 cm focus
of clustered white/pink, well-circumscribed satellite lesions.
The cluster is
located 4.0 cm from the larger mass, 1.0 cm from the parenchymal
margin, and 0.2

Grade: The grade of the tumor is not provided, but some features suggestive of higher-grade disease include trabecular architecture, plate expansion, nuclear pleomorphism, and variable nucleolar prominence.
Behavior: Malignant (hepatocellular carcinoma is a type of primary liver cancer)

The justification for these choices includes the description of a large mass in the liver with features consistent with hepatocellular carcinoma, such as a white/yellow appearance, diffuse hemorrhage, and a central fibrous component. The tumor is confined by the capsular surface but abuts it closely, and there are satellite lesions located some distance from the main mass. These features suggest that the tumor is malignant and locally advanced, although the stage cannot be determined without additional information. The grade of the tumor is also not explicitly stated in the description, but some features suggestive of higher-grade disease are mentioned.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

brown and smooth and inked blue. The opposite side is brown with
focal areas of cauterization and inked black. Sectioning reveals
brown unremarkable liver parenchyma. The specimen is entirely
submitted in block El-E6,
Light Microscopy:
Light microscopic examination is performed by Dr.
The sections show hepatocellular carcinoma involving the portal
tract margin (Bl), the surgical margin in specimen B and also
the separately submitted medial (specimen D) and anterior
margins (specimen E). The carcinoma is detached in specimen D
and uninked; therefore, the carcinoma in this specimen cannot be
oriented as to old versus new margin in specimen D. In specimen
E.the carcinoma involves both the old and the new margin.
Stains are performed on the portal tract margin (B1) and the
carcinoma in this section is positive for glypican 3 and shows
widened trabeculae by reticulin staining. The
immunohistochemistry is supportive of portal tract margin
involvement in Specimen B.
The hepatocellular carcinoma abuts capsule with an overlying
fibrous serosal adhesion, reactive mesothelial cells and
hemosiderin laden macrophages. Immunohistochemistry is performed
on the section with capsule (B4). HEPAR-l is negative within the
fibrous adhesion and calretinin highlights reactive mesothelial
cells. The carcinoma abuts capsule; but no diagnostic
involvement of capsule is identified. The hepatocellular carcinoma shows both trabecular and
pseudoglandular (acinar) architecture. Immunohistochemistry is
performed on a representative section of carcinoma (B5). HEPAR-1
stains a subset including the gland forming areas.
Glypican 3 is positive. CK7 is positive in a subset including
both the glandular and non-glandular architecture. CD5 is
negative. The findings are consistent with a hepatocellular
carcinoma with areas of pseudoglandular architecture. No
adenocarcinoma (cholangiocarcinoma or metastatic colorectal
carcinoma) is identified.
The background liver is cirrhotic with mild steatosis (< 10%,
predominately macrovesicular). No definite active
steatohepatitis is identified. Special stains are performed on
the representative uninvolved liver (B8). Reticulin and
trichrome highlight stage 4 fibrosis. Iron highlights scattered
iron within hepatocytes and mostly within Kupffer cells. PASD
stains macrophages in sinusoidal areas,and is negative for
alpha-1 antitrypsin particles.
In the cecal margin block of specimen A (A2) there is apparent
detached benign appearing liver tissue. HEPAR-1 is positive in
these detached fragments confirming liver in this section. This
may represent floater versus adhesion to liver. No carcinoma is
identified in the proximal cecal margin.

Comment:
Immunostains are performed on a section of tumor (block A5). The
malignant cells are positive for cytokeratin AE1/AE3, CK8/18,
and HepParl. MOC-31 shows patchy moderate staining. CD10 is
negative. The immunophenotype shows overlapping features between
hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma; however, given
the strong HepParl staining, a poorly differentiated
hepatocellular carcinoma is favored.
Special stains are performed on a section of background liver
(block A9). A trichrome stain shows bridging fibrosis with areas
suggestive of possible early nodule formation. There is a single
focus of minor centrilobular perisinusoidal fibrosis. A
reticulin stain shows no significant hepatic plate expansion. An
iron stain shows mild to moderately increased iron staining
within hepatocytes (grade 2 of 4) and increased iron staining
within Kupffer cells. A PAS-D stain shows no PAS positive
cytoplasmic inclusions.

Comment:
A reticulin stain confirms the presence of hepatocellular
carcinoma.
Background liver shows macrovesicular steatosis involving
approximately 30-40% of the hepatic parenchyma. Ballooned
hepatocytes containing Mallory' s hyaline are readily
identified, and moderate numbers of inflammatory cells, mainly
neutrophils, are clustered around and within lobular
hepatocytes. A trichrome stain shows patchy pericellular and
periportal fibrosis. The findings are consistent with
steatohepatitis. The presence of Mallory' s hyaline and
neutrophil-predominant lobular inflammation raises suspicion for
alcoholic steatohepatitis. Clinical correlation is recommended.
Clinical History:

Case Number:
Diagnosis:
A: Gallbladder, cholecystectomyZ-b11Yk? 1• `^
- Benign gallbladder with no significant pathologic abnormality
- No carcinoma identified
B:Liver and adherent ascending colon and retroperitoneal soft
tissue, segments 5 and 6, partial hepatectomy and en block resection
Histologic tumor type/subtype: hepatocellular carcinoma
Histologic grade: Grade 3 (Edmondson and Steiner)
Number of tumors: 1 primary lesion with multiple subcentimeter
satellite lesions
Tumor size: 11 cm
Tumor location: Segments 5 and 6
Tumor necrosis: present (involves approximately 20% of
microscopically examined tumor)
Worst tumor differentiation: grade 3 (Edmondson and Steiner)
Vascular invasion: present, macrovascular
Perineural invasion: not identified
Capsular invasion: Present
Margins: uninvolved by carcinoma; tumor is 8 mm from the closest
inked retroperitoneal soft tissue margin and 1.7 cm from the hepatic
resection margin (colonic and vascular en face margins negative for
tumor)
Lymph nodes: 11 benign lymph nodes present within pericolonic
adipose tissue (0/11)
Satellite lesions: present (multiple subcentimeter lesions)
Background liver: chronic hepatitis, etiology unknown, grade 1,
stage 2 (see comment) Other extrahepatic spread: present, tumor focally extends through
the capsule/visceral peritoneum to involve fibrous adhesions (no
microscopic evidence of tumor involvement within underlying colon
and soft tissue)
Additional findings:
- Eleven benign colonic lymph nodes (0/11)
AJCC Pathologic TNM stage :pT4 pNx
NOTE: This pathologic stage assessment is based on information
available at the time of this report, and is subject to change
pending clinical review and additional information.
C: Bowel, ileum, resection
- Benign small bowel with fibrous serosal adhesions, acute
serositis, and serosal hemorrhage with hemosiderin laden macrophages
- No carcinoma identified
Comment:
Microscopic examination of non-neoplastic liver reveals fibrotic
portal tracts with mild bile ductular proliferation and an
associated chronic lymphocytic infiltrate consisting almost entirely
of lymphocytes. No prominent plasma cell infiltrate is identified.
No piecemeal necrosis is identified. There is mixed macrovesicular
and microvesicular steatosis involving less than 5% of the hepatic
parenchyma and no features are present to suggest involvement by
steatohepatitis.
A trichrome stain highlights areas of periportal fibrosis with no
evidence of bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis. A reticulin stain also
highlights periportal fibrosis but shows an otherwise normal hepatic
plate thickness. A DPAS stain shows no evidence of alpha-l-
antitrypsin deficiency (no DPAS positive globules identified within
hepatocytes). An iron stain shows a mild increase in hepatic
iron (grade 1 of 4). The findings are consistent with chronic
hepatitis, grade 1, stage 2. The differential diagnosis includes
viral hepatitis and autoimmune hepatitis. Correlation with clinical
history and laboratory studies is recommended to determine the
etiology of the chronic hepatitis.
Clinical History:
The patient is a -year-old female with a clinical diagnosis of
HCC. Gross Description:
Specimen A is received with one appropriately labeled container
additionally labeled ""gallbladder"".
Previously opened or disrupted: No
Measurements: 4.6 x 3.1 x 0.9 cm
External surface: Yellow/green, smooth and glistening
Luminal contents: Green viscous fluid
Stones present: No
Mucosa: Green and velvety
Wall thickness: 1 mm
Other comments: No
Block #: Al - Cystic duct margin and representative section
Tissue remains in formalin.
Specimen B is received in formalin appropriately labeled ""segments 5
and 6"".
Specimen Type: Segmentectomy and right hemicolectomy
Specimen Weight: 745 grams
Measurement: 12.5 x 11 x 7 cm segment of liver with attached right
hemicolectomy consisting of 3 cm of terminal ileum and 14 cm of
cecum and ascending colon.
Orientation: Anatomical. The liver resection margin is inked blue.
Capsule: There is a 14.5 cm yellow bulging defect with adherent
mesenteric fat and colon. Where the tumor is adherent to the
mesentery, the surface margin is inked green. The remainder of the
capsule is tan/brown and smooth. Beneath the capsular defect there
is an 11 x 9 x 6.5 cm white to tan nodular partially
circumscribed mass with multiple adjacent budding nodules.
Mass:Further sectioning reveals a blood vessel that is plugged
with tumor thrombus. Additionally, the mass extends through the
capsule to within 1.1 cm of the green inked mesenteric margin. Where
the mass is adherent to the bowel, it appears to extend to but not
grossly invade the capsule. The tumor is 1.7 cm from the blue inked
hepatic resection margin, and widely free of the distal margin.
Adjacent liver tissue: Tan/brown and unremarkable.
The colonic mucosa is pink/tan with normal folding.
The appendix is surgically absent.
Major portal vein/ hepatic vein:
Gallbladder: See specimen A.

Container C is additionally labeled ""ileum."" It holds a 6 cm in
length x 2.1 cm in diameter segment of small bowel. There is a 2.5 x
1.8 cm area of hemorrhagic adhesions 0.5 cm from the closest mucosal
margin. The serosal surface is pink/tan and smooth. Opening reveals
pink/tan mucosa with normal folding. Beneath the hemorrhagic
adhesions, the cut surface is yellow fat.

Block 3A, microdissection target 1 (TI):
A. Lose of heterozygosity is IDENTIFIED at chromosomeSq (371).B. Fractional Allelic Lose is 8%(1 locus with lo8e /12 informative loci). Block48, microdissectiontarget 2 (T2):
A. Lose of heterozygosity is IDEN'i'T.FIED at chromosome lp (321).B. Fractional Allelic Loss is 8%(1 locus with loss/12 informative loci).
Note;
LON of high amplitudeis considered when more than 75% of cellular DNA is affected.
Loss of heterozygosity of tumor suppressor gene alleles is knownto occur inliver neoplaeias and to correlate with tumor progression. As reported in theliterature, benign neoplasms (hepatic adenoma and focal nodular hyperplasia)typically have low frequency of LOH (mean tractional allelic lose -61) and hepatocellular carcinomas (BCC) frequently have higher prevalence of LOX (meanfractional allele loss -301) (1,2). Some studies have shown that MCC with
PAL of 430% are associated with indolent biological behavior and PAL of >30%with an aggressive biological behavior (3-5). LOU mutations are reported ashigh amplitude when more than 754 of cellular DNA is affected.Some HCC with low amplitude LOX mutations and PAL 25 -35 4 considered to be indeterminatebiological behavior .However,not all tumors reveal such a correlation and,therefore , the LOH profileshould be interpreted in the context of thecytologicand histologic findings and the patient'a clinical history.Sample Preparation and LOH Analysis
Manual microdissection of the tissue sample was performed to include tumor
tissue and normal adjacent tissue if available)or a blood sample. DNA wasisolated using standard laboratory procedure.Specimens with the minimum of
S0% of tumor cells in a microdisseetion target are accepted for the analysis.
Optical density readings were obtained.
Eighteen microsatellite markers (listed below )that have been previously foundto be involved in liver neoplasia and/or co-localize with known tumor
suppressor genes were used for analysis.FCR was performed using
fluorescently labeled primers and the products of amplification were detected
using capillary electrophoresis on A613730 platform .Relative fluorescence was
determined for individual alleles and the ratio of peaks was calculated
. Normal tissue was examined to determine whether the
patient is heterozygous at the marker (genetically informative )and neoplactic
tissue was then analyzed to detect lose of heterozygosity .Thresholds for
significant allelic imbalance were determined using normal(non-neoplastic)
specimens for every marker .Loss of heterozygosity was determined using (NL /Na)! (TL /TS) formula and reported when allelic ratio for a particular marker
was below 0.5 or above 2.0. when normal tissue was not available ,peak height
ratios falling outside of 2 We beyond the mean for each polymorphic allele
iparngwere assessed asshowing lose of heterozygosity.

oat. Reviewed"," Based on the given text, here are the answers for the six categories:

Site: The site of the tumor is not explicitly mentioned in the text, but it can be inferred that it is a liver neoplasia since the markers used for analysis have been previously found to be involved in liver neoplasia.

Laterality: Laterality is also not provided in the text.

Histology: The histology of the tumor is not explicitly stated, but based on the context, it can be assumed that it is either hepatic adenoma or hepatocellular carcinoma since these are the types of liver neoplasia mentioned in the text.

Stage: The stage of the tumor is not provided in the text.

Grade: The grade of the tumor is not explicitly stated, but the text mentions PAL (proliferation index) which can be used to determine the grade of the tumor. However, specific values for PAL are not given.

Behavior: Based on the PAL values mentioned in the text, it can be inferred that the tumor with a PAL of 430% or more has an aggressive biological behavior, and a PAL between 25-35% is considered indeterminate for biological behavior. However, specific information about the tumor's behavior is not provided.

Therefore, the answers are:

Site: Liver neoplasia (inferred)
Laterality: Not provided
Histology: Hepatic adenoma or hepatocellular carcinoma (inferred)
Stage: Not provided
Grade: Not explicitly stated
Behavior: Indeterminate or aggressive (based on PAL values, but not specifically mentioned for this tumor).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prior MalignancyPAGE 3"," Site: The primary tumor is in the liver, as indicated by the specimen description and synoptic report.

Laterality: The laterality is not explicitly mentioned in the text, but since a right hepatectomy was performed, it can be inferred that the tumor originated from the right lobe of the liver.

Histology: The histologic type is hepatocellular carcinoma, as stated in the synoptic report.

Stage: The pTNM stage is pT2 pNO pM1 (Stage IVB). This indicates that the tumor has grown into a major branch of the liver's blood supply but has not invaded adjacent organs or structures. There are no cancerous lymph nodes, and distant metastasis is present.

Grade: The histologic grade is poorly differentiated (Grade 3 of 4, Edmondson and Steiner), as mentioned in the synoptic report.

Behavior: The behavior of this tumor is malignant, given its histology, size, and stage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OTHER SPECIAL CONSULTATION: TCGA PROJECT
A.The specimen is submitted fresh as ""liver segment V and VI"" and
consists of a section of liver weighing 421 grams and measuring 14 x 11 x
8an.The external surface is red brown having a slight nodular
appearance. The surgical margin will be marked with black dye.
Sectioning reveals the normal nutmeg color interrupted by a friable tan
lobulated mass measuring 7 x 4.5 x 4.5 an. The mass appears to be well
circumscribed and encapsulated and approaches to within 1.5 an of the
surgical margin and 0.5 cm to the external surface. Representative
sections are submitted, 10 (7).
B.The specimen is submitted in formalin as ""gallbladder"" and consists of
a gallbladder measuring 7 x 3 x 1.3 cm. The external surface is pale
yellow to purple tan. Upon opening the gallbladder contains a scant of
dark green bile.Calculi are not grossly identified. The gallbladder
wall measures 0.2 cm in thickness. The mucosa is dark green and
trabeculated.The resected margin of the cystic duct does not grossly
appear to be dilated and not occluded. Representative sections are
submitted, 3 M.

R^"," Site: The site of the pathology is not explicitly mentioned in the form, but it can be inferred that it is related to a gynecological condition as there is an extensive obstetrical and gynecological history provided.

Laterality: Laterality is not provided or inferable from the information given in the form.

Histology: The histological diagnosis suggests adenocarcinoma, but more specific information about the type of adenocarcinoma is not provided.

Stage: The TNM stage is not explicitly mentioned; however, there are details about the primary tumor and lymph nodes that could be used to determine the stage.

Grade: The grade of the tumor is not explicitly stated in the form. However, there is some information about nuclear features that might help a pathologist determine the grade.

Behavior: The behavior of this lesion is assumed to be malignant based on the context and the histological diagnosis of adenocarcinoma.

The information provided is not sufficient for a complete pathology report, as important details such as the exact site, laterality, stage, grade, and behavior are missing or unclear.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

*(INTEG)tATEDRE,AORT OF FINDINGS BY"," Site: The specimen is from the breast, as indicated by the focus on primary tumor in the breast and associated lymph nodes.

Laterality: Not provided, as there is no information given about the location of the tumor within the breast.

Histology: Infiltrating ductal carcinoma, as suggested by the diffuse growth pattern, cell distribution, and structural patterns present in the microscopic description.

Stage: pT3 No Mo, indicating a significant primary tumor (>5 cm) without evidence of regional lymph node or distant metastasis.

Grade: Not explicitly stated, but the presence of necrosis, high mitotic activity, and poor cellular differentiation suggest a higher grade lesion.

Behavior: Malignant, given the infiltrating nature of the tumor and the absence of any information suggesting otherwise. The justification for these categories is based on the provided pathology report, with a focus on the microscopic description and the pTNM staging.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Date"," Based on the data provided, here is the information for the requested categories:

Site: The primary tumor site is not explicitly mentioned in the data, but it can be inferred that it may be related to the breast based on the mention of ""Hormone Replacement Therapy"" and various breast cancer-related tests such as ""CEA,"" ""CA 15-3,"" ""CA 19-9,"" and ""PSA."" However, this is not definitive.

Laterality: Not provided.

Histology: The histological diagnosis is not explicitly stated in the data, but there are several clues that suggest a malignant epithelial tumor, such as the mention of ""Hormone Replacement Therapy,"" various breast cancer-related tests, and pathological findings like ""Diffuse Necrosis"" and ""Vascular Invasion."" However, this is not definitive.

Stage: The stage is not explicitly mentioned in the data, but there are several clues that suggest a later stage based on the mention of various imaging studies such as ""Ultrasound X,"" ""X-Ray,"" ""CT,"" and ""MRI,"" as well as the mention of ""Surgical Treatment"" and ""Neoadjuvant Therapy."" However, this is not definitive.

Grade: The grade is not explicitly mentioned in the data.

Behavior: Based on the various clues, it can be inferred that the tumor behavior is malignant. However, this is not definitive.

Justification: The justification for these categories is based on the available data and the various clues that suggest a malignant epithelial tumor, likely related to the breast, at a later stage, with a high grade and malignant behavior. However, it's important to note that this interpretation may not be accurate without further information.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Laterality: Not provided.

Histology: The histological diagnosis is adenocarcinoma based on the mention of ""Glandular cell"" and ""Cellular Differentiation: Glandular.""

Stage: The stage appears to be T3 N1 M0, based on the given information.

Grade: The nuclear grade is not explicitly mentioned, but hyperchromatism, nucleolar prominence, multinucleated giant cells, and mitotic activity suggest a high-grade tumor.

Behavior: Pancreatic adenocarcinoma typically behaves as a malignant neoplasm with poor prognosis.

1. Site: The primary tumor location is not explicitly mentioned in the given report; however, it can be inferred to be in the pancreas based on the surgical procedure and other diagnostic studies.
2. Laterality: Not provided in the report.
3. Histology: The histological diagnosis is adenocarcinoma, as stated in the ""Histological Diagnosis"" section of the report.
4. Stage: The pathological stage is pT3 No M0, which indicates that the tumor has grown into the surrounding tissues but has not spread to distant sites or lymph nodes.
5. Grade: The grade of the tumor is not explicitly mentioned in the report; however, it can be inferred to be moderately differentiated based on the description ""moderately well-differentiated adenocarcinoma"" found in the IRS Approval section.
6. Behavior: The behavior of this tumor is malignant, as it is an invasive cancer that can spread to other parts of the body.

14"," Based on the given replacement therapy social history and lab data, here are the six categories with my choices and justifications:

1. Site: Lung, as the smoking history and positive AFP test result suggest a possible primary lung tumor. However, it is not explicitly stated in the document.
2. Laterality: Not provided, as there is no information about the location or side of the tumor.
3. Histology: Adenocarcinoma, as the positive AFP test result suggests a hepatocellular carcinoma, which is a type of adenocarcinoma. However, it is not explicitly stated in the document.
4. Stage: Not provided, as there is no information about the size or extent of the tumor.
5. Grade: Not provided, as there is no information about the differentiation or aggressiveness of the tumor.

t"," Based on the given clinical history and pathological report, here are the six categories with one-sentence justifications:

1. Site: The primary tumor is located in the lung, as indicated by the surgical treatment details and the final pathology report.
2. Laterality: Not provided in the information given.
3. Histology: The tumor is a carcinoma with adenoid cell and spindle cell features, as described in the final pathology report.
4. Stage: The patient was diagnosed with T2aN1M0 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), based on clinical staging and TNM classification.
5. Grade: Not explicitly stated in the given information, but the high nuclear grade suggests a more aggressive behavior.
6. Behavior: The tumor is malignant, as indicated by the final pathology report and the need for surgical treatment.

Overall, the site, histology, stage, and behavior of this lung tumor suggest an aggressive malignancy requiring prompt and thorough treatment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Site: Not explicitly provided, but can be inferred to be the prostate based on the mentioned tests and treatments.

Laterality: Not provided, as no information about the spread of the cancer suggests it is limited to one side of the prostate.

Histology: Adenocarcinoma, not otherwise specified (NOS), as this is a common type of prostate cancer.

Stage: T3 N0 M0, meaning the tumor has grown beyond the prostate but has not yet spread to nearby lymph nodes or distant sites.

Grade: Not explicitly provided, but it can be inferred that the grade is likely higher than 1 due to the need for treatment.

Behavior: Malignant, as this is a cancer diagnosis.

Justification: The given information includes tests and treatments specific to prostate cancer, such as PSA levels, biopsy results, and surgical procedures on the prostate gland.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2. ""Laterality"": Not provided, as the information is not relevant for rectal tumors which are typically located in the lower part of the body.
3. ""Histology"": The histological type of the tumor is adenocarcinoma - this is stated in the 'Pathological Description' section where it mentions ""SOUNWH ON GbndularadN*MCdSaaftetlon"".
4. ""Stage"": Based on the surgical treatment and pathological staging sections, the tumor appears to be at least pT3 N1 M0 stage (invasive tumor with metastasis in 1 to 3 pericolic or perirectal lymph nodes but no distant metastasis).
5. ""Grade"": Not provided, as the report does not include information about the differentiation level of the cancer cells.

1. Site: Not provided
2. Laterality: Not provided
3. Histology: The patient has a positive HepC test result, indicating liver disease, but the specific histological diagnosis is not provided.
4. Stage: The clinical staging is T2N0M0, which means that the primary tumor is 5 cm or less in size and has not spread to nearby lymph nodes or distant organs. However, the detailed location, size, and type of the tumor are not provided.
5. Grade: The grade of the tumor is not provided, making it difficult to assess its aggressiveness and potential for metastasis.
6. Behavior: Not provided

Justification: The site and laterality of the tumor are crucial for determining the appropriate treatment plan and prognosis. Histology provides information about the type and characteristics of the tumor, which is essential for selecting the most effective therapy. Stage, grade, and behavior are also important factors that influence the patient's outcome and response to treatment. Therefore, it is necessary to have complete and accurate information in these six categories to make informed clinical decisions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Primary Tumor Site Discrepancy

Prior Malignancy History
Dual/Synckropous Primary"," Based on the given medical report, here are the relevant categories with some information or ""not provided"" when missing:

1. Site: The primary tumor site is not explicitly mentioned but suspected involved lymph nodes and other details suggest a possible gastrointestinal location.
2. Laterality: Not provided, as the report does not specify whether the tumor affected one side or was bilateral.
3. Histology: Adenocarcinoma, based on the mention of CEA, CA 19-9, and other tumor markers.
4. Stage: The TNM staging suggests a locally advanced cancer (T3 N0 M0), but the final pathological stage is not provided.
5. Grade: Not provided, as the report does not include information about the differentiation or growth rate of the cancer cells.
6. Behavior: Malignant, as it is a cancer diagnosis with potential for invasion and metastasis.

Justification: The choice of these categories is based on the available information in the medical report, which includes various tests, imaging results, and treatment recommendations suggestive of a gastrointestinal adenocarcinoma. However, some key details such as laterality, stage, and grade are not explicitly stated, making it challenging to provide definitive answers for those categories.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

cm), omentum biopsy (2 pieces 2.6 x 0 .8 x 0.5 cm) and hepatic artery
lymph node.
DIAGNOSIS:
Liver and gallbladder, resection: Grade 3_of 4, hepatocellular
carcinoma, usual type, forming a hilarmass4.8 x 4.3 x 3.2 cm
involving segments V and VIII abutting the gallbladder, but no
involving it. The hepatic capsule is free of tumor. The surgical
margins are free of tumor, the clearance being 0.7 cm
microscopically. Angiolymphatic invasion is identified (by VVG
stain) within the tumor however, extratumoral vascular invasion is
not identified. The tumor is partially encapsulated, infiltration
of parenchyma being of the pushing type. The adjacent liver
parenchyma is non-cirrhotic. The gallbladder shows subacute and
chronic cholecystitis with cholelithiasis (3 mixed stones). All
surgical margins are free of tumor, closest 0.7 cm.
Imniunoperoxidase studies were performed on paraffin sections of the
liver mass using antibodies directed against the following antigens:
Hep-1, pCEA, keratin, TTF-1, CD10, mucicarmine, albumin ISH, and
VVG.The tumor cells are positive for albumin RNA by ISH with
patchy strong staining for keratin, Hep-1 with focal focal
canalicular pCEA positivity, and patchy cytoplasmic TTF-1
positivity. The tumor cells are negative for CD10 and mucicarmine.
These findings support the H.E diagnosis.
Omentum, biopsy: Fat necrosis negative for malignancy.
Lymphnode,hepatic artery ,excision :A single hepatic artery lymph
node is negative for tumor.

The site is specified as the liver, which is the organ where the tumor is located.

Laterality: Not provided
The laterality is not provided in the description, as it is not relevant for a tumor that is located in the liver.

Histology: Hepatocellular carcinoma
The histologic type of the tumor is hepatocellular carcinoma, which is the most common type of primary liver cancer.

Stage: pT2NX
The pathologic staging indicates that the primary tumor is solitary or multiple with vascular invasion and no regional lymph node metastasis has been identified. However, the number of lymph nodes examined is not provided.

Grade: GII
The histologic grade of the tumor is moderately differentiated, which suggests an intermediate level of aggressiveness.

Behavior: Malignant
The behavior of the tumor is malignant, as it is a cancer that can invade surrounding tissues and metastasize to other organs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Justification: The procedure involves a liver resection specimen, and the pathology report contains details about the liver tumor.

Laterality: Right
Justification: The report mentions a right lobectomy, indicating that the resection was performed on the right lobe of the liver.

Histology: Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Justification: The pathology report confirms the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma based on the gross and microscopic findings, as well as special stains.

Stage: pT2
Justification: The primary tumor was solitary with vascular invasion or multiple tumors, none more than 5 cm, which corresponds to pT2 in the pTNM staging system.

Grade: Not provided
Justification: Although the report contains information about the histologic type and stage, it does not provide a grade for the tumor.

Behavior: Malignant
Justification: The diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma indicates that the tumor is malignant, as it has the potential to invade surrounding tissues and metastasize to other organs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

liver"" is a fragment of liver measuring 3.0 x 1.4 x 1.0 cm. The
specimen is a wedge resection and triangular in shape. There is
cautery artifact on one side, the capsule is smooth and without
abnormalities on another surface, and the cut surface is golden
yellow. The specimen is serially sectioned and submitted in
cassettes Al and A2.
DIAGNOSIS:
Liver, segment 4A, wedge biopsy: Fatty liver disease
characterized by marked steatosis, mildly active (grade 1 of 3)

DIAGNOSIS COMMENT:
This is a large wedge biopsy with numerous portal tracts,
although the cytology is distorted by moderate to marked cautery
artifact. Portal areas show intact bile ducts with mild
nonspecific lymphocytic inflammation and several bile duct
hamartomas (von Meyenburg complexes). Acinar parenchyma shows
marked, nearly panacinar, steatosis that is accompanied by only
rare ballooned hepatocytes and very spotty lymphohistiocytic
infiltrates. There is no well-formed Mallory's hyaline. Iron
and PAS-D stains are negative. Trichrome and reticulin stains
show only slight zone 3 fibrosis, but fairly extensive
periportal fibrosis and a rare portal-portal bridge. There is
no evidence of extensive fibrosis or cirrhosis.

His,o necrotizing portal and lobular granulomas are al so seen (see
comment).
Comment: The section of non-neoplastic liver contains
numerous portal tracts for evaluation. Many of these contain
mild to moderate lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrates. Some
also contain granulomatous inflammation. The latter does not
appear to be directed at bile ducts. There is no significant
interface activity. The lobular parenchyma demonstrates severe,
predominantly
macrovesicular steatosis. Lobular inflammation, occasional
neutrophils, occasional microgranulomas, and hepatocyte
ballooning are seen. A trichrome stain confirms the presence of
periportal and focal bridging fibrosis. The iron stain is
negative for hemosiderosis.
Results of GMS and Auramine-rhodamine stains will be reported
as an addendum. Given the clinical scenario, the granulomatous
inflammation may represent reaction to the patient's neoplasm.
Clinical correlation is needed.
ADDENDUM:
Sperial stains for microorganisms (AR and GMS) are negative.
AMENDMENTS: Revision Description: Amended to include non-
neoplastic liver component in final diagnosis.
....Original Diagnosis....

x 3.0 x 2.2 cm) together weighing 1590.0 grams.
DIAGNOSIS:
Liver, right lobe with gallbladderesection: Grade 2 (of 4)
well-differentiated hepatocellular3carcinoma forming a tan-
green nodular, poorly circumscribed ""solitary mass (14.2 x 12.0 x
11.8 cm). The tumor is partially encapsulated and shows a broad
pushing-type border with the adjacent non-neoplastic parenchyma.
No satellite masses are identified. No large vein invasion is
identified. The tumor extends up to but does not involve the
gallbladder muscular wall. All surgical resection margins are
negative for tumor (minimum tumor free margin, 0.3 cm). The
gallbladder mucosa is unremarkable. The non-neoplastic liver
will be reviewed on permanent sections and will be reported in
an addendum.
ADDENDUM:
The permanent sections of the non-neoplastic liver are
reviewed. The portal areas present show only minimal patchy non-
specific inflammation. Numerous portal areas are totally
unremarkable. The interlobular bile ducts are intact and show
no significant cellular injury. No significant ductular
proliferation is identified. The hepatic lobular parenchyma is
essentially unremarkable. No significant steatosis is
identified. No significant necroinflammatory activity is noted.
Apoptotic hepatocytes are inconspicuous. The PAS stain after
diastase digestion demonstrates no significant cytoplasmic
globular inclusions within hepatocytes. The iron stain
demonstrates no significant iron accumulation within
hepatocytes or Kupffer cells. The trichrome stain highlights
the portal areas and demonstrates no significant portal tract
expansion by fibrosis and specifically no periportal or
pericellular fibrosis is identified.

The site is specified as the right lobe of the liver, where the tumor was resected.

Laterality: Right
The laterality is specified as right, corresponding to the location of the liver lobe.

Histology: Hepatocellular Carcinoma
The histological type is hepatocellular carcinoma, which is a primary malignant tumor originating from hepatocytes.

Stage: pT2 (based on available information)
The stage is not explicitly provided; however, based on the given information about the solitary tumor with vascular invasion but no lymph node or distant metastasis, it can be tentatively classified as pT2.

Grade: Grade 2 of 4 (Moderately Differentiated)
The tumor is described as a grade 2 hepatocellular carcinoma, which means it is moderately differentiated.

Behavior: Malignant
The behavior of the tumor is malignant, as it is a cancerous growth with the potential to invade surrounding tissues and metastasize to other organs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DIAGNOSIS:
Liver, mass ,serpent VI resection :Moderately differentiated
hepatocellular carcinoma ,forming a variegated mass with focal
necrosis measuring 14.5 x 13.0 x 12.0 cm. The tumor is partially
encapsulated with pushing border ,and it shows no large vessel
invasion .The margins of resection are negative for neoplasm
(closest tumor free margin ,0.7 cm).The morphological findings
in the adjacent non-neoplastic liver parenchyma willbe reported

Immunoperoxidase stains show the tumor cells to be positive for
polyclonal CEA and Hep-1, and negative for AFP and cytokeratin
7. These findings support the above diagnosis.
Liver, mass, segment VII resection: Hepatocellular carcinoma
forming a solid nodule (1.3 x 1.0 x 0.9 cm), located 0.2 cm
from the surgical margin of resection. A separate nodule,
representing a cavernous hemangioma (1.2 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm) is also
identified.

DIAGNOSIS:
Right lobe liver, resection: Grade 2 hepatocellular carcinoma is identified forming
a well-circumscribed mass (8 x 6 x 6 cm) in the right lobe of the liver. The closest
surgical resection margin is at a distance of 2 mm. The margins of resection are free
of involvement.
Gallbladder, excision: Mild chronic cholecystitis.
Pericholedochal lymph node, excision: Single inflammatory lymph node identified.
Paraffin section immunostains show neoplastic cells are positive for CAM 5.2,
vimentin, and alpha fetoprotein, while they are negative for p-CEA, S-100, and actin.
In situ hybridization for albumin mRNA is weakly positive. These results support
the diagnosis of hepatoma. HMB-45 immunostain, however, is also positive in
neoplastic cells; the meaning of this staining reactivity is unclear.

DIAGNOSIS:
Liver, Segments I, 11, III and IV, resection: Grade 3 (of 4) hepatocellular carcinoma,
usual type, forming a single 18.5 x 18 x 11 cm mass. The tumor is located in
Segments 1, II, 111 and IV. The tumor invades into but not through hepatic capsule.
The tumor closely approaches the surgical margin (less than 1 mm) which
microscopically is uninvolved. Vascular invasion is identified, involving hepatic
veins microscopically. The tumor is not encapsulated. The
approximate percent of tumor necrosis is 30%. The non neoplastic liver will be
assessed on permanent sections and an addendum will be issued.
Lymph node, left portal, excision: A single benign lymph node is identified.
Gallbladder, cholecystectomy: Chronic cholecystitis and cholelithiasis, a single
pigment
stone (0.4 cm). An adenomyoma (1.0 cm) is identified. Multiple (3) cystic duct
lymph nodes
are negative for tumor.
ADDENDUM:
The normal liver shows a mild nonspecific chronic inflammatory infiltrate in the
portal tracts
but is otherwise unremarkable. Special stains show minimal amounts of hepatic
iron of
doubtful clinical significance. A PAS-D is unremarkable. (Seen with Doctor

DIAGNOSIS:
A. Gallbladder, cholecystectomy: Acute and chronic cholecystitis
and cholelithiasis. A single (1) cystic duct reactive lymph node.
B.Liver, segment IVa, biopsy: Focus of atypical hepatocytes with
architectural cribriforming, consistent with hepatocellular
carcinoma arising in a background of steatohepatitis (these features
are best seenon the frozen section slide).
C.Liver, segment II, biopsy: Subcapsular lipoma (0.5 cm). The
underlying liver parenchyma shows marked steatohepatitis.
D. Liver, left hepatectomy: Grade 1 - 2 (of 4) hepatocellular
carcinoma, forming a well-defined, lobulated and hemorrhagic
dominant mass(4.8 x 4.2 x 3.7 cm) with biopsy effect in segment IVb
of the liver. Situated roughly 5 cm superior to this tumor, in
segment IVa (clinical), is a second nodule of grade 1 - 2 (of 4)
hepatocellular carcinoma that is much less distinct grossly with an
estimated greatest linear extent of about 1.5 cm. This tumor also
displays needle tract effect (see part B above). Near the end of
segment II is a cautery defect status-post wedge biopsy (see part C
above). The background liver shows gross and microscopic evidence
of steatohepatitis without cirrhosis. Random sections of background
liver evaluated microscopically show ""clonal"" expansions of
hepatocytes with some architectural and cytologic atypia best viewed
as physiologic in nature. There are also many bile duct hamartomas
identified grossly and microscopically ranging in size from 0.2 cm
to 0.5 cm in greatest dimension. The margins of resection are
negative for malignancy (closest tumor free margin estimated at
roughly 0.5 cm from the smaller cancer in segment IVa).

TISSUE DESCRIPTION:
Al A2 A3 A4 A5 A6 A7 A8 A9 A10 All Bl
Tissue from liver segments II and III (aggregating 163.0 grams, 12.8
x 9.2 x 6.8 cm), tissue from liver new margin (7.8 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm).
DIAGNOSIS:
Liver, segments II and III and new margin, excisions:
Well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma forming a 3.2 x 2.8 x
2.2 cm well-circumscribed but unencapsulated mass.No vascular
invasion seen. Surgical resection margins, after a single
re-excision are negative for tumor.
ADDENDUM:
The surrounding non-neoplastic liver shows mild, nonspecific portal
inflammation with no advanced fibrosis (see comment).
ADDENDUM COMMENT:
A minority of portal tracts contain a mixed inflammatory infiltrate
consisting of lymphocytes with rare plasma cells and occasional
neutrophils. The latter appear to be associated with patchy
ductular proliferation. Interlobular bile ducts are intact. A
solitary portal-based granulomatous reaction is seen. The lobular
parenchyma demonstrates surgical hepatitis with trace steatosis but
no active steatohepatitis. There is no significant fibrosis.

DIAGNOSI S :
A.Liver, segments II and III, partial hepatectomy: Hepatocellular
carcinoma, well differentiated (grade 1 of 4), forming a dominant,
14.5 x 10.5 x 10.0 cm mass with multiple satellite masses (see parts
C,E,F).The tumor is confined to the liver. The resection margin
is negative for tumor (tumor free margin, 0.5 cm). Macroscopic
large vessel (venous) invasion is absent. Microscopic (small
vessel) invasion is absent. No regional lymph nodes are identified.
The surrounding non-neoplastic hepatic parenchyma shows no
significant diagnostic abnormality (see comment).
Pathologic staging based on available surgical pathology material
(AJCC 7th edition): •pT3a.
Comment: The sections of the large mass present in segments II and
III (part A) demonstrate a well differentiated neoplasm with bland
cytology that shows loss of the normal reticulin network and
dispersion of the neoplastic cells by an intercellular material
suggestive of mucin. The reticulin network is preserved in the
surrounding liver parenchyma. A glypican 3 stain is negative in the
neoplastic cells and is noncontributory. The separately submitted
wedge resections from segment VI, segment VIII, and segment IVB show
smaller nodules with similar histologic features. No defined lesion
is identified in the liver segment VII.
The overall features including loss of the reticulin network and the
multifocality suggest, although the cytologic features are bland and
well differentiated, that this represents a well differentiated
hepatocellular carcinoma.
Case seen with
Additional reticulin stains will be performed on parts C and E as
well as a mucicarmine stain performed on part A. These stains will
be reported in an addendum, when available.
B.Gallbladder, cholecystectomy: Mild chronic cholecystitis.
C.Liver, segment VI, resection: Well differentiated
hepatocellular carcinoma, forming a 1.2 x 1.1 x 0.8 cm nodule, 0.9
cm from the surgical resection margin.
D.Liver, segment VII, resection: Hepatic tissue with cautery
effect. No definitive lesion is identified.
E.Liver, segment VIII, resection: Well differentiated
hepatocellular carcinoma, forming a 1.0 x 1.0 x 0.9 cm nodule, 0.1
cm from the surgical resection margin.
F.Liver, segment IVB, resection: Well differentiated
hepatocellular carcinoma, forming a 1.1 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm nodule,
abutting the inked surgical resection margin.

III IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII ADDENDUM:
Reticulin stains are performed on two of the satellite nodules
(blocks Cl and E1). The stains show convincing loss of the
reticulin framework in both nodules, adding further support for the
diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma with multiple satellite
nodules.
Given the mucinous character of the cut tumor surface, a mucicarmine
stain is performed on a representative tumor block (A2). There is a
faint pink blush in the dilated sinusoids, but no intracellular
mucin is identified. Some hepatocellular carcinomas can overexpress
mucin-related proteins (particularly MUC1); that could possibly
account for both the gross and histochemical findings.

CLINICAL NOTES
PRE-OP DIAGNOSIS: Hepatic cancer.
FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS
A. Right lobe of liver, partial resection: Tumor at margin.
B. Right lobe of liver, additional margin: Margin negative
(superior).
GROSS DESCRIPTION
A. The specimen is received fresh for frozen section and
tissue procurement labeled ""right lobe of liver"" and
consists of a 493 gram, 14.0 x 11.0 x 5.5 cm. partial hepatectomy
specimen described as ""right lobe"". The cauterized parenchymal
margin measures 13.0 x 6.2 cm. There is a large obvious gross tumor
mass opposite to that margin. A double suture is present at one
aspect and a frozen section of that area is requested. The
parenchymal margin is inked black; a fleshy yellow to tan nodular
irregular area consisting of tumor mass which measures 9.0 x 12.0 x
6.0 cm. Abutting.this mass are other irregular tumor nodules which
measure a combined 3 cm. in greatest dimension. Separate from the
largest mass is a 2 cm. nodule which is present directly at the
suture which was requested for frozen section. A representative
section of that margin with attached tissue is submitted for frozen
section as frozen section AFS-1. Representative sections of tumor
and normal are submitted for tissue procurement. Representative
sections are submitted in 10 blocks as labeled.
BLOCK SUMMARY: 1-3 - Tumor to inked resection margin; 4-6 - tumor
to capsular surface; 7-9 - tumor to normal parenchyma; 10 - random
normal parenchyma.
Please note, photographs are taken.
B. Received fresh labeled ""additional lobe of liver"" is a
670 gram, 14.0 x 4.0 x 4.5 cm. hepatectomy specimen with a
double long suture oriented as superior and a single long stitch
oriented as anterior which is hepatic capsular surface. The double
long stitch margin is inked black and the inferior side is inked red
for orientation. That inferior side represents the tissue adjacent
to specimen A. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal pale
tannish areas adjacent to the prior resection which may represent
residual tumor. The area adjacent to the single long stitch
designated anterior is inked orange. The superior margin is sampled
in frozen sections 1 and 2 and the area adjacent to the stitch
defined as anterior margin which appeared more capsular is submitted as representative frozen section AFS3. Representative sections
after fixation. RS8. Representative sections are submitted for
frozen section with blocks BFS1 and BFS2 representing the new
superior margin and BFS3 representing the ""single stitch anterior
margin"" which appears to be hepatic capsule. Representative
sections are submitted in eight blocks as labeled.
BLOCK SUMMARY: 1-3 - Remainder of anterior margin (subsequently
inked orange); 4-8 - representative from remainder of specimen
documenting surfaces subsequently inked red (portion previously
contiguous with part A) and black (apparent cauterized resection
margin). RR1-5 additional sections contiguous with part A.
A&B. Microscopic examination of the right lobe of liver partial
hepatectomy:
Histologic type: Hepatocellular carcinoma with solid, trabecular and
clear cell patterns.
Histologic grade: Grade 3 of 4.
Tumor size: The main tumor mass is 12 cm. in greatest dimension and
abutting additional irregular tumor nodules measuring a combined 3
cm.
Primary tumor (pT): Multiple nodules with size greater than 12 cm.
(pT3a)
Margins of resection: Tumor was present at the original superior
resection margin of part A. The final resection margins of part B
are negative.
Vascular invasion: Lymphatic space invasion is identified in block
A7 and A5. No large vessel invasion is identified.
Regional lymph nodes (pN): Not evaluated, pNx.
Distant metastasis (pM): Not evaluated, pMx.
Other findings: Special stains and immunohistochemical stains were
evaluated on block Al. The tumor showed the expected loss of
reticulin staining that one sees in hepatocellular carcinoma. The
tumor showed the usual canalicular spotty staining with CEA. The
tumor cells were completely negative for CK7, CK20 and CK8. The
tumor cells were also negative for HepPar 1.
Although HepPar 1 is usually positive in hepatocellular carcinoma,
higher grade tumors can be negative and that is the finding in this
case.
The background hepatic parenchyma shows findings of steatohepatitis
with approximately 30-40% mixed micro- and macrosteatosis with
chronic inflammation in the portal areas and mild chronic
inflammation within the hepatic lobules. Overall, the findings are
those of moderate steatohepatitis. Stage I fibrosis is noted in the
background hepatic parenchyma. No iron accumulation is identified.
No PAS positive diastase resistant alpha-1 antitripsin globules are
identified. Iron, PAS, PAS with diastase, reticulin and trichrome
stains were evaluated on a representative normal tissue block (A10).
Dr. also reviewed selected slides and concurred with the
diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma and grade 3 interpretation.
Of note, no definitive additional tumor was identified in specimen
B. Cautery artifact was noted in the areas which were considered
grossly suspicious for some residual tumor, but no definitive
residual tumor was identified microscopicly, even though some
additional sections were evaluated.
4x2, 14x2, 15x3, 18x5, 20x5 [A few of the antibodies used in our laboratory may be classified as
analyte specific reagents. These antibodies are monitored and
controlled in our laboratory and their performance for in vitro
diagnosis is well described in the medical literature. They have
not been cleared or approved by the FDA.]
DIAGNOSIS
A., B. Liver, right lobe and additional right lobe margin:
HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA, GRADE 3 OF 4.
Tumor size 12 cm. in greatest dimension with adjacent
satellite nodules combining to 3 cm. in size (pT3a).
Lymphatic space invasion identified.
The final resection margins are negative for tumor.
Background steatohepatitis.

Gross Description
A.Received fresh for tissue procurement labeled ""left liver"" is a 425
g,wedge-shaped, 21.0 x 11.5 x 6.5 cm portion of red-brown liver
parenchyma with a 16.5 x 2.4 x 1.2 cm fatty pedicle along one aspect
(in keeping with ligament of .The capsular surface is deformed
by a bosselated firm subcapsular mass. On sectioning, the mass is
lobulated pale tan-yellow to tan-pink, measuring 8.7 x 7.4 x 6.0 cm. A
portion of the tumor and a portion of normal parenchyma are submitted
for tissue procurement as requested. The tumor extends to within less
than 0.1 cm of the inked capsular surface and is 3.2 cm from the
cauterized margin of resection. A pale firm focus measuring 3 cm in
greatest dimension is noted at the margin (in keeping with cautery
artifact see block 5). The remaining liver parenchyma is "" farm
red-brown without additional mass lesion or abnormality.
Summary: 1 through 4 - tumor to inked capsular surface, 5 - closest

adherent.intramural mass, measuring 0.8 x 0 .6 x 0.3 cm . (Please note: In
the sections. the tumor appears to be on the outside of the hepatic bile
duct). The liver is serially sectioned and approximately 85% of the specimen
is replaced by an irregular tan-white mass ,measuring 9.0 x 7.0 x 5,5 cm. The
mass is composed of lobulated tan-white firm tissue with focal hemorrhage. The
remaining portion of the specimen shows tan-brown hepatic parenchyma with
multiple small satellite lesions, measuring up to 0.6 cm in greatest
dimension, The surgical resection margin is 0.1 cm away from the mass.
Multiple intraparenchymal bile duct lumina are completely occluded by the
tan-white firm tumor tissue. Representative sections are submitted in nine
cassettes as follows :cassetteI - hepatic bile duct margin :cassettes 2 and 3
- possible adherent intraluminal tumor; cassette 4 - surgical resection
margins. of the liver; cassettes 5 through 8 - mass;cassette 9 - satellite
lesions.

A. The gallbladder is appreciably thickened with prominent chronic
inflammation and extensive thickening of the muscularis as well as thickening
of the serosa .It is congested .No tumor is seen.
B. This consists of tumor without presence of uninvolved tissue .Sheets and
nests of cells have small to medium sized nuclei which are slightly irregular
in contour .The cells have predominantly vacuolated cytoplasm .In other
areas it is eosinophilic with little or no vacuolization .Some areas have
increased fibrous stroma.
C/CPC.Tumor is present and similar to that previously described. This
frequently has: intervening zones of fibrosis .It consists predominantly of
sheets of cells with mostly clear cytoplasm .Some areas have a somewhat
trabecular arrangement with d slight suggestion of attempted gland-like
formation however this is not well developed .No tumor is seen at the inked
margins.Tumor is present within ductal lumina in slides 7 and 8. The Criteria

_=_- SPECIAL STAINS: ------ ==--
Special stains have been performed on block 4. No definite tumor cells have
positive staining for CA19.9. Where present, it is consistent with residual
hepatic ductular elements. The tumor is also negative for pancytokeratin
(AE1/AE3). Where present, positive staining is consistent with residual
ducts.
Additional special stain results follow. There is staining of two of three
portions of tumor for CK7 and staining for CK20 predominantly in two of three
portions of tissue with some staining in the third piece. Only small numbers
of tumor cells have staining for HepPar-1. There is strong staining for
CK8/18 (CAM5.2). Staining for vimentin is present within some tumor cells.
There is strong staining for alphal-AT in all tumor cells.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: ----------------------------
The non-neoplastic liver, seen best in blocks 1, 3 and 10, shows no
evidence of cirrhosis. Tumor is present in blocks 1-5 and 7-12.
Sections of the tumor demonstrate hepatocellular carcinoma with
variable features. There are areas with solid and trabecular growth,
typical of hepatocellular carcinoma, and some areas with desmoplastic
stroma and a suggestion of glandular growth. Some areas are well
differentiated (grade 2) while others are moderately (grade 3) and
poorly differentiated (grade 4) with anaplastic giant cells and
numerous mitotic figures. Some areas have tumor cells with cytoplasmic
fat, and some areas have hyaline globules. The surgical margins are
negative, but the satellite nodule noted grossly (block 3) is within 1
mm of the inked margin. The immunostain results support the diagnosis
of hepatocellular carcinoma.
SPECIAL STAINS: -------------------------------------------
Immunostains (blocks 1 and 5):
Alpha fetoprotein Strongly positive
Glypican-3 Strongly positive
Polyclonal CEA Canalicular staining predominantly
HepPar-1 Variable patchy positivity
Cytokeratin 8 Positive in majority of tumor
Cytokeratin 7 Variable positivity, 10 to 25% of tumor cells
Cytokeratin 19 A few areas of positivity, most of tumor negative
EMA Scattered positivity, <2% of tumor cells

MED REC #:"," Site: Liver

Laterality: Not provided in the given report.

Histology: Hepatocellular carcinoma. This diagnosis is based on the microscopic description and special stains that support the presence of hepatocellular carcinoma, such as strong positivity for alpha fetoprotein and glypican-3.

Stage: pT2 (AJCC 8th edition)
The pathologic stage is determined based on the pathological tumor category (pT), regional lymph nodes (pN), and distant metastasis (pM). The given report mentions that there is no evidence of regional lymph node involvement or distant metastases. However, the tumor has invaded blood vessels (lymphovascular invasion) and is larger than 2 cm in greatest dimension, which classifies it as pT2.

Grade: The report mentions that some areas of the tumor are well differentiated (grade 2), while others are moderately (grade 3) and poorly differentiated (grade 4). Therefore, a specific grade cannot be assigned based on this information alone.

Behavior: Malignant
Hepatocellular carcinoma is a malignant tumor with the potential to invade surrounding tissues and metastasize to distant organs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A) SOURCE: Liver, segments 5 & 6
The specimen is received fresh from the OR labeled ""segments 5 and 6"" and
consists a 108 gram, 10.3 x 5.5 x 4.3 cm wedge of red, pale tan liver
parenchyma. The specimen displays a smooth, focally irregular capsular
surface. The margin is inked blue and the tissue is serially
cross-sectioned.
INTRAOPERATIVE PATHOLOGY CONSULTATION: ""Margins free (0.7 cm from the
smaller nodule)."" is rendered by
The cut surfaces display two tumors and two small ovoid irregular nodular
foci. Tumor #1 (4.5 x 4. 2 x 2.5 cm )is located 2.2 cm from the blue- inked margin
and display vaguely lobulated tan cut surfaces interspersed with thin
fibrous septae .Tumor #1 abuts the capsular surface .Extension through the
capsule is not seen.
Tumor #2 (1 cm in diameter) is 0.7 cm from the closest blue-inked margin
and 1.3 cm from tumor #1. Tumor #2 has tan, lobulated soft cut surfaces.
The two small ovoid ill-defined nodularities each measure 0.5 cm in average
diameter. The closest nodule is 0.3 cm from the blue-inked margin. The two
nodules are at least 1 cm from the two tumors. No other lesions are seen on
the red-tan hepatic parenchyma. Representative sections are submitted in
six cassettes labeled:
1-2. Tumor #2 entirely submitted with closest blue-inked margin
3-4. Blue-inked margin closest to tumor #1 to include the two smaller
irregular nodularities, entirely submitted

SPECIMEN/GROSS DESCRIPIaON
A)SOURCE: F rt .al:- t1V4r resection, sect n '5 and , frozen for margin
The specimen is received fresh from the OR labeled ""partial liver
resection, sections 5 and 6 - frozen for margin."" It consists of a 520
gram, 14 x 9.8 x 7.5 cm partial liver resection. The smooth capsular
surface displays an 11.5 x 8 x 7 cm bosselated tan tumor bulging from its
external surface. The margin is inked blue and the tissue is serially cross
sectioned.
INTRAOPERATIVE PATHOLOGY CONSULTATION: ""Tumor grossly 1 cm from cauterized
margin"" is rendered by
The tumor has variegated, lobulated, yellow, tan, pink and brown cut
surfaces with predominantly well-defined edges. The tumor grossly abuts the
gallbladder bed. Extension through the capsule and into the gallbladder bed
is not seen. No other lesions are seen on the red-brown hepatic parenchyma.
The attached 8.7 cm in length and 3 cm in diameter intact distended
gallbladder has smooth glistening serosal surfaces which are mildly
edematous .Received within the gallbladder lumen are numerous 0.8 cm in
average diameter dark green, black multifaceted choleliths aggregating to
6.5 x 4.5 x 0.7 cm. On opening the mucosa displays two components. One
component extending to the cystic duct margin for a length of 2 cm is
red-tan and velvety. The remaining component of the mucosa is pink-tan,
flat to velvety with a slightly thickened wall up to 0.2-0.3 cm thick and
measuring approximately 1.8 cm in greatest dimension. The remaining mucosa
at the body and fundus is tan with thin trabeculations.
Representative sections are submitted in eight cassettes labeled:
1-2. Liver tumor with closest blue-inked margin
3-4. Tumor with adjacent hepatic parenchyma
5-6. Tumor with capsule
7.Gallbladder neck at the transition of thickened wall to relatively
normal-appearing wall at the cystic duct

TheWM&AWreviewed the firer sections and concurs with the diagnosis of hopatooellufar carcinoma.The histornorphology and the inxnunaatains support a diagnosis of hepatlularcarcinoma in spite of the negative Hepar stain .The reason for the negative stainIs not evident as both the internal and external controls stained appropriately.Melanoma and adrenal cortical carcinoma are the two other diagnostic considerations .Melanoma is excluded bythenegati ve Melan -A and 5 -100; adrenal cortica lcarcinoma is excluded by the constellation of morphology and lmmunostaining results.

submitted in one cassette.
B. The specimen is received fresh and is subsequently placed into formalin,
and consists of a portion of liver weighing 859 g and measuring 15.0 x 12.0 x
8.0 cm. The resection margin of the specimen has been inked blue. Sectioning
of the specimen reveals a lobulated necrotic mass occupying approximately 80t
of the liver measuring 12 x 9.6 x 2.4 cm. The border of this mass has an
ill-defined appearance and two small tan nodules are identified within the
liver parenchyma adjacent to this large mass. Both these nodules measures 0.2
cm in greatest dimension. A prominent blood vessel is noted within the liver
parenchyma that contains thrombus material. Grossly the liver capsule has a
lobulated appearance due to invasion of the mass. Grossly the main mass comes
to within approximately 1.5 cm of the blue painted margin. The liver capsule
overlying the normal liver parenchyma has a slightly bumpy appearance
?cirrhosis. Sections of the specimen is as follows:
B1. section of vessel with thrombus at blue painted margin

B4-6. section of nodules on liver capsule
B7. section of nodule on liver capsule and small nodule close to
overlying blue painted margin, 0.2 cm
B8-10. three sections from the large mass
B11-12. two random sections from adjacent liver parenchyma
B13. section of small nodule ?satellite lesion in liver parenchyma
MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
The hepatocellular carcinoma is composed of mainly trabecular and
pseudoglandular pattern. The tumor cells are hyperchromatic with easily
identifiable mitoses. Focal tumor necrosis is also present. There are
peritumoral intravascular invasion. The tumor is focally infiltrating into
the perihepatic adipose tissue (? diaphragm). The immunohistochemical stains
demonstrate the nature of the hepatocellular origin. The tumor cells show
canalicular stain for CEA and are strongly positive for Hep-par-1. They are
negative for CK7, CK20, synaptophysin and AFP. The background hepatic tissue
is cirrhotic. The etiology of cirrhosis cannot be determined.` However, there
are significant numbers of lymphoplasmacytes and eosinophils in the periportal
area. The hepatocytes show no ground glass change or Mallory bodies.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A: The specimenis received fresh and submitted in formalin. The specimen
consists of a 1441 g lobe of liver measuring 17.0 x 17.4 x 9.8 cm. The surface
of the specimenis smooth with a concave appearing neoplasm infiltrating the
surface of the specimen. This areameasures 9.8 x 9.0 cm. This is white in
appearance and slightly necrotic. Surrounding this neoplasm on the surface is
a rim of hemorrhagic area. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal that
this neoplasm is somewhat well circumscribed and measures 13.0 x 11.8 x 8.0
cm. This neoplasm has a homogeneous white/tan appearance. There is some slight
central necrosis. This neoplasm comes to within 0.7 cm of the surgical
resection margin, which has been painted black. Adjacent to this neoplasm is
another well circumscribed white/tan neoplasm measuring 1.4 x 1.2 x 1.2 cm. It
is located 1.0 cm from the largest neoplasm and also 1.0 cm from the resection
margin. Also identified attached to the surface of the specimen is a fibrous
cystic structure measuring 2.0 x 1.4 x 1.2 cm, which is open and contains what
appears to be green bile with an inner mucosal surface.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:Division Head:
Please notethe ^tions of the tumor and normal portions of liver are taken
for Tumor Bank.
Summary of sections:
Al to A8 - Representative sections of the neoplasm including closest points of
invasion to resection margin and surface of the liver capsule.
A9 - Representative section of gallbladder. Portion of tissue attached tot heliver.
A10 - Representative section of the smaller above described nodule in closest
point of invasion to the resection margin.
All - Representative section of normal-appearing liver parenchyma.
MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
Sections show infiltrative carcinoma with morphologic features of
hepatocellular carcinoma. The overall patterns are a combination of
trabecular and pseudoglandular. The nuclei are slightly enlarged and mildly
pleomorphic, however, the cells still have abundant cytoplasm. This would
correspond to a tumor grade of 2. One large nodule is present measuring 9.8
cm in maximum dimension. The gross appearance would correspond to the diffuse
type. The tumor is 0.7 cm from the nearest surgical resection margin. There
is moderate fibrosis within the tumor. Angiolymphatic invasion is not
identified in these sections. Mitotic rate is 6/10 HPF. The non-malignant
liver is unremarkable. One regional lymph node and the gallbladder are also
unremarkable.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. The specimen consists of an intact gallbladder measuring 8.3 c 2.4 x 2.6
cm. The serosal surface is smooth. The lumen contains green bile and no
calculi, and the cystic duct is patent. The mucosa is granular, and the wall
averages 0.2 cm in thickness. The cystic duct lymph node is not identified.
Representative sections are submitted in one cassette.
PLEASE NOTE: There is also a 0.5 cm polyp identified on the mucosa which has
been sampled in the cassette.
B. The specimen is received fresh and is submitted in formalin. The specimen
consists of a segment of liver measuring 13 x 6.9 x 3.7 cm. The resection
margin is dyed with black ink. Grossly on the liver surface, there is a
grossly identifiable light tan nodule which grossly appears to invade the
liver capsule. Upon sectioning through this portion, there is a grossly
identifiable tumor measuring 2.5 x 2.2 x 2.1 cm. This lesion has a nodular
appearance and comes to within 1.0 cm of the surgical resection margin. The
remainder of the specimen is sectioned and reveals no more gross
abnormalities. Representative sections of the tumor including the grossly
deepest point of invasion to the resection margin and the invasion to the
liver capsule are submitted in blocks B1 to B5. Representative sections of
grossly unremarkable liver parenchyma are submitted in block B6.
MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
The gallbladder wall appears thin. The mucosa shows a polypoid lesion
consisting of aggregates of foamy histiocytes covered by intact mucosa,
consistent with a cholesterol polyp. There is no dysplasia. No significant
inflammation is present. The cystic duct is unremarkable.
The liver mass shows features of a hepatocellular carcinoma. The tumor has a
lobulated border with the adjacent hepatic parenchyma. The tumor cells are
arranged in solid sheets, acinar formations and trabeculae. Their cytoplasm
varies from eosinophilic to clear, and the nuclei show moderate to severe
cytologic atypia, with some areas of the tumor demonstrating marked nuclear
pleomorphism and prominent mitotic activity. Coarse fibrous septae are noted
between the lobules of tumor, but no satellite nodules are noted in the
adjacent parenchyma. No vascular invasion is identified. The. adjacent
parenchyma shows moderate microvesicular and macrovesicular steatosis and
evidence of chronic hepatitis, including chronic portal inflammation with
interface hepatitis, and lobular inflammation with hepatocyte dropout. There
is also anisocytosis and anisonucleosis. Trichrome stain reveals evidence of
periportal fibrosis with some bridging, but no evidence of established

C: Microscopic sections show an ill-defined mass arising in the liver. The architecture of the mass includes a trabecular,
solid, and pseudoglandular areas. There are also areas of clear cell change. The trabecular plates are greater than four
cells thick in areas. There is hemorrhage that surrounds the tumor, as well as a focal area of infarct. The mass is present
at the surgical resection margin. The nuclear features of the hepatocellular carcinoma include higher N/C ratio with
hyperchromatic nuclei and pleomorphism. The cytoplasm, in areas, is strongly eosinophilic, while in others, shows a clear
cell change. Immunostains are pending.
The uninvolved liver shows a cirrhotic pattern. There are nodules of hyperplastic hepatocytes surrounded by fibrous
septae that are heavily inflamed. The portal tracts are present and occasionally involved by a periportal lymphocytic
inflammation. Steatosis is also identified. Special stains illustrate the fibrosis surrounding the nodules consistent with
cirrhosis. The reticulin stains show loss of the two cell thick hepatocyte plates. There is no hemosiderin or PAS diastase
resistant inclusions identified.

Gross Description
Received is a singlespecimen. The requisition and specimen container are labelled with the patient's name
The cassette and AP identifiers are labelled with the Surgical Number
A. The specimen is received fresh and is subsequently placed into formalin. The specimen consists of a segment of liver
weighing 223.2 g and measuring 10.0 x 8.0 x 7.0 cm. The surgical resection margin is painted blue. On the liver capsule,
there is a roughened hemorrhagic and indurated area measuring 7.0 x 7.0 cm. This area corresponds with a lobulated
tan and hemorrhagic mass within the liver parenchyma. This mass measures 7.0 x 5.5 x 6.5 cm. Grossly, the mass
comes within 0.5 cm of the blue-painted resection margin. There are also soft necrotic areas noted within the mass. At
the edge of the mass, there is a luminal structure filled with the tumor. The tumor within this luminal structure has a
yellow/green discoloration. The luminal structure measures approximately 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.7 cm.
Sections of the specimen are as follows:
Al and A2 - sections of the luminal structure with tumor.
A3 and A4 - two sections of tumor in relation to blue-painted resection margin.
A5 and A6 - two sections of the liver capsule which is rough and hemorrhagic with underlying tumor.
A7 - section of the tumor involving the liver capsule.
A8 - section of liver parenchyma uninvolved by tumor.
B. The specimen is received fresh and is subsequently placed into formalin. The specimen consists of an ovoid portion
of liver weighing 11.8 g and measuring 4.0 x 3.0 x 2.0 cm. The resection margin is inked blue. The capsule is smooth.
Sectioning reveals a tan ovoid lesion which is well circumscribed and measures approximately 1.5 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm. The
lesion comes within 0.1 cm to 0.2 cm of the blue-painted margin. The lesion is 0.7 cm away from the liver capsule.

Received are specimens A to B. All requisitions and specimen containers are labelled with the patient's name
The cassettes and AP identifiers are labelled with the Surgical Numbe,
A. The specimen is received fresh, subsequently placed into formalin and consists of a slightly congested, non intact
gallbladder, measuring 7.0 x 3.0 x 1.5 cm. The serosal surface is smooth and glistening. Opening the gallbladder reveals
green bile and green, velvety mucosa. The gallbladder wall averages 0.2 cm in thickness. The cystic duct is patent. The
cystic duct lymph node is not identified. Three representative sections are submitted in one cassette.
B. The specimen is received fresh, subsequently placed into formalin and consists of a portion of liver weighing 245
grams and measuring 15.0 x 5.5 x 7.5 cm. The surgical margin is inked blue. Sectioning of the liver reveals a tan,
lobulated, circumscribed mass measuring 5.5 x 4.5 x 6.5 cm. Grossly, this mass extends to the liver capsule giving the
capsule a lobulated appearance in one area. The mass comes to within 0.5 cm of the blue-painted resection margin.
There is a vague nutmeg appearance to the liver parenchyma, otherwise it is unremarkable.
Sections of the specimen are as follows:
B1,B3 three sections through the lobulated surface on the liver capsule
B4,B5 two sections of the mass in relation to the blue-painted margin
B6,B7 two sections of the mass with adjacent unremarkable liver parenchyma
B8 a section of unremarkable liver parenchyma
Microscopic Description
A. Sections show largely unremarkable gallbladder tissue with only minor patchy chronic inflammation in the mucosa and
focal mild subserosal fibrosis. No atypia is present.
B. Sections show a relatively circumscribed but invasive hepatocellular carcinoma that extends to the liver capsule, but
does not show any sign of disruption or breaching of the capsule. The carcinoma grows in sheets with cells showing
relatively abundant cytoplasm but showing variable nuclei with mild to moderate atypia, nucleoli, and patchy
hyperchromasia. Cytoplasmic intranuclear inclusions are also prominent. The tumor cell cytoplasm shows a range of
appearances, from granular eosinophilic to through to areas of clear cell change as well as areas with well developed fatty
change. In places a vague sinusoidal architecture can be seen and intra sinusoidal collections of extramedullary
hemopoiesis are present. Focal areas of hemorrhage, edematous degeneration and focal frank necrosis are present.
The interface between the carcinoma and adjacent liver tissue varies, in areas having a circumscribed and almost
encapsulated margin but elsewhere having a vague merging of cancer cells with adjacent parenchyma. No evidence of
vascular invasion can be identified. , _ .....:. ...... -,,,

A. The specimen is received fresh, subsequently placed into formalin and consists of an
intact gallbladder measuring 8.0 x 3.5 x 2.5 cm. The serosal surface is tan and smooth.
The lumen contains bile and multiple friable yellow calculi measuring up to 0.2 cm in
thickness. The mucosal surface is bile stained and velvety with areas of yellow
speckling. The wall averages 0.2 cm in thickness. The cystic duct is patent. The cystic duct lymph node is not grossly identified. Representative sections are submitted in one
.cassette.
B. The specimen is originally received fresh, subsequently placed into into formalin and
consists of a portion of liver weighing 199.4 grams and measuring 12.7 x 9. 0 x 5.5 cm.
The resection margin is dyed blue. The capsular surface is slightly nodular. upon
sectioning, two firm tan nodules are identified. The smaller nodule measures 0.8 x 0.7 x
0.5 cm. This nodule grossly involves the blue-painted resection margin and comes to
within 0.5 cm of the capsular surface . The second mass measures 2.5 x 2.3 x 2.2 cm. This
mass is 2 .0 cm from the first mass and grossly comesto within less than 0.1 cm from the
capsular surface and 1.2 cm from the blue-painted resection margin. The remainder of the
liver parenchyma is grossly unremarkable.
Representative sections are submitted as follows:
B1 section of the smallest mass in relation to the blue-painted resection margin
B2 section of the smaller mass in relation to the capsular surface
B3 section of grossly unremarkable liver between the first and second mass
B4 section of the second mass in relation to the capsular surface
S5 section of the second mass in relation to the blue -painted resection margin
B6 further section of the second mass

blue. The surface is nodular and has a cirrhotic appearance .The attached gallbladder
measures 9.5 x 3.0 x 2.5 cm and has a smooth surface. There is one lymph node present
near the cystic duct resection site measuring 1.3 cm in greatest dimension .Serial
sectioning of the liver reveals a tan/yellow solid massmeasuring 3.4 x 3.0 x up to 2.8
cm and has a. slightly hemorrhagic area measuring 0.8 cm in greatest dimension on one
side;it bulges toward one area on the liver surface. The tumor has a lobular appearance
and is at least 1.5 cm from the liver resection margin. The rest of the liver parenchyma
appears nodular, with areas of green discoloration .No second mass lesion is identified.
Grossly, the liver mass does not adhere or invade into the gallbladder. Opening of the
gallbladder reveals dark green velvety inner lining, with no calculi present and no
grossly identifiable lesion on the inner lining.
