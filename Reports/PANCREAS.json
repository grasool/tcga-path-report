The specimen is labeled \"Whipple, stitch is retroperitoneal margin\". The specimen consists of\na head of pancreas'` x 5 x 3.5 cm), with adjacent portion of duodenum (25 cm in length and up to 3.5\ncm in circumference at. the distal resection margins) and distal portion of stomach (7.5 cm in length\nand up to 12.0 cm in circumference at the proximal gastric margin). The serosa of the stomach is pink\ntan, mildly congested ,smooth, glistening, while the outer surface of the duodenum is shaggy with a\nsmall amount of fibroadipose tissue attached .There is moderate amount of lesser and greater\nomental adipose tissue attached to the gastric wall. The pancreatic resection margin reveals a pink\ntan, lobulated and grossly unremarkable pancreatic parenchyma. The peripheral aspects of the pancreatic head are composed of a small amount of yellow tan lobulated adipose tissue which is\nranging from 0.1 to 0 .5 cm in thickness .Prior to sectioning the specimen is inked as follows:\nGreen: Anterior aspect of the pancreatic head\nBlack: Superior aspect of the pancreatic resection margin\nOrange: Inferior aspect luncinate process\nRed: Medial aspect\nBlue: Retroperitoneal aspect.\nOn opening the stomach reveals a pink tan, smooth, glistening mucosa which shows preservation of\nrugae.

It consists of an en bloc resection of stomach, duodenum and the head of the\nPage 1 of 4 pailicreas measuring 16.0 x 11.0 x 3.9 cm overall. The portion of distal stomach measures 7.0 cm in length with a\nstapled margin measuring 13.5 cm in circumference. The duodenal segment measures 12.5 cm in length with a distal\nmargin measuring 6.0 cm in circumference. The portion of pancreas measures 6.2 x 6.0 x 4.1 cm. A mass is palpable\nin the pancreas. The pancreatic surgical margin, which occupies an area of 3.9 x 1.4 cm is marked with two long black\nsutures by the surgeon. This margin is submitted en face as BFS I and BFS 2 (BFS1 contains the pancreatic duct).\nThe pancreatic duct is noted at the margin with a diameter of 0.3 cm.

The portal tracts are\nexpanded by a mild inflammatory infiltrate including neutrophils, mild ductular reaction and edema, with mild periportal\nfibrosis confirmed on trichrome and reticulin stains. These features are those of bile duct obstruction. No malignancy is\nidentified. Iron, PAS, DPAS and Victoria blue stains show no additional pathologic features.\nThe pancreatic gastroduodenectomy specimen (Part B) shows a moderately differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma\narising in the pancreas and extending into the duodenum. There is also extension of tumor into the peripancreatic\nadipose tissue. The tumor comes to within 1 mm of the posterior (black inked) surgical margin (Section B9). There is\nperineural invasion as well as tumor invasion within lymphatics, confirmed with D2-40 immunohistochemical stain.\nThere is also multifocal PanIN. In places, there are papillary structures with significant focal atypia, corresponding to\nPanIN3 (section B10); these areas are not present at the resection margin. This supports a pancreatic ductal origin for\nthis tumor.\n1 Page 3 of 4 The green cystic lesion noted grossly corresponds to a reactivefinflammatory, partially cystic process adjacent to the\ncommon bile duct. Many spindled macrophages are present in this area, positive for CD68.. No carcinoma is identified\nin this area with cytokeratin stain. No metastatic carcinoma is seen in ten lymph nodes.\nThe gastroduodenal lymph node (Part C) shows a large reactive lymph node with lipogranulomas.

The\nspecimen is totally submitted in blocks El and E2,\nContainer F is additionally labeled \"gallbladder.\" The container\nholds a cholecystectomy specimen measuring 8 x 3.5 x 2.5 cm. The\nserosal surface is pink/tan and smooth with a rough liver bed\nresection surface. The mucosa is hemorrhagic, velvety and finely\ntrabeculated. The wall is uniform 0.2 to 0.4 cm in thickness.\nThere are no stones. There are scant hemorrhagic luminal\ncontents. No mucosal or mural lesions are noted.\nBlock summary:\nF1 - resection margin with cystic duct and artery and\nrepresentative section from fundus\nF2 - representative sections from mid body and neck\nContainer G is additionally labeled \"pancreaticoduodenectomy\nwith short stitch at uncinate, long stitch at SMA.\" The\ncontainer holds a standard Whipple specimen with the following\nmeasurements: distal stomach 7.5 x 5 cm; portion of greater\nomentum attached to stomach 11 x 4.5 x 1.5 cm; duodenum 24 cm in\nlength x 2.5 cm in average diameter (after fixation); pancreatic\nhead and neck 6 x 4.5 x 4.5 cm. A long stitch marks the\npancreatic margin at the SMA and a short stitch marks the\nuncinate process margin. Inking: common bile duct=yellow,\nresection margin at pancreatic neck=blue, uncinate\nprocess=black, peripancreatic soft tissue=green.\nThe serosal surface of the stomach and duodenum is tan and\nsmooth. The pancreatic head is very firm. Opening the duodenum\nreveals erythematous coarse and thickened mucosa at the ampulla. The remainder of the stomach and duodenal mucosa is beige/tan,\nunremarkable, and appropriately folded. The pancreas is\nsectioned revealing a 4.2 x 4.0 x 4.0 cm white/tan/yellow solid\nfirm mass occupying most of the pancreatic parenchyma in the\nspecimen. The mass has areas of necrotic cystic change along the\ndorsal pancreatic surface. The tumor constricts the common bile\nduct to lumen diameter of 1-2 mm. It comes up'into the ampulla\nand undermines the duodenal mucosa. The tumor infiltrates into\nthe duodenal wall proximal to the ampulla as well, extending up\nto and possibly into the submucosa. The tumor does not involve\nthe pylorus. There is relatively poor demarcation between the\nmass and the pancreatic neck. To assess distance to pancreatic\nneck margin the resection surface of the neck is inked blue and\nsections are taken perpendicular to this surface (true surgical\nmargin at the neck is superseded by the en face G2 section). The\nmass extends to the inked uncinate margin at short stitch and\nthe margin at the SMA at long stitch. It also abuts\nperipancreatic soft tissue. Distance to mucosal margins: stomach\nmargin 16 cm, duodenal margin 13 cm, common bile duct margin 1.5\ncm\nA number of firm lymph nodes are identified in the\nperipancreatic soft tissue ranging in size from 0.2 to 0.6 cm,\nsubmitted per block summary.

The specimen\nis opened along the lesser curvature to reveal regular rugae covered by\nlight tan mucus. The mucosa is tan with a slightly nodular appearance\n(average 0.4 cm in diameter). Representative sections of stomach are\nsubmitted.\nThe pancreas has a rough, yellow, partially cauterized exterior. The neck\nmargin is inked blue, and the remaining radial margins are inked black.\nThe five sutures are identified. Perpendicular sections of these margins\nare submitted. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a white,\nill-defined, indurated mass in the head of the pancreas that extends toI nearly the entire length of the organ. It measures 5 x 3.5 x 2.2 cm. In\nthe inferior limit, the lesion is surrounded by yellow, partially fibrotic\npancreatic parenchyma. The ampulla is patent to the common bile duct. The\npancreatic main duct is obstructed by the pancreatic mass. However, it is\npatent at the pancreatic neck margin. Representative sections are\nsubmitted.\nThe duodenum has congested red serosa near the pancreas. It is otherwise\nunremarkable. The surgical margin is stapled. It is inked black, removed\nand submitted. The specimen is opened adjacent to the mesenteric border to\nreveal a 1.5-cm open defect with central ulceration that is located between\nthe pylorus and the ampulla. The ulcer extends into the pancreas. It\nmeasures 1.1 cm in depth from the surface of the mucosa. It erodes nearly\ninto the proximal limit of the prominent blue metal stent in the ampulla\nthat measures 1.3 cm in diameter and 1.3 cm in length. The mucosa\nsurrounding the ulcerative lesion and the proximal area of the stent is\nfirm with a slight dusky appearance. There is an adjacent mass next to the\nulcer that measures 1.5 x 0.8 cm to a height of 0.9 cm. It bridges between\nthe ulcer and the stented bile duct. The mucosa distal to the bile duct is\ntan and edematous except for the most distal 11 cm of dusky mucosa.\nThe gallbladder has red-purple serosa with punctate areas of green. The\nattached area is rough with a scant amount of cauterized, yellow-lobular\ntissue. It is filled with viscous, red-brown fluid. The cystic duct\nmeasures 1.5 cm in length x 0.5 cm in diameter. There is a small duct that\nmeasures 0.3 cm in length x 0.2 cm in diameter 1.3 cm distal to the neck.\nThis is either one of two candidate hepatic ducts or the cystic artery. Near the insertion of the common bile duct to the pancreas, there is a\ncircular defect that measures 0.4 cm in diameter. It is not certain if\nthis is a surgical defect or if this is another candidate hepatic duct\nopening. Representative sections are submitted.\nSixteen possible pancreatic lymph nodes are dissected and range in from 0.5\nx 0.3 x 0.3 cm to 2.7 x 1 x 1 cm. They are submitted in toto. Six\npossible greater curvature nodes are dissected and range from 0.2 x 0.2 x\n0.2 cm to 0.8 x 0.6 x 0.6 cm. They are submitted in toto.

The pancreatic tissue has a portal vein vascular groove measuring 10\ncm in length which is designated by the long single blue stitch. The\nproximal duodenal staple line measures 6 cm in length, with adhered\npancreatic tissue within 0.5 cm of the surgical staple line and adhered\npancreatic tissue extending down the length of the pancreatic duodenal\njunction. The distal staple line measures 5 cm in length. The pancreatic\nduct margin is marked with a long black stitch and is shaved en face for\nfrozen section (El). Additionally there is a looped blue surgical stitch\ndesignating the SMA margin and a looped black stitch designating the deep\nradial margin. The main pancreatic duct measures 0.5 cm in diameter, and\nis hemorrhagic in appearance. After the sample is taken for frozen\nsection, the residual pancreatic neck margin is inked orange, the vascular\ngroove is inked blue, and the remaining radial margin is inked black. The\ncommon bile duct diameter measures 0.7 cm and a metal surgical stent is in\nplace extending down through the ampulla into the duodenum. The cystic\nduct is identified and is probe patent to the common bile duct. The distal\nduodenal margin is inked black as well as the proximal duodenal margin\nwhich are shaved, and the duodenum is opened longitudinally to reveal a\ndusky tan-brown mucosal surface with normal appearing folds. There is aID\ncl^\n0 small segment of pylorus at the proximal margin measuring 1 cm in length.\nAdditionally there is a small polyp measuring 0.8 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm,\napproximately 1 cm away from the distal margin.

The spleen is without\nspecific diagnostic abnormalities.\nNote: It is uncertain if the poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma has\narisen from the IPMN, or if the IPMN is an incidental finding in the\nbackground. This case has been reviewed in Intradepartmental\nConsultation, with essential concurrence with the interpretation, with\nmost reviewers favoring the IPMN is incidental.\nSpecimen\nDistal pancreas, spleen\nClinical Information\nPRE-OP DIAGNOSIS: Pancreatic cancer Gross Description\nReceived fresh in a container labeled \"distal pancreas, spleen\" is a 9\nx 5.5 x 3.5 cm portion of distal pancreas, which attached 110 g, 10 x\n7.8 x 3.5 cm, spleen. The surface of the spleen is gray-tan and\nwrinkled, and on cut surface it is dark red, smooth, and glistening,\nwith diffuse white stippling, without gross abnormality. There are a\nfew areas on the hilar surface of the spleen, approximately 2 cm in\ngreatest dimension, where the capsule is absent. The pancreas has a\nstapled margin proximally. The staples are removed and this surface is\ninked black. The remainder of the surface of the pancreas is inked\nblue. A firm masscan be palpated from the outer aspect of the\nspecimen. The specimen is sectioned, and there is a white-tan ill\ncircumscribed mass 4.5 x 3.7 x 2.7 cm. The mass is 3 cm from the\nproximal resection margin, and 3.5 cm from the spleen. The pancreatic\nduct can be traced on cut surface to the tumor, but cannot be probed.\nThe pancreatic duct appears to be markedly stenotic and possibly\nobliterated through the area of the tumor. The pancreatic duct lining\nis inked green for identification purposes. There is some residual\nnormal appearing tan pancreatic tissue grossly identified outside of\nthe mass. There is an apparent cystic structure near, but not clearly\nat, the proximal margin of the specimen, 0.7 cm in greatest dimension.\nThis cyst is 0.2 cm from the pancreatic duct. There are a few tan\nlymph nodes identified in the surrounding adipose tissue.

(Please note the specimen has been previously inked\nin focal areas: The bile duct inked blue, uncinate inked yellow, neck inked\nblack.)\nTumor:\nLocation: Pancreatic head\nSize: 3.1 x 2.1 x 1.1 cm\nAppearance: The tumor is white-tan to tan with ill defined borders and a\ndecrease in lobular architecture. The tumor is also firm. Gross impression of invasive growth: There is a biliary stent present in the\nbile duct. After removal, the tumor appears to abut and obstruct the bile duct.\nThe tumor appears to possibly abut the main pancreatic duct, however, there does\nnot appear to be any gross involvement and the pancreatic duct is of the usual\ncaliber. The tumor also appears to abut, but not grossly penetrate through the\nvascular groove. Please defer to microscopic diagnosis.\nResection margins (closest):\nProximal duodenum or stomach: 2.1 cm\nDistal duodenum: 7.4 cm\nBile duct: 2.9 cm\nPancreatic neck/duct: 2.3 cm\nUncinate/Retroperitoneum: 1.1 cm\nOther findings: The attached portion of duodenum has a pink-tan to brown,\nsmooth and roughened serosal surface. There'appears to be a 1.1 x 0.8 cm\ntransmural defect located 5.4 cm from the proximal end. Upon opening the\nduodenum, the mucosa is pink-tan with the normal mucosal folds. The area of\ntransmural defect seems to the area opposing where the bile duct stent was\nlocated .This could be a possible area of local trauma .There are two lesions\npresent on the duodenal mucosal surface. The first lesion is approximately 2.6\ncm from the proximal duodenal margin. This lesion is concerning for possible\ntumor. The lesion appears separate from the ampulla, located on the posterior\nwall of the duodenum. This lesion has dimensions of 1.4 x 1.4 x 0.4 cm. The\nlesion is pink-tan with raised borders with a central ulcerated area.\nRepresentative sections of the first lesion are placed in cassettesAl 4 and Al 5.\nThe second lesion in the duodenum is approximately 4.6 cm from the proximal\nsurface, also located on the posterior wall of the duodenum. This lesion has\ndimensions of 1.4 x 1.3 x 0.8 cm. This lesion is pink-tan with a smooth surface.\nThe cut surface of this lesion is yellow-tan and homogeneous. Representative\nsections of this lesion are placed in cassettes Al 6 and All.\nThe bile duct is removed and submitted for frozen section diagnosis (FSA1). The\ntissue is resubmitted for permanent section in cassette Al.

        "llm_output": " Site: Pancreas, Duodenum, Gallbladder, and Multiple Lymph Nodes\nLaterality: Not provided\nHistology: Adenocarcinoma involving pancreas and duodenum, adenoma of gallbladder\nStage: Not determined in the report\nGrade: Not provided\nBehavior: Malignant (due to the presence of invasive adenocarcinoma)\n\nJustification: The report mentions \"representative sections of tumor\" and \"mass to vascular groove,\" indicating a malignant process, likely adenocarcinoma, in the pancreas. Additionally, the duodenal lesion is described as having a cut surface that is yellow-tan and homogeneous, which can also be indicative of neoplasia or malignancy. The gallbladder contains a moderate amount of markedly viscid bile, which could suggest the presence of a pathological process such as cholecystitis or a gallbladder tumor. However, the report does not provide enough information to determine the stage or grade of these lesions."

The specimen is labeled gallbladder, total pancreatectomy and is received without fixative. It consists\nof a composite resection which consists of a wedge of gastric tissue measuring 9 x 6.5 x 2.5 cm and a 30\ncm segment of duodenum. Attached to the duodenum is a total pancreatectomy specimen with a\npalpable mass at the head of the pancreas. The pancreas overall is 19 cm in length, 6.5 cm from superior\nto inferior and approximately 4.8 cm from anterior to posterior. Blue ink is applied to the superior edge of\nthe pancreas ,orange ink to the posterior lateral surface ,red Ink is applied to the pancreatic notch, and\nblack ink is applied to the posterior/uncinate portion of the pancreas. Green ink is applied along the\nanterior surface. The free serosal surface of the gastric resection and the duodenum is pale red and\nsmooth.\nThe specimen is opened to reveal darkly hemorrhagic gastric mucosa with a rugose pattern extending to\nthe pylorus. The pylorus has a prominent appearance but there is no ulceration or abnormality at the\npylorus. 7 cm distal to the pylorus, the ampulla is identified and a probe is extended through the ampulla\nto located the common bite duct. The surgical margin of the common bile duct is removed and submitted\nfor frozen section as FS1. Serial sections of the head of the pancreas reveal a gritty, tan-white, relatively\nwell-circumscribed neoplasm which measures 5 cm from medial to lateral, 4.5 cm from superior to inferior,\nand 3.3 cm from anterior to posterior.\nIt is 9 cm from the proximal gastric margin and 14 cm form the distal duodenal margin. It is 1.3 cm from\nthe ampulla, 0.2 cm from the closest anterior margin, 1.5 cm from the superior margin, and very close\nproximity to the pancreatic notch margin (inked red) and within 0.2 cm of the closest posterior/uncinate\nCase #:Page 4\nPrintedThis report continues...

In the superior peripancreatic tissue just adjacent to the bile duct, there is a fluid-filled,\nthin-waited 0.7 cm cyst. Sectioning of the remainder of the pancreas reveals fibrotic yellow-tan to\ntan-white parenchyma with scattered fluid-filled cysts which are up to 0.7 cm. The duodenum is up to 5.5\ncm maximally, The distal 8 cm of the duodenum has dark red hemorrhagic mucosa. There are no mucosal\npolyps identified. The perigastric adipose tissue and peripancreatic tissue are dissected for possible nodes.\nAlso in the specimen container is an intact gallbladder which is 7.7 cm in length and 3.8 cm in diameter.\nThe serosal surface is pale violet and smooth. The cystic duct is narrow but patent. The gallbladder well is\nup to 0.3 cm in thickness. The mucosa is yellow and velvety with spotty yellow mucosal stippling.

Part A designated gallbladder. Received in formalin is an intact gallbladder, 8.7 x 2.6 x 2.3 cm. The\nserosa is glistening slightly fatty tan-green. The cystic duct margin demonstrates a 1 mm lumen that is\nprobe patent. The wall is 0.1 cm, and the lumen contains a copious amount of viscous dark green bile\nwith a few minute particulate and no well formed calculi. The rnucosa is velvety, dark green without\ngrossly unusual areas of change suggestive of neoplasia. No grossly unusual areas of change are\nsuggestive of neoplasia. Representative sections are submitted in Al and A2._\nB. Initially received in the fresh state for frozen section evaluation is a generous portion of tissue consistent\nwith a Whipple procedure specimen, The Whipple consists of a generous portion of the antrum of\nstomach, 11.0 cm along the greater, 7.2 cm along the lesser curvature, 5.6 cm in diameter at the proximal\nmargin of resection; the small bowel length is 22.5 cm, 2.5 cm in diameter at the distal margin of\nresection and 3.2 cm in diameter near the head of the pancreas; the pancreas is up to 4.8 cm in length,\n4.4 cm superior-inferior, and 4.0 cm posterior-anterior. The common bile duct extends 0.5 cm and 0.8 cm\nin diameter, with a 0.5 cm patent lumen, A stent protrudes from the bile duct margin. A long silk suture\nmarks the distal pancreatic surgical margin and demonstrates a 0.25 cm diameter duct that is probe\npatent. The pancreatic surfaces/margins are differentially inked as follows: anterior - yellow, superior -\nblue, inferior - green, posterior - black and the pancreatic notch marked red.\nThe stomach is opened along the greater curvature and the length of the small bowel is opened revealing\nthe ampulla of Vater oriented 7,0 cm distal to the pylorus, slightly raised and granular, dusky red, over an\narea of 1.0 x 0.7 cm. The common bile duct is probe patent with the AV. The pancreatic duct inserts into\nthe small bowel just 0.3 cm inferior to the AV (does not communicate). Sectioning through the head of the\nhead of the pancreas reveals an ill-defined, mucinous, light gray to admixed yellow, mass lesion within\nthe superior head of the pancreas, measuring upwards of 3.1 x 2.5 x 2.0 cm. Grossly, the tumor is 1.2 cm\naway from the distal pancreatic margin. The tumor is within 0.1 cm of the superior margin, 0.1 cm of the\nposterior ( including pancreatic notch), 1.7 cm from inferior, and 0.3 cm from anterior. Near the CBD, there\nis a palpable, firm lymph node that is sectioned, revealing a mucinous, dense, light gray appearance. The\nbile duct margin, pancreatic margin and lymph node are submitted/represented for frozen section\nevaluation. A representative portion of the grossly positive lymph node and possible tumor within the head\nof the pancreas is submitted for studies - tumor bank. The tumor partially abuts the small\nbowel wall along the superior-anterior head of the pancreas with a single 0.2 cm focus of involvement\nthrough the small bowel muscularis (B7). The tumor partially abuts the CBD, however, the length of the\nlumen is wrinkled and light tan without gross invasive tumor. The grossly uninvolved pancreas is\nsemi-congested-inflamed, lobular, yellow-tan parenchyma, with transient areas of induration-density.\nExamination of the peripancreatic fat reveals nineteen lymph nodes ranging from 0.3 cm to 2.0 x 1 .7 x\n0.8 cm each, The presence of invasive tumor within the fat makes lymph node identification difficult.\nCase #.

The\nspecimen is comprised of distal portion of pancreas (9.0 x 9.0 x 3.5 cm), and spleen (12.0 x 8.0 x 4.0 cm). The proximal pancreatic margin is received\nstapled. The staple line is removed the underlying parenchyma is inked blue. Bulging from the inferior aspect of the pancreas is a 7.0 x 5.0 x 3.5 cm\npreviously ruptured cyst- Cyst contents are not present The inner lining is pink-tan and wrinkled. The pancreas is inked black. A representative\nsection from the proximal pancreatic margin submitted for frozen section with residual entirely resubmitted for permanent section. Further sectioning\nthrough the pancreas reveals a 5.0 x 4.0 x 3.2 cm gray-white indurated mass that approaches to within less than 0.1 cm of the superior, inferior, anterior,\nand posterior pancreatic surfaces. Additionally, this mass abuts the aforementioned cyst. The cysts grossly communicates with the main pancreatic\nduct. No normal appearing pancreatic parenchyma is identified. This mass approaches to within 1.5 cm of ttie sptenic hilum which is grossly uninvolved.\nOn section and palpation, two possible peripancreatic lymph nodes are identified near the stapled margin.They are 0.5 and 0.7 cm in greatest\ndimension-No lymph nodes are identified at the splenic hilum. The spleen weighs 154 grams and features an intact purple-gray capsule. Sectioning\nreveals a beefy red glir'-ni- '-\" e'\"fnre with punctate white pulp. No masses or lesions are identified. Representative sections are submitted in\ncassettes Al -16 labelelesignated as follows: 1 - frozen section residue; 2 - mass to superior pancreas, perpendicular, 3 - mass to\nsuperior pancreas and splenic artery, perpendicular; 4 - mass to inferior pancreas, perpendicular 5 - mass to anterior pancreas, perpendicular; 6\nmass to posterior pancreas, perpendicular; 7 -- mass to include adjacent cyst wall and pancreatic duct; 8-9 - additional mass to include adjacent cyst\nwall; 10 - additional mass; 11 - additional cyst wall to include inked surface, perpendicular; 12 - two whole possible intraparenchymal lymph nodes; 13-\n16 -- spleen.

Histologically, the tumor consists of crowded, atypical cells arranged in sheets and nests. The nuclei are irregular and hyperchromatic. Mitotic figures are easily identified. There is extensive necrosis present. The overall features are consistent with a high-grade non-small cell lung carcinoma. Staging CT scan showed no evidence of mediastinal or hilar adenopathy, nor distant metastasis.\n\n1. Site: right upper lobe of the lung - As mentioned in the report, the patient presented with a right upper lobe lung mass.\n2. Laterality: right - Mentioned in the site information as the right upper lobe.\n3. Histology: high-grade non-small cell carcinoma - The report states that the histological features are consistent with a high-grade non-small cell lung carcinoma.\n4. Stage: T2N0M0 - The tumor has invaded the visceral pleura (T2), but there is no evidence of mediastinal or hilar adenopathy (N0) or distant metastasis (M0).\n5. Grade: III/High grade - As it is a high-grade non-small cell carcinoma, it falls under Grade III.\n6. Behavior: malignant - High-grade carcinomas are by definition malignant as they show invasion of the surrounding tissues."

The container is\ndesignated \"gallbladder\". The specimen consists of a collapsed gallbladder with abundant\nfatty tissue around the gallbladder. The gallbladder measures 7.C cm in length and up to\n2.5 cm in transverse diameter. On opening the gallbladder it contains a small amount of\nmucoid bile as well as small fragments of calculus material ranging from 0.2 cm up to 0.8\ncm.The mucosal surface is green and velvety. The gallbladder wall measures up to 0.2\ncm in thickness. A cystic duct lymph node is visible at the proximal resection margin.\nThe proximal resection margin and cystic duct lymph node are submitted in Al.\nRepresentative sections from the body and fundus are submitted in A2.\nB.Specimen is received fresh and subsequently fixed in formalin. The container is\ndesignated \"Whipple's specimen\". The specimen consists of a pancreatic duodenectomy\nspecimen .The duodenal portion measures 32.0 cm in length with a short segment of distal\nantrum, 2.0 cm in length. The head of pancreas measures 6.0 cm from superior to\ninferior, 3.5 cm from medial to lateral and approximately 3.5 cm in thickness from\nanterior surface to retroperitoneal resection margin. The superior mesenteric vessel Page 3 of 4\ngroove is painted green and the protruding uncinate process is painted orange. The\nretraper:i.r..oneal soft tissue margin is painted black.The resection margin at the neck of\nthe pancreas is painted blue. The ampulla of Vater is somewhat protuberant, measuring\n1.5 cm across with mucosal congestion. The gallbladder is layed open to reveal a firm\ntumorous mass encircling the common bile duct starting 0.8 cm from the opening of the\nampulla and extending out the common bile duct for a distance of 2.0 cm. The remaining\nproximal common bile duct is 2.5 cm from the proximal extent of the mass. There is a\nbifurcation, likely representing a low insertion of the cystic duct. The bifurcation\nlies 1.5 cm from the proximal common bile duct margin. An incision from the uncinate\nprocess aspect at the head of pancreas shows a hard tumorous mass that occupies\napproximately 50% of the head of pancreas measuring 3.0 cm from superior to inferior,\napproximately 2.0 cm from the wall of the common bile duct in a medial-lateral\norientation and approximately 2.5 cm in thickness in AP orientation. The tumor appears\nto lie closest to the retroperitoneal resection margin although soft friable. fatty tissue\nis present at the surface. The section of the soft tissue around the head of the\npancreas yields a distinct node at the proximal end of the common bile duct, two lymph\nnodes along the superior edge of the head of pancreas, approximately four enlarged firm\nareas, possibly nodes, in the adipose tissue attached to the distal stomach,\napproximately four lymph nodes in the gastroduodenal zoneand approximately three lymph\nnodes in the fatty tissue at the inferior aspect at the head of pancreas.\nSections are taken as follows:\n21 - proximal common bile duct resection margin.\nB2 - resection margin at neck of pancreas\nB3 - :inferior edge at head of pancreas, perpendicular.\n84 through B7 - transverse sections of posterior aspect of pancreatic head from interior\nto superior.\nB8 through B13 - transverse sections of anterior half of head of pancreas from inferior\nto superior.\nB14 - lymph node at proximal end of common bile duct.\nB15 - lymph nodes at superior edge of head of pancreas.\n816 and B17 - lymph nodes an lesser curve of stomach.\nB18 and B19 - gastroduodenal lymph nodes.\nB20 - lymph nodes at inferior edge at head of pancreas.\n1321 - representative section of proximal resection margin, perpendicular.\nB22 - distal resection margin, perpendicular.\nMicroscopic Description\nA.Sections show gallbladder tissue with chronic cholecystitis, but no cytologic atypia\nin the mucosa of the gallbladder. The cystic duct lymph node shows accumulation of\nmacrophages with areas of hyalinization, but without significant mineral oil\nlipogranulomatosis. No sign of malignancy is present.\nB.Sections of the head of pancreas shows an invasive moderate to poorly differentiated\npancreatic duct adenocarcinoma that invades along the distal common bile duct, extends\nthrough the wall adjacent duodenum and involves the orifice of the ampulla of Vater. The\nbulk of the cancer, however, lies in the inferior part of the head of the pancreas\nfocally extending to a cauterized inferior margin and focally to a cauterized edge in the\ngroove of the superior mesenteric vessels. There is also areas of lymphovascular\ninvasion and perineural invasion.Focal residual ducts on the periphery of the cancer\nshows changes of PANIN grade II. The pancreatic neck resection margin is clear and no\nclear involvement of the main pancreatic duct can be seen. Also, the secondary\npancreatic papilla is visualized with no direct invasion by cancer. The proximal\nresection of the common bile duct is clear of tumor. Multiple lymph nodes included in\nthe sections of the head of the pancreas shows metastatic carcinoma and together with\nadditional lymph nodes dissected separately, there appears to be up to 19 lymph nodes,\nincluding the nodes in the distal perigastric tissue.

The duodenal mucosa has the normal pattern of folds,\nwithout polyps or other lesions. The retroperitoneal margin ( designated with a blue\nsuture) is inked blue and the SMA groove is inked green, and the pancreatic neck margin\nis inked black. A portion of the pancreatic duct is identified at the pancreatic neck\nmargin, but the duct appears occluded lessthan 1 cm from the margin. Replacing much of\nthe head of the pancreas ,there is an ill-defined roughly 3.7 x 3.5 x 3.5 cm firm rubbery\ntan white masswith infiltrative borders.

A stitch marks the true margin. The\nspecimen is submitted in block A for frozen section of the margin.\nB.Received fresh for frozen section labeled with the patient's name and \"common bile\nduct margin\" is the common bile duct margin consisting of two dilated ducts. one measuring\n1.5 cm and an adjacent smaller duct measuring 0.8 cm.

The pancreatic\n** CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE ** RUN DATE:\nRUN TIME:\nRUN USER:Specimen Inquiry\nLab Database:\nSPEC#: PATIENT:PAGE 3\n(Continued)\nGROSS DESCRIPTION: (Continued)\nmargin measures 2 x 1.5 cm. Blue ink is applied to this margin. There is a stent\nwithin the common bile duct. Black ink is applied to the common bile duct margin. Black\nink is also applied along the stapled gastric margin and blue ink is applied along the\nstapled duodenal margin. The adipose tissue adjacent to the lesser and greater curvature\nare separated for lymph node dissection. The specimen is opened lengthwise along the\nlesser curvature and along the border of the duodenum. The mucosa surrounding the ampulla\nof Vater is heaped up and hyperemic for three-fourths of the circumference. I am hesitant\nto completely open the specimen in the fresh state as that this may represent an ampullary\nor periampullar area tumor which would require better fixation. In an attempt to see if\nthere is a pancreatic head mass .Iplaced an incision along the posterior aspect of\nthe pancreas going into the head of the pancreas revealing a possible tumor within the\npancreatic head where the pancreatic tissue has a more gray-white appearance and fibrotic\ntexture. Within the plane of section, this area measures approximately 1.5 cm. A small\nportion of this area is provided to the tissue bank coordinator. The specimen is then\npinned out on corkboard and placed into formalin for overnite fixation prior to further\nsectioning and evaluation. Blue ink is further applied to the staple line adjacent to the\nuncinate process.\nThe fixed specimen is evaluated, A longitudinal cut is made from the ampulla of Vater\nthrough to the common bile duct margin. In this plane, a tumor is identified in the\nperiampullary region from the ampulla of Vater extending for 2.3 cm. The tumor tapers at\nthe junction of the common bile duct and pancreatic duct. This area is contiguous with the\narea in the pancreatic head identified at the time of initial evaluation for tissue\nbanking and the mass is judged to measure approximately 3 cm. Several peripancreatic\nlymph nodes are identified which range from 0.8 to 1.5 cm. Several lymph nodes are\nidentified along the lesser curvature ranging up to 1 cm.\nCassette Summary:\nC1-common bile duct margin of this specimen\nC2-pancreatic margin of this specimen\nC3--longitudinal section through ampulla of Vater\nC4,5 - perpendicular sections through ampulla of Vater\nC6,7 - sections adjacent to retroperitoneal (uncinate) margin\nC8-10- additional sections of tumor\nC11,12- peripancreatic lymph nodes with two lymph nodes present in C12 bisected, one\ninked\nC13,14- lesser curvature lymph nodes\nC15-gastric margin\nC16-pylorus\nC17-small bowel margin\nD.Received fresh labeled with the patient' s name and peripancreatic node is a 2 x 1.3 x\n0.5 cm tan lymph node bisected and submitted in block D.\nINTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION:\nFROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS:\nA.PANCREATIC MARGIN:\n** CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE ** RUN DATE:\nRUN TIME:\nRUN USER:\nSPEC tt : - PATIENT :Specim\nLab Database:PAGE 4\n(Continued)\nINTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION: (Continued)\n-NEGATIVE FOR INVASIVE CARCINOMA WITH PANCREATIC INTRADUCTAL NEOPLASIA GRADE 1\nIDENTIFIED\nB.COMMON BILE DUCT MARGIN:\nINFLAMMATION, FIBROSIS, REACTIVE GLANDULAR EPITHELIUM AND FOCAL ATYPICAL\nGLANDULAR EPITHELIUM WITH NO OBVIOUS INVASIVE CARCINOMA IDENTIFIED\nResults given to Dr. in the operating room at\nG.GROSS INTRAOPERATIVE EVALUATION:\n-FIBROTIC MASS PRESENT IN HEAD OF PANCREAS ADJACENT TO UNCINATE PROCESS ON\nPARTIAL DISSECTION WITH TISSUE PROVIDED TO TISSUE BANK COORDINATOR\n--GROSS MARGINS APPEAR FREE OF INVOLVEMENT\nFINDINGS DISCUSSED WITH DR. 9090IN THE OPERATING ROOM AT\nSigned (signature on file)\n** END OF REPORT **\nultfoancV\nDlagnosrs u.- or Site Discre\nary TurnimprncaY lp AA DiscreP\n>l ...cv xiVignpriorMa\nn..a1\n&-saisljiy",

The proximal staple line is removed\nand the freshly exposed surface is lightly inked blue. The\ndistal duodenum reveals a staple closure as well and a\ncircumference of 5 cam with the circumference measuring 4.5 cm at\n-tielevel of the ampulla .The common duct has been previously\nopened and measures 5.5 cm in length with a proximal\ncircumference of 2 cm diminishing to 0.8 cm at the ampulla. The\nmucosa of the common duct is relatively smooth and yellow/tan.\nThe duodenum in the area of the ampulla reveals a discrete area\nof induration and effacement over an area measuring 2 x 1.5 cm\nwhich corresponds to a relatively well-demarcated ,firm and Page 3 of 4\nyellow/tan mass occupying the head of the pancreas with the mass\nmeasuring 3 x 3 x 3 cm in greatest dimensions. The pancreatic\nresection margin measures 3.3 x 1.5 cm and has been previously\ninked black.The pancreas itself measures overall 6 cm superior\nto inferior x 3.5 cm right to left x 4.5 cm anterior to\nposterior.Soft tissue inferior to the pancreas has been\npreviously inked black in a ragged area where there is a suture\ndesignated as identifying a portion of superior mesenteric\nvein.This area of tissue is indurated and continuous with the\npreviously described inferior pancreatic tumor.The tumor is\nseparated from the pancreatic resection margin by a minimum of 2\ncm grossly normal pancreas. The section code is as follows:\nAl=shave of pancreatic resection margin; A2=shave of distal\nduoderial margin; A3=proximal duodenum parallel to the lumen,\nposterior, with proximal aspect inked blue after removing staple\nclosure; A4=shave of proximal common duct resection margin;\nA5-AlO=sutured area indicating superior mesenteric vein remnant,\nblocked out, serially sectioned perpendicular to surface and\ntotally submitted (note that vein is not recognized grossly);\nAil-A13=apparently ulcerated duodenum overlying pancreatic\ntumor; A14=duplicate cross-sections of proximal common duct not\nto include resection margin; A15, A16=ampulla of Vater adjacent\nto overlying tumor parallel to lumen of common duct; A17,\nA18=additional sections of tumor not to include resection\nmargin; A19-A20 and A21-A22=two dominant lymph nodes serially\nsectioned and totally submitted, two cassettes each; A23,\nA24=two additional lymph nodes, serially sectioned and totally\nsubmitted, separate cassettes; and A25-A28=additional potential\nlymph nodes from. periductal area.\nPhysicians\nProcedure\nA.AA ROUTINE H&E X1 BLOCK.1\nH&E Xi\nA.AA ROUTINE H&E Xl BLOCK.2\nH&E Xl\nA.

As stated in the original\nreport, this pancreas is involved by ductal adenocarcinoma. The neoplasm shows\ndiscontiuous spread and appears to arise from a background of high grade pancreatic\nductal dysplasia, with tumor surrounding dilated ductal elements (4H and 41). There is\nperiampullary involvement (4F). The lack of continuity between foci makes evaluation\nof tumor size difficult, but it appears greater than 2 cm overall. Perineural tumor is\npresent. There are multiple peripheral foci consistent with atrophic change, some\nassociated with inflammation. The designated surgical margins (1-3) are negative for\ndiagnostic dysplasia or malignancy. The permanent sections of the bile duct (4G),\ntaken from the Whipple specimen, show foci of glandular dysplasia in a background of\ninflammation (particularly in the deeper levels). There is no involvement by carcinoma,\nhowever. The true margin was submitted at the time of surgery (specimen #1) and is\nnegative. All examined lymph nodes are negative for diagnostic metastatic disease.\nADDENDUM DIAGNOSIS:\n1.Bile duct margin ,biopsy:\n-Negative for diagnostic high grade dysplasia or malignancy.\n2.Pancreatic neck margin ,biopsy:\n-Negative for diagnostic high grade dysplasia or malignancy.\n3.Pancreatic uncinate margin ,biopsy:\n-Negative for diagnostic high grade dysplasia or malignancy ;atrophy.\n4.Pancreas ,distal stomach and proximal small bowel ,Whipple resection:\n-Ductal adenocarcinoma of pancreas ,moderately differentiated.\n-Resection margins negative (see above discussion).\n-Seventeen (17) peripancreatic lymph nodes ,NEGATIVE for metastatic\ncarcinoma.\n5.Stent (gross only):\n-Plastic tubing ,consistent with stent.\n6.Lymph nodes ,celiac ,regional resection:\n-Two (2 )lymph nodes, NEGATIVE for metastatic carcinoma.\n7.Lymph node, portal ,biopsy:\n-One (1 )lymph node ,NEGATIVE for metastatic carcinoma. ***Carcinoma of Pancreas Summary***\nSpecimen: Head of pancreas ,distal stomach, proximal small bowel,\ncommon bile duct.\nProcedure :Pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple resection ),partial\npancreatectomy.\nTumor site :Pancreatic head.\nTumor size: Cannot be determined, greater than 2 cm by gross\nexamination.\nHistologic type :Ductal adenocarcinoma.\nHistologic grade: Moderately differentiated, grade 2.\nMicroscopic tumor extension :Tumor within pancreas (prominent\naround pancreatic duct )and involves\nperiampullary region.\nMargins: Margins uninvolved by invasive carcinoma (see discussion\nof bile duct above).\nTreatment effect: N/A.\nLymphovascular invasion: Not identified.\nLymph nodes :Twenty (20) lymph nodes, negative for metastatic\nmalignancy - see above.\nPerineural invasion :Present.\nPathologic staging: pT2, pNO (AJCC/UICC TNM 7th edition).\nAdditional pathologic findings: Pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia,\nPanlN-3.\nClinical Information\nPre-op diagnosis: Pancreatic mass\nProcedure: Whipple\nPost-op diagnosis: Pancreatic mass\nClinical History: Pancreatic mass\nSpecimen Submitted\n1.Bile duct margin\n2.

OPICSections of the tumour confirm a well to moderately differentiated ductal carcinoma arising in the\nposterior body/neck adjacent to the mid to distal common bile duct (CBD). The overall tumour\ndimensions are 20 x 20 x 20mm. The tumour spreads alongside the mid common bile duct (with a\ncommon bile duct margin of 10mm). Tumour shows a gland and ductal architecture with marked\ndesmoplasia and extensive perineural infiltration. There is extensive perineural invasion and spread\ninto the peripancreatic tissue. Tumour invades the wall of the portal vein (Block 3) but does not reach\nthe lumen or involve the peripheral venous resection margin. The tumour comes to within lmm of the\nposterior soft tissue margin at the neck of pancreas (blocks 4 and 7) Lymphovascular space invasion is\nnoted (Blocks 4) with extension into a peripancreatic node(Block 8) with a micrometastis in a\nperipancreatic node (Block 4) and periuncinate node (block 15). Adjacent to the tumour high grade\nPan1N is identified (block 8).\nREVIEWING DOCTOR 'S SIGNATURE:DATE:\nPage 2 of 4 Sections from the pancreatic neck resection margin show chronic pancreatitis. No high grade PanIN is\nidentified. Sections from the proximal common bile duct margin show no evidence of malignancy and\nuninvolved cystic duct node.\nRepresentative sections from the ampulla of Vater show reactive changes within the common bile duct\nepithelium along with some epithelial hyperplasia. Representative sections from the pancreas\nelsewhere show normal morphology of ducts without PanIN. Fatty infiltration of the pancreas is seen in\nBlocks 11 & 12 with associated fat necrosis. Representative sections from the gallbladder show\nRokitansky-Aschoff sinus formation with fibrosis of the gallbladder wall and a mixed inflammatory\ncell infiltrate. The gallbladder mucosa is attenuated and shows underlying haemorrhage.\nCholesterolosis is not identified. Representative sections from the proximal gastric margin are within\nnormal limits. Representative sections from the pylorus are within normal limits. Representative\nsections from the distal small bowel margin are also within normal limits.\nThree out of eight peripancreatic nodes contain tumour (including the one seen in Block 4 and\nincluding the one seen in Block 8 and block 15). No lesser curve nodes are identified. Only one single\nlymphoid aggregate is noted from the greater curve.

Grossly, a 1.8 cm greatest\ndimension green gallstone is identified. Representative sections\nare submitted in cassette Al.\nThe second specimen labeled \"Whipple specimen\" is received fresh\nfrom the OR and consists of a piece of small bowel with attached\npancreas measuring 32 x 7 x 5 cm. The uncinate margin is inked in\nblue, the vascular growth is inked in black and the pancreatic\nresection margin is inked in green. The common bile duct and\npancreatic duct are probed. The specimen is incised on the anterior\naspect and a palpable firm, tan, well circumscribed mass is revealed\nmeasuring 4.1 x 3.5 x 3.1 cm. Sections are submitted as follows: B1\ndistal duodenal margin, B2 proximal duodenal margin, B3 bile duct\nmargin, B4-5 pancreatic resection margin, amputated and submitted on\nedge, B6-7 uncinate margin, amputated and submitted on edge, B8 full\ncross section of tumor from green ink to the duodenum, B9\ncross-section of tumor to black ink, B10 tumor surrounding common\nbile duct to black ink, Bll representative section of tumor, B12\nnormal appearing pancreas, B13-21 peripancreatic fat for lymph\nnodes.\nCOMMENT: Histological sections show pancreatic adenocarcinoma\ncentered around the pancreatic duct.

Representative sections are submitted in one\ncassette labeled A.\nB. DISTAL PANCREAS AND SPLEEN\nReceived fresh and subsequently fixed in formalin in a single matching container is a distal\npancreatectomy/splenectomy specimen weighing 168 grams overall. The spleen measures 11.0 x 6.5 x\n4.0 cm and the pancreatic portion measures 11.0 x 5.5. x 3.8 cm. There is a stapled margin at the\nproximal aspect of the pancreas measuring 3.5 cm in length. The entire anterior aspect of the pancreas\nand spleen are inked blue. The posterior aspect of both pancreas and spleen is inked black. On serial\nsectioning is a firm, tan-white mass present within the pancreatic parenchyma that measures 4.2 x 3.1 x\n2.4 cm. Tissue is procured from the mass. Grossly the mass extends to within 0.1 cm of the anterior\nretroperitoneal margin. Grossly the pancreatic duct cannot definitively be identified. The mass also\nextends to within 0.1 cm of the posterior retroperitoneal margin. The splenic surface has a coarsely\ngranular texture. Serial sectioning reveals no focal lesions. The pancreatic mass is located 1.2 cm\nfrom the splenic hilum. The spleen is uninvolved by the mass. Representative sections are submitted\nas follows:\n131:proximal pancreatic margin (stapled margin)\n132-B5: mass with anterior and posterior retroperitoneal margins\nB6-B7: mass with margins and adjacent grossly uninvolved pancreas\nB8-B9: spleen\nB10: spleen-pancreas interface\n1311: vasculature\nB12-B13: spleen artery and vein\nB14: four possible lymph nodes\nBI 5-1323: additional possible lymph nodes\nC.
