There are two tumor foci, one of peripheral\nzone and one of transition zone origin. The dominant tumor focus is located in the right anterolateral, right lateral, right\nposterolateral, right posterior, mid posterior, left posterior, left posterolateral, left lateral and left anterolateral peripheral zone with\nextension into the transition zone. This tumor focus measures 4.0 x 3.0 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and it is\npresent in three cross sections and extensively in the apex and base regions. This tumor focus exhibits multifocal extraprostatic\nextension and multifocal extension to the margin of resection. This tumor focus extensively invades both seminal vesicles\nincluding intra and extraprostatic portions and perivesicular soft tissue. The second tumor focus is located in the right and left\ntransition zone. This tumor focus measures 2.0 x 1.0 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in three cross\nsections, extensively in the apex and focally in the base region. This tumor focus is of lower histologic grade (Gleason score\n6/3+3) and it is confined to the prostate.\nPlease refer to the previous report for the diagnosis of the pelvic lymph nodes.\nGROSS :DESCRIPTION\n(C) PROSTATE, SEMINAL VESICLES - A prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles and attached segments of right and\nleft vasa deferentia.\nThe prostate gland (5.3 x 3.5 x 3.6 cm, 56 gm, postfixation) has the usual shape. A nodule is palpated in the right mid and\nright base regions.

However, it can be inferred to be the breast based on the context.\n* Laterality: The laterality (left or right side) of the breast is also not provided in the report.\n* Histology: The histology of the tumor is invasive ductal carcinoma, which means the cancer has developed from the milk ducts and has invaded the surrounding tissue.\n* Stage: The stage of the cancer is T2N1M0, which indicates that the tumor is greater than 2 cm in size, has spread to at least one axillary lymph node, but has not yet metastasized to other parts of the body.\n* Grade: The grade of the cancer is not provided in the report. However, it can be inferred that it is a high-grade tumor based on the fact that it has invaded the surrounding tissue.\n* Behavior: The behavior of the cancer is malignant, meaning it is capable of spreading to other parts of the body and causing harm.\n\nThe reason for the discrepancy between pathology and radiology reports could be due to differences in interpretation or measurement of the tumor size, location, and involvement of lymph nodes. Without access to both reports, it is difficult to provide a definitive justification for the discrepancy."

The tumor is located in the right posterolateral, right\nposterior, mid posterior, and left posterior peripheral zone. The tumor focus measures 2.5 x 0.9 cm in the largest cross-sectional\ndimension, and it is present in the three cross sections of the prostate, extensively in the apex and focally in the base region. The\ntumor is confined to the prostate. The margins of resection are free of tumor.\nGROSS DESCRIPTION\n(D) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A specimen consisting of a prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles and\nattached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.\nThe prostate gland (5.2 x 2.5 x 3.8 cm, 36 grams, post-fixation) has the usual shape. The soft tissue present along the\nposterolateral aspect of the prostate is abundant and more extensive along the right side. An area of firmness is noted on the\nmidline posterior surface of the prostate. Serial cross sections after fixation demonstrate an area of tumor in the mid posterior\nregion of the two cross sections of the prostate.\nThe seminal vesicles and segments of vasa deferentia are grossly free of tumor.\nSECTION CODE: D1-D3, right seminal vesicle and segment of right vas deferens from the base towards the tip; D4, D5,\nleft seminal vesicle and segment of left vas deferens from the base towards the tip; D6, prostatic base right border; D7-D9,\nprostatic base right posterior border; D10-D12, prostatic base central portion; D13, D14, prostatic base left border; D15, D16,\nprostatic base left posterior border; D17, D18, apex anterior; D19, D20, apex left; D21, D22, apex posterior; D23, D24, apex right;\nD25-D36, sections of the three cross sections of the prostate according to specimen radiograph.\nThe anterior aspect of the prostate is inked in green, left surface in red, right surface in yellow and posterior surface in\nblack. Blue ink (D7, 8, 10-12, 19-24, 27, 28, 32 and 36) and orange ink (D31) denote surfaces that do not represent a true margin\nof resection.

Specimen (s) Received\nA:Prostate, radical resection (fresh)\nClinical History\nThe patient is a year-old man with prostate cancer, Gleason grade 3+3.\nGross Description\nThe specimen is received fresh in one part, labeled with the patient's name and medical record number\nand \"prostate and seminal vesicles, left ampulla single short stitch; right seminal vesicle single long.\" It\nconsists of three separate pieces of tissue. One is the prostate gland, the second is the left ampulla (as\ndesignated by the surgeon with a single short stitch), and the third piece Is the right seminal vesicle (as\ndesignated by the surgeon with a single long stitch). The prostate will be described first. The prostate\ngland measures 4 cm from apex to base, 6 cm from medial to lateral, and 4 cm from anterior to\nposterior. The exterior of the gland Is roughened and pink-tan. Focal cautery markings are seen along\nthe base/bladder margin. Sutures are present along the anterior midline. Tiny metal staples are also\nfound embedded. There is a left seminal vesicle/vas deferens bundle attached, measuring 1.7 x 2 x 0.6\ncm. The right seminal vesicle/vas deferens bundle is not attached; as noted by the surgeon, they were\ndetached intraoperatively and will be described below. The left seminal vesicle/vas deferens bundle Is\nsoft, pink-tan, and whorled and has no discrete lesions. The right anterior surface of the gland Is inked\nIn green, the left anterior surface Is inked in blue, and the posterior surface is inked in black. The\nspecimen Is bisected roughly perpendicular to the urethral channel, and two fresh 6-mm punch biopsies\nare taken for research purposes. The two halves of the specimen are then glued, and the prostate is\nfixed prior to further sectioning. Following fixation, the apical and bladder margins are removed, and\nthe remainder of the gland is serially sectioned, from apex to base, into three serial slices. The serial\nslices reveal central and transitional zones composed of firm, slightly lobulated, pink-tan, and partially\ncystic tissue surrounded by firmer, white-tan, striated tissue. The periphery is composed of a thinner\nrim of softer, semi-porous, light tan tissue along the posterior surface. One suspicious lesion Is seen in\nthe right half of serial slices 1 and 2 and 3. This suspicious lesion is firm yellow-tan, and irregular and\nmeasures 0.7 cm in greatest dimension. Following further dissection and submission of tissue for\npathologic evaluation, serial slice 3 is taken for tissue banking/research purposes.\nThe second piece of tissue, which the surgeon designates as left ampulla with a single short stitch, is\nfirm, irregular, and pink-tan, weighs 1 gm, and measures 2 x 1 x 0.5 cm. The external surface of the\nleft ampulla is inked blue.

The tumor is located in the right lateral, right\nposterolateral, right posterior, mid posterior, left posterior, left posterolateral and left lateral peripheral zone. The tumor focus\nmeasures 3.0 x 1.4 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension, and it is present in the two cross sections of the prostate and\nextensively in the apex and base regions. The tumor exhibits extensive, multifocal extraprostatic extension. Areas of\nextraprostatic extension include the right and left posterolateral surface of the prostate, right and left posterior surface of the\nprostate, right and posterior apex, base region anterior to the left seminal vesicle and left superior neurovascular bundle. On the\nleft superior neurovascular bundle, at the site of extraprostatic extension, tumor is present at the inked margin of resection. The\nextent of marginal involvement in this region is less than 1.0 mm. In other regions, carcinoma is present at less than 0.1 mm from\nthe inked margin of resection (posterior apex and bladder neck region). The tumor invades both seminal vesicles including\nextraprostatic portion of the right and left seminal vesicles, and intraprostatic portion of the left seminal vesicle. Involvement of\nperivesicular soft tissue is also present.\nPlease refer to the previous report for the diagnosis of the pelvic lymph nodes.\nGROSS. DESCRIPTION\n(A) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A specimen consisting of a prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles and\nattached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.\nThe prostate gland (4.1 x 3.4 x 3.0 cm, 24 grams ,post-fixation) has the usual shape .The soft tissue present along the left\nposterolateral aspect of the prostate is scant ,but slightly more abundant than along the right side. A nodule is palpated in the left\napex and right side of the prostate .Serial cross sections after fixation demonstrate areas suspicious for tumor in the right side of\nthe two cross sections of the prostate.

The\ndominant tumor focus is located in the left anterolateral, left lateral and left posterolateral peripheral zone with extension into the\nleft transition zone. This tumor focus measures 2.0 x 0.8 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in the two\ncross-sections of the prostate and extensively in the apex and base. In the left superior neurovascular bundle region this tumor\nfocus extends into extraprostatic tissue (6.0 mm). The margins of resection are free of tumor. The second tumor focus is located\nin the right transition zone. This tumor focus measures 1.4 x 1.2 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and is present in two\ncross-sections and extensively in the apex and base. This tumor focus is of lower histologic grade (Gleason score 7/3+4) and\nconfined to the prostate. The margins of resection are free of tumor.\nPlease refer to the previous report for the diagnosis of the pelvic lymph nodes.\nGROSS..

The\ndominant tumor focus and the one of the highest histologic grade is located in the right and left transition zone. This tumor focus\nmeasures 3.0 x 1.5 cm in the largest cross -sectional dimension, and it is present in four cross sections and extensively in the\napical region .This tumor focus exhibits predominately Gleason grades 4 and 3. A minor (tertiary )component of Gleason grade 5\nis also present. This tumor exhibits focal extraprostatic extension (less than 1 .0 mm) in the right anterior surface of the prostate\nand extends to the margin of resection in the anterior apical region. The extent of marginal involvement is 6.0 mm .The two\nperipheral zone foci are located in the left posterolateral and right lateral peripheral zone. The tumor located in the left\nposterolateral peripheral zone measures 0.8 x 0 .4 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension, and it is present in the first cross\nsection of the prostate .The third tumor focus is located in the right lateral peripheral zone. This tumor measures 0.5 x 0.2 cm in\nthe largest cross-sectional dimension ,and it is present in one cross section. The non-dominant tumor foci are of lower histologic\ngrade (Gleason score 6/3 + 3) and are confined to the prostate with negative margins.\nGROSS DESCRIPTION\n(A) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A specimen consisting of a prostate ,attached right and left seminal vesicles and\nattached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.\nThe prostate gland (2.5 x 2. 2 x 4.0 cm ,31 grams ,post fixation )has the usual shape .The soft tissue present along the\nright and left posterolateral aspects of the prostate appears symmetrical .A palpable and visible nodule is observed in the left mid\nregion of the prostate .Serial cross sections after fixation demonstrate firm areas consistent with tumor in the right transition zone\nand right peripheral zone of the first three of the four cross sections of the prostate.\nThe seminal vesicles and segments of vasa deferentia are grossly free of tumor.\nSECTION CODE: Al, A2, base of right seminal vesicle and right vas deferens ;A3, A4, base of left seminal vesicle and\nleft vas deferens ;A5, prostatic base ,right border ;A6, A7 , prostatic base ,right posterior border ;A8, A9, prostatic base ,central\nportion; Al0, prostatic base ,left border ;Al 1, A12, prostatic base ,left posterior border ;A13, A14 , apex anterior ;A15, apex left; Page: 3\nSpecimen Date/Time:\nA16-A18, apex posterior ;A19, apex right ;A20-A35, sections of the four cross sections of the prostate according to specimen\nradiograph.\nThe anterior aspect of the prostate is inked in green ,left surface in red, right surface in yellow and posterior surface in\nblack.\nSNOMED CODES\nT-92000, M-Y1973\nEntire report and diagnosis completed by:\n------END OF REPORT------\nDiagnosis oiscre .-.\nPrimary Tumor SiteDi:creparcy\nDi,p-p.\nPrior Malignancy fl,;tory \"\nDualJStia- ch rono ;rsPn:naryN\n.irclc",

The largest tumor focus although not the one of the highest histologic grade (Gleason score 5/3+2) located in the right and\nleft transition zone. This tumor focus measures 2.7 x 1.3 cm in the largest cross sectional dimension and it is present in four cross\nsections and focally in the apical region. This tumor focus is confined to the prostate and the margins of resection are free of\ntumor. The second tumor focus is located in the left lateral, left posterolateral, left posterior, mid posterior and right posterior\nperipheral zone. This tumor focus measures 2.2 x 1.5 cm in the largest cross sectional dimension and it is present in three cross\nsections, extensively in the apex and focally in the base region. This tumor focus is a high grade carcinoma (Gleason score 4+5)\nand is associated with an increased lymphocytic infiltrate. The tumor focus exhibits extraprostatic extension in the left apex and left\nposterolateral aspect of the prostate. Extraprostatic extension is present in two separate sections and the added length of\nextraprostatic tumor is 9.0 mm. At the site of extraprostatic extension the margins of resection are free of tumor. This tumor focus\nfocally extends to less than 0.1 mm from the margin of resection in the apex. This tumor focus invades the intraprostatic portion of\nthe left seminal vesicle.\nDue to the presence of distortion in areas of the tumor close to the margins of resection in the apex and the presence of a marked\nlymphocytic infiltrate, immunoperoxidase studies for keratin, lymphocyte marker and neuroendocrine differentiation markers were\nperformed. Cytokeratin highlights tumor which is seen focally approaching but not at the margins of r section. The lymphocytic\ninfiltrate is a mixture of both CD20 positive B lymphocytes and CD5 positive T lymphocytes with a pr dominance of the latter. The\ntumor is negative for synaptophysin but a few scattered neoplastic cells are positive for chromograni supporting the presence of\nfocal minimal neuroendocrine differentiation. Page: 4\n(D) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A specimen consisting of a prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles and\nattached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.\nThe prostate gland (4.5 x 2.5 x 4.5 cm, 40 grams, post-fixation) has the usual shape.

Both tumor foci are located in the peripheral zone. The\ndominant tumor focus is located in the left lateral, left posterolateral, left posterior, mid-posterior, right posterior, right posterolateral\nand right lateral peripheral zone. This tumor focus measures 3.8 x 1.8 cm in largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in\nthe two cross-sections of the prostate and extensively in the apex and base. The tumor exhibits extraprostatic extension on the left\nposterolateral surface of the prostate and right and left superior neurovascular bundle regions. The tumor extends to the right\nbladder neck margin of resection. The area of the positive margin is cauterized and the added length of the cauterized margin on\nthe right base is 4.0 mm. The second tumor focus is located in the right anterolateral and right lateral peripheral zone. This tumor\nfocus measures less than 0.1 x less than 0.1 cm in largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in the first cross-section and\nfocally in the apex. The non-dominant tumor focus is of lower histologic grade and confined to the prostate with negative margins.\nGROSS .DESCRIPTION\n(E) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A specimen consisting of a prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles and\nattached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.\nThe prostate gland (5.0 x 2.5 x 4.0 cm, 28.0 grams, post-fixation) has the usual shape.
