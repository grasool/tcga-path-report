        "llm_output": " Site: Multiple sites including left constrictor muscle, soft palate margin, lateral pharyngeal margin, left tongue base margin, posterior tonsillar pillar margin, and left radical tonsillectomy. Justification: The report includes separate descriptions for each specimen received, indicating different surgical margins and the main tumor site.\n\nLaterality: Left side of the oral cavity and oropharynx. Justification: All the sites and specimens mentioned in the report are from the left side, indicating that the surgery was performed on the left side.\n\nHistology: Squamous cell carcinoma. Justification: The report mentions \"in situ carcinoma\" and \"invasive carcinoma,\" which are types of squamous cell carcinoma. Additionally, the tumor cells are strongly positive for p16, indicating a high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, which is commonly associated with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.\n\nStage: Not provided. Justification: The report does not include information about the size of the tumor or the presence of metastasis, which are necessary for determining the stage of the cancer.\n\nGrade: Not provided. Justification: The report does not include information about the differentiation of the tumor cells, which is necessary for determining the grade of the cancer.\n\nBehavior: Malignant. Justification: The report mentions \"in situ carcinoma\" and \"invasive carcinoma,\" indicating that the tumor has the potential to invade surrounding tissues and metastasize, which is characteristic of malignant behavior."

The larynx is opened posteriorly on the midline at the\ntime of frozen section analysis. There are three tracheal rings attached.\nThere is a tan -white appearing mass measuring 2.5 x 1.9 cm in surface area and 2.2 cm in thickness involving the\nglottic larynx. The mass is grossly located on the bilateral false cord, vestibule true cord and crosses the midline.\nThe mass does not appear to involve pyriform sinus. Grossly, the mass extends 2.4 cm from the tip of the epiglottic\nmucosal edge, 2.3 cm from the base of the tongue mucosal edge, 2.4 cm from the lateral right mucosal edge, 1.1 cm\nfrom the lateral left mucosal edge and 3.1 cm from the distal tracheal edge. None of the tracheal rings grossly\nappear involved the mass. On the anterior aspect of the specimen is an ellipse of abnormal skin measuring 4.5 x 4.3\nx 1.0 cm. The inferior aspect of the skin ellipse measures 2.3 cm from the distal tracheal edge. A tan-white, irregular\nulceration is identified measuring 2.2 x 1.7 cm and is present 2.5 cm from the inferior skin edge, 1.6 cm from the left\nskin edge, 1.1 cm from the right skin edge and 0.9 cm from the superior skin edge. The skin defect grossly does not\nappear to communicate with the mass lesion. There is a left lobe of the thyroid gland present. The cut surface is\nhomogenous and beefy red. A colloid nodule measuring 1.3 x 1.1 x 0.5 cm is noted. On sectioning, the lesion\ngrossly invades the anterior commissure as well as the pre-epiglottic space as well as possible full thickness invasion\nof the thyroid cartilage. Sections are taken as listed in the cassette summary after decalcification. Representative\nsection of tumor is submitted for Tumor Bank at the time of frozen section analysis.

Received are 2, irregular, soft to \nrubbery, tan, \n tissue biopsies each measuring 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm.  A touch prep is \nperformed \nwith an intraoperative diagnosis completed. The specimen is entirely \nsubmitted \nfor processing in a cassette labeled 1A.  \nPart 2 is received fresh labeled with the patient's name, initials xx and \n\"right zone 2B node\".  Received is a single, tan, oval, soft to \nrubbery, lymph \nnode measuring 0.5 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm.  The specimen is inked, bisected and \nentirely submitted for processing in a cassette labeled 2A.  \nPart 3 is received fresh labeled with the patient's name, initials xx \nand \n\"right neck level 2, 3, and 4\".  Received is an irregular unoriented 13 \nx 4.5 \nx 1.3 cm right selective neck dissection, presumably lymph node levels \n2 \nthrough 4 without an orienting suture.  Neck dissection is divided \nequally \ninto 3 segments.  The measurements for the lymph node- containing soft \ntissue \nlevels are as follows: Level A- 4.2 X 3.5 X 1.5 cm, level B-  4.3 x 4 x \n1.0 cm, \nand level C-  4 x 3.2 x 1.5 cm.  Multiple lymph nodes, ranging from 0.2 \nto 2.0 \ncm in greatest dimension are identified.  Several of the larger lymph nodes \nappear to be tumor involved and are present in greater numbers within \nlevel A. \n  Lymph nodes are entirely submitted in cassettes labeled: \n3A - level A -  six possible lymph nodes \n3B - level A- six possible lymph nodes \n3C - level A - single bisected lymph node \n3D - level A single bisected lymph node \n3E - level B- seven possible lymph nodes \n3F - level C- 9 possible lymph nodes \nPart 4 is received fresh labeled with the patient's name, initials xx \nand \n\"left neck level 2, 3 and 4\".  Received is an irregular unoriented 11.5 \nx 6 x \n1.2 cm left selective neck dissection, presumably lymph node levels 2 through \n4 without an orienting suture.  Neck dissection is divided equally into \n3 \nsegments.  The measurements for the lymph node- containing soft tissue \nlevels are as follows: Level A- 4.3 X 3.5 X 1.25 cm, level B-  5.5 x 3.1 x 0.8 \ncm, and level C-  4 x 3 x 1.2 cm.  Multiple lymph nodes, ranging from 0.2 to 2.0 \ncm in greatest dimension are identified.  Several of the larger lymph nodes appear \nto be tumor involved and are present in greater numbers within level A.   \nLymph nodes are entirely submitted in cassettes labeled: \n4A - level A -  four possible lymph nodes \n4B - level A-  single possible lymph node \n4C  level B-  seven lymph node  4D  level B - one lymph node \n4E - level C- eight possible lymph nodes \n4F - level C- three possible lymph nodes \nPart 5 is received fresh labeled with the patient's name, initials xx \nand \n\"larynx\".   The specimen consists of total laryngectomy measuring 8.5 cm \n(superior to inferior), by 4.2 cm (anterior to posterior), by 5.8 cm \n(width) \nwhen reconstructed.  The specimen includes the hyoid bone which is \nremoved.  \nThe hyoid bone measures 8.2 cm in length by 0.3 x 0.3 cm in greatest \ndimension.  One tracheal ring is identified.  There is a supraglottic \nirregular exophytic ulcerated mass measuring at least 2.8 x 2.2 cm in \nmaximal \ndimension.  The tumor is centered at the level of the supraglotttis and more \nprominent and cavitary toward the right side.  The tumor appears to \ncompress/invade the right and left false vocal cords as well as the \nanterior \npyriform sinus.  The tumor is grossly located at 1.3 cm from the right arytenoid mucosal margin, 1.8 cm from the left arytenoid margin, 3.0 cm \nfrom \nthe epiglottic margin and at 3.2 cm from the jugular margin (inferior).  \nThe \nanterior soft tissue margin appears intact and no gross lesion is identified.  \nUpon sectioning the tumor measures 4.8 cm superior to inferior by 3.2 cm \nanterior to posterior, by 4.5 cm in width.  It involves the pre-\nepiglottic space, paraglottic space and anterior soft tissue.  The tumor appears \nto \nsuperficially invade the thyroid cartilage as well as epiglottic \ncartilage.  \nThe anterior soft tissue margin including muscle and fibroadipose tissue \nappears uninvolved by tumor.  The right thyroid lobe is identified \nmeasuring \n3.2 x 2.5 x 0.8 cm in greatest dimension.  No parathyroid tissue is \nidentified.  On section no discrete, well circumscribed or ill defined \nlesions \nen.  A section of the tumor was selected and   \n \ni red and banked.  The specimen is submitted in fourteen cassettes as follows: \n5A  epiglottic margin, perpendicular \n5B  tracheal (deep) margin, shaved \n5C  right arytenoid margin, perpendicular \n5D  left arytenoid margin, perpendicular 5E  right anterior soft tissue margin  (area inked blue is not a \nmargin)  \n5F  tumor and thyroid cartilage right side \n5G  supraglottic tumor area right side \n5H  - ventricle tumor area right side \n5I  anterior soft tissue margin left side \n 5J  tumor and epiglottic cartilage \n5K  ventricle tumor area left side \n5L  tumor and thyroid cartilage left side \n5M  5N  representative section of thyroid gland.  \nOn Part 5 cassettes A, B, F, H, J and L will be placed in decalcifying \nl ion. \n/ \n \nONSULTATION: \n1AFS:  RIGHT SUPRAGLOTTIC LESION, BIOPSY (touch prep )- \nA.

        "llm_output": " Site: The specimens are from various sites including the right and left neck dissections, base of tongue, left lateral pharynx, and larynx. This is necessary to examine the extent of the malignancy.\n\nLaterality: The tumors are located on both sides of the body, with one on the right laryngectomy and the other on the glottic segment of the left laryngectomy. This information is crucial for determining the appropriate treatment.\n\nHistology: Both tumors are moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinomas. This type of cancer is common in the head and neck region, and the histological grade helps determine the aggressiveness of the tumor.\n\nStage: The right laryngectomy tumor is staged as pT3 pN2c, indicating a relatively advanced stage of cancer with positive lymph nodes. The left glottic tumor is staged as pT1a pN0, indicating an early-stage cancer without positive lymph nodes.\n\nGrade: Both tumors are moderately differentiated, which suggests an intermediate level of aggressiveness. This information is important for determining the prognosis and appropriate treatment.\n\nBehavior: The behavior of the tumor is malignant, as it is a cancer that can invade surrounding tissues and metastasize to other parts of the body. This information is crucial for determining the appropriate treatment and follow-up care.\n\nNot provided: Other categories such as chemoradiation therapy, organ transplant, immunosuppression, and cytogenetics tests are not provided in the report. These factors can influence the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, and it is important to obtain this information from the medical record or the treating physician."

Part 1 is designated \"right level 1B neck dissection\".  It consists of a  \nsubmandibular gland (3 x 2.5 x 2 cm) and attached fibroadipose tissue (6.5 x  \n4.5 x 2.5 cm).  The cut surface of the gland is tan -white a nd multilobated.  \nFour lymph nodes are identified in the fibroadipose tissue varying in size  \nfrom 1.2 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm to 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm.  Representative sections are  \nsubmitted as follows:  \n1A  submandibular gland  \n1B  one lymph node bisected  \n1C  two lymph  nodes  \n1D  two lymph nodes.  \nPart 2 is designated \"right hemiglossectomy\".  The specimen measures 7 x 6 x  \n 3.5 cm overall.  The lateral surface shows two ulcers measuring 3.5 x 2.5 cm  \n(ulcer #1) and 1.5 x 1 cm (ulcer #2), respectively.  The larger ulcer is 1 cm  \nfrom the anterior margin, 1.4 cm from the dorsal/deep margin and 1.1 cm away  \nfrom the ventral/deep margin.  The smaller ulcer is 0.5 cm away from the  \ndorsal/deep margin and 2.5 cm away from the ventral/deep margin and 0.5 cm  \nfrom the posterior margin.   All the margins were evaluated intraoperatively.  \nOn serial sectioning, the larger ulcer shows a tan white mass (1.2 cm deep).  \nThe smaller ulcer also shows a tan white mass (0.2 cm in depth).  The two  \nmasses grossly appear to be continuous with each othe r.  \nInk code:  \nBlue  ventral/deep  \nGreen  dorsal/deep  \nYellow  anterior  \nOrange  soft palate/posterior  \nRed  area banked.   \nDigital images are taken.

Specimen\nhas a pale tan cut surface. Entirely submitted in Al.\nB)Received in a container of formalin labeled \"..., right neck dissection\"\nis a 10 x 4.8 x 2 cm yellow lobulated portion of fibrofatty tissue. There is\na double suture attached to the level II region and a single suture attached\nto the level IV region. The specimen is sectioned and in the level II region\nthere is a 4.5 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm tan lobulated salivary gland. It is serially\nsectioned and has tan lobulated cut surfaces. No masses or lesions are\nidentified. The specimen is divided into levels II, III, IV, and V. In the\nlevel II region there is a 2 x 2 x 1 cm previously incised tan-gray friable\napparent grossly involved lymph node. The remaining regions are sectioned\nand have fibrofatty cut surfaces and numerous candidate lymph nodes are\nidentified ranging from 0.1-2.5 cm in greatest dimension. No additional\nmetastatic disease is grossly appreciated. Representative sections are\nsubmitted as follows: B1 - salivary gland; B2 - sections of grossly involved\nlevel II lymph node; B3 - two level II bisected lymph nodes, one inked blue;\nB4 - three level III candidate lymph nodes; B5 - seven level IV candidate\nlymph nodes; B6 - one bisected level IV lymph node; B7 - four level V\ncandidate lymph nodes; B8 - four level V candidate lymph nodes; B9 - one\nbisected level V lymph node; B10 - one bisected level V lymph node.\nC)Received fresh designated \"right level V\" is one piece of yellow\nfibrofatty tissue measuring 4 x 2 x 0.5 cm. The specimen is examined for\npotential lymph nodes and seven potential lymph node candidates are\nidentified. The largest candidate is inked black and bisected, and all lymph\nnode candidates are submitted in cassette Cl.\nD)Received fresh designated \"inferior margin\" is a 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm\npiece of whitish red fibrous tissue, which is inked black and entirely\nsubmitted for frozen section analysis, after which it is thawed and submitted\nin cassette\nE)Received fresh designated \"right composite resection, single stitch\nanterior lateral, double stitch posterior medial\" is a 5.8 x 5.2 x 5.4 cm\ncomposite resection including a portion of the bony maxilla with three teeth,\nthe soft tissue lateral to the mandible, and associated soft tissue superior\nto the mandible including a portion of a lower molar (mandibular bone is not\npresent). The buccal surface of the oral cavity, lateral to the teeth, has\nan exophytic, friable lesion which extends along the posterior mucosal\nsurface to the medial aspect of the specimen where it is present medial to\nthe upper and lower teeth. Grossly, this exophytic lesion is at least 2.5 x\n3.5 x 2.5 cm on initial examination. The egdes of the lesion are grossly 0.5\ncm from the posterior mucosal margin, 0.8 cm from the inferior mucosal\nmargin, 0.5 cm from the anterior mucosal margin, and 0.5 cm from the superior\nmucosal margin. On initial gross examination, this lesion does not appear to\nextend through the fibrofatty tissue located lateral to the buccal surface. Using the orientation provided per surgeon (single stitch anterior lateral,\ndouble stitch posterior medial), the mucosal margins are inked in the\nfollowing manner: anterior = blue; superior = black; medial = red; inferior\n= green. The lateral soft tissue margin is inked orange, the inferior soft\ntissue is inked green, the superior soft tissue is inked black, the medial\nsoft tissue is inked red, and the posterior soft tissue margin is inked blue\nover green. Representative shave margins are taken from the inferior and\nanterior mucosal surfaces. The specimen is then cut in a transverse plane,\nseparating the maxilla from the mandibular soft tissue, and each piece is\nserially sectioned. The tumor has a firm white cut surface, with friable\nareas, and grossly extends to within 0.1 mm of the deep inked margin (blue\nover green), within 0.1 cm of the inked medial soft tissue margin (red),\nwithin 0.1 cm of the inked lateral soft tissue margin (orange),and within 0.2\ncm of the inferior soft tissue margin (green). On sectioning, the tumor\nappears larger than on original examination, and measures 4.5 x 4.0 x 2.5 cm.\nThe upper maxillary bone is focally sectioned and has foci suspicious for\nbony involvement; these areas are submitted for decalcification.\nCassette summary: El - representative shave margins from the inferior and\nanterior mucosal margins; E2 - representative perpendicular margins from the\nmedial and superior mucosal margins; E3 - representative sections of neoplasm\nin relationship to deep soft tissue margin; E4 - relationship of neoplasm and\nclosest medial soft tissue margin; E5 - relationship of neoplasm and closest\nlateral soft tissue margin; E6 - relationship of neoplasm and superior soft\ntissue margin; E7 - representative sections of superior upper lateral mucosa\nin relationship to inked mucosal margin; E8 - relationship of neoplasm and\ninferior inked margin; E9-E10 - composite cross section through neoplasm;\nEll- E12 - upper maxillary bone..\nF)Received fresh designated \"buccal tumor\" is one piece of whitish red\nfibrous tissue, 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm.

One side of the specimen is white-tan, somewhat granular and\nfirm. It is probably covered by mucosa. The specimen is serially sectioned perpendicular to the\nmucosal surface. On cut surface there is an ill-defined, pale tan-white, firm nodule 1.5 x 1.2 x 1.5\ncm in greatest dimension. It grossly approaches the deep, inked margin. The specimen is entirely\nsubmitted in cassettes Al-A3. B) Received unfixed designated right modified radical neck\ndissection, double long = level II, double short = level IV is an 18 x 8 x 3 cm in greatest\ndimensions right neck dissection specimen with surgical sutures designating levels II and IV.\nThe specimen is multinodular with multiple grossly positive lymph nodes in levels II and III\nincluding a complex of matted nodes that involves both levels; one node is received cut across. A\n10 x 3 x 1.5 cm portion of sternocleidomastoid muscle is identified on the anterior aspect of the\nspecimen. On the medial aspect of the muscle there is a suture-tied on both ends, 7 cm long x 0.5\ncm in outer diameter vessel (internal jugular vein). Additional portion of a vessel 3 cm long is\npresent in level I lateral to the salivary gland tissue. The salivary gland in level I measures 5 x 3\nx 1 cm and has a smooth tan-pink, lobulated, soft cut surface. The skeletal muscle adjacent to\ngrossly positive lymph nodes in the middle of the specimen, is not involved. The main complex\nof positive nodes measures 7 cm in greatest dimension and as previously described crosses both\nlevels II and III.

The specimen is\nentirely submitted for frozen section consultation and is resubmitted as E 1 FS (?). F) Received\nfresh, labeled \"maxilla, right\", is a right composite resection specimen comprising posterior\nmaxilla-and palatal resection. The specimen is 6.7 cm from anterior to posterior, 4.3 cm from\nmedial to lateral, and 3.5 cm from superior to inferior. The anterior mucosal surface has two\nteeth with silver metal fillings; one is 0.8 cm in greatest dimension, and the other is 1.3 cm in\ngreatest dimension. A 2.7 x 1.4 cm depressed, indurated lesion is immediately posterior to the\nteeth. The lesion has a central 2.2 x 0.6 cm defect consistent with excision of tumor for research.\nThe edge of the lesion is tan-white, dusky, and edematous, and it has a rolled edge. The lesion\nextends 0.3 cm from the nearest lateral mucosal margin, 0.5 cm from the nearest posterior\nmucosal margin, and 1.1 cm from the nearest medial mucosal margin. The anterior mucosal\nmargin is 1.8 cm from the lesion. The remainder of the mucosal surface is tan-pink, smooth and\nglistening. The underlying soft tissue margins consist of tan-yellow, lobulated adipose tissue and\nmaroon-brown possible muscle. No definite tumor is identified at the soft tissue surface. The\nmedial- superior aspect of the specimen has a 3.3 x 1.0 cm mucosal surface consistent with sinus\ncavity; the sinus mucosa is tan-pink, smooth and glistening with areas that are red-brown,\nroughened, and focally hemorrhagic. The specimen is inked as follows: anterior = red, medial\nanterior = black, medial posterior = green, superior = yellow, lateral = orange and posterior =\nblue. The specimen is serially sectioned from anterior to posterior to reveal a 5.2 x 4.1 x 3.5 cm,\ntan-white, poly-lobulated, firm mass which immediately underlies the previously described\nmucosal lesion. The mass appears to abut the posterior, superior, lateral, and medial soft tissue\nmargins. The mass abuts the posterior aspect of the most posterior tooth, and it does not appear\nto extend any farther anteriorly. Representative sections are submitted as follows: Ft - medial\nsinus soft tissue margin; F2, F3 - posterior soft tissue margins, perpendicular; F4-F6 - composite\ncross section of mid posterior plane of the specimen; F7 - anterior bone margin, en face (decal);\nF8-F 10 - composite cross section of mid anterior plane of the specimen (decal).

The report does not mention if the tumor is on the left or right side of the larynx.\n\nHistology: The histologic type is squamous cell carcinoma, conventional. This was determined by the description of the tumor and the histologic grade given as G2.\n\nStage: The pathologic staging (pTNM) is pT4a. This indicates that the tumor has grown into nearby tissues, such as the thyroid or tongue muscles, and/or into the larynx's outer covering.\n\nGrade: The histologic grade is G2, which means the cancer cells are moderately differentiated from normal cells. This was determined by the description of the tumor and the histologic grade given as G2.\n\nBehavior: The behavior of this tumor is malignant, meaning it invades nearby tissues and can spread to other parts of the body. This is inherent in the definition of cancer."

Site: The primary tumor location is not explicitly mentioned, but it seems to be a solid tumor involving an organ (possibly gastrointestinal or genitourinary based on some of the lab data).\n2. Laterality: Not provided.\n3. Histology: The histological type of the tumor is also not explicitly stated, but there are references to various cell types and patterns such as squamous, glandular, round cells, fibroblasts, and others.\n4. Stage: Based on the available lab data and diagnostic studies, it appears that the tumor has metastasized (pT3 N1 M1 stage). However, this information is incomplete and should be confirmed with additional clinical and pathological data.\n5. Grade: The grade of the tumor is not provided, but there are references to nuclear appearance, mitotic activity, and cellular differentiation which could be used to determine the grade if more specific information were available.\n6. Behavior: Given the presence of metastasis, this tumor is behaving aggressively (malignant).\n\nIt's important to note that a definitive diagnosis cannot be made with the provided incomplete form, and additional clinical and pathological data would be necessary for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan."
