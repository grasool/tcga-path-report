Focally, in one residual bronchus , an area of in \nsitu adenocarcinoma is identified. In addition , some subpleural \nfibrosis is present suggesting that this is a primary adenocarcinoma \nas opposed to a metastatic adenocarcinoma. A panel of \nimmunohistochemical stains is performed including CK7, CK20, CDX2, \nand TTF1 (with appropriate positive and negative controls). The \nneoplastic cells are strongly positive for CK7. The neoplastic \ncells demonstrate some scattered focal positive stain for CK20. The \nneoplastic cells demonstrate focal weakly positive staining TTF1. \nIn addition, the neoplastic cells demonstrate a rare focal positive \nstaining cell for CDX2. \nThis demonstrates a well differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma. \nThe subpleural fibrosis would suggest this represents a primary lung \nneoplasm, however, the immunohistochemical stains are equivocal and \ntherefore the possibility of a metastatic lesion cannot be fully \nexcluded on histologic grounds alone.

Below the hilum there is a finn tumour which measures 68 x 65 mm in \nmaximal dimension and has a finn sclerotic cut surface. Towards the superior aspect of this there is a \nfinn node which is adherent to the medial aspect of the tumour. Further enlarged nodes are present \nsurrounding the inferior aspect of the bronchial resection margin and pulmonary artery. The tumour \nabuts the pleural surface on this medial aspect but appears clear of the lateral aspect by approximately \n10 mm. On sectioning there are areas of necrosis and the tumour has a sclerotic cut face. Elsewhere \nthere is apical scarring. Distal to the tumour there is evidence of obstructive pneumonitis and in the \nbasal aspect of the lung there is a finn grey nodule.

[Blocked in toto, SA] \nMICROSCOPIC \nI: Sections show a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Patchy necrosis is present. \nVascular invasion is presenl but the pulmonary artery is clear of malignancy. No pleural, lymphatic or \nperineura l invasion is identified. The bronchial resection margin is clear of malignancy and shows no \nevidence of squamous metaplasia or dysplasia. Obstructive pneumonitis is confinned adjacent to the \ntumour. A way from the tumour there are at least three further distinct lesions. The first is the nodule \nnoted in the lower zone which comprises granulomatous inflammation including numerous giant cells \nof Langhans type with surround ing lymphocytic infiltration and fibrosis. A few tiny foci of necrosis \nare present within this nodule. There are [wo further foci of granulomatous inflammation with \nextensive central necrotic debris surrounded by foamy macrophag es and fibrosis. These appear to be \ncentred on bronchi. No organisms are identified in any of these lesions with Grocott or ZN stains. \nHowever the appearances are highly suspicious for infection, and I note that atypical Mycobacteria \nhave been found previously in sputum. The peribronchial lymph nodes are confmned to contain \nmetastatic squamous cell carcinoma, and they also have foci of fibrosis and dystrophic calcification, \nbut they show no evidence of granulomatous inflamma tion. \n2: Sections of the pulmonary artery show no evidence of malignancy . \n3: Sections of the lymph node show multiple silicotic nodules together with extensive sheets of \npigmented macrophages but there is no evidence of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma. \n4: Sections show lymph nodes with a follicular hyperplasia, sinus histiocytosis and aggregates of \npigmented macrophages.

The neoplastic cells have prominent \nnucleoli, and do not have the cytologic appearance of small \ncell carcinoma, grade II neuroendocrine carcinoma (atypical \ncarcinoid) or large cell neuroendocrine carCinoma. \nImmunohistochemical stains are performed. The neoplasm \nstains positively for cytokeratin CK7 as well as forTTF-1. \nThe neoplasm is negative for CK20, high molecular weight \nkeratin SK and p63. The findings support the diagnosis of .-\n_gdenocarcinoma of lung primary. There is weak staining for \nsynaptophysin. It 1s felt 1n that this is an example of \nnon-neuroendocrine carcinoma {adenocarcinoma) that shows \npositive staining for synaptophysin, and that it should not \nresult in classification of a neuroendocrine tumor. \nCurrent NCCN practice guidelines recommend determination of \nEGFR and KRAS mutation status in adenocarcinoma of lung to \nhelp select patients for Tyrosine-Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) \ntherapy. EGFR-activating mutations have been shown to be \nsignificantly associated with response to TKis and KRAS \nmutations are associated with TKI resistance. They are \nmutually exclusive in NSCLC. Additionally, recent data show \nthat ALK (Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase) gene rearrangements in \nadenocarcinoma of lung are associated with resistance to \nTKis and have favorable response rates to Crizotinib, the \nALK inhibitor agent currently in clinical trials. Mutation \nanalysis for KRAS and EGFR-TK domain and ALK gene \nrearrangement by FISH is available as the Lung Cancer \nMutation Panel. Testing may be performed on \nparaffin-embedded tissue from the primary or metastatic \ntumor or pleural fluid cell block.

Received fresh in a container labeled \"right upper \nlobe\" is a 296 gm, 17.8 x 11.8 x 4 em, lung lobe compatible \nwith right upper lobe. In the hilar region there is an 0.8 em long \nand 1.5 em in diameter bronchial stump which is grossly \nunremarkable. The vessels at the margin are also grossly \nunremarkable. There are some tan-gray lymph nodes up to 1.2 em in \ngreatest dimension in the hilar region. The pleural surface is \npink-purple with some anthracotic pigment deposition. There .is some \nretraction of the pleural surface. The specimen is sectioned, and \nthere is a 2.6 x 2 x 1.8 em rubbery tan-white mass underlying the \narea with pleural retraction1 with the mass suggestive of invading \nthe pleura. Approximately 2 em from this mass is a separate 4 x 3.5 \nx 3.1 ern rubbery tan-white mass. This mass approaches at least near \nto the pleural surface. The larger lesion has yellow-orange \ndiscoloration surrounding it, suggestive of surrounding pneumonia. \nThe remainder of the parenchyma is spongy and red-purple without \naddi tiona! lesions. RS-13, follmving fixation. \nBLOCK SUt~1ARY: Al -bronchial margini A2 -vascular margin; A3-A5 -\nfirst lesion described; A6-A9 -larger lesioni AlO -parenchyma \nsurrounding larger lesioni All-random lungi Al2 -two hilar lymph \nnodes; A13 -bisected hilar lymph node. \nGROSS DESCRIPTION \nB. Received fresh in a container labeled \"level 11\" are \ntwo pieces of soft red-gray tissue, 0.7 em in greatest \naggregate dimension. AS-1, following fixation. \nC. Received fresh in a container labeled \"2R\" are four \npieces of soft red-gray tissue, 3 em in greatest aggregate \ndimension. AS-2, following fixation. \nD. Received fresh in a container labeled \"4R\" are multiple \nsimilar fragments of tissue, in aggregate 2.7 x 1 x 0.5 em. \nAS-3, following fixation. \nE. Received fresh in a container labeled \"level 7\" is a \nsimilar portion of tissue, 1.5 em in greatest dimension. \nAS-2, following fixation. \nMICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION \nThe follm'ling template surrunarizes the findings in this \ncase: \nHistologic type: Both of the mass lesions consist of poorly \ndifferentiated non-small cell carcinoma. There are areas that it is \nfavored have squamous differentiation, as well as less frequent \nfoci suggestive of glandular differentiation (adenocarcinoma). \nAlthough not entirely identical, the two lesions look similar. \nHistologic grade: Poorly differentiated \nPrimary tumor (pT): These two lesions are grossly 2.6 em and 4 em \nin greatest dimension. The 2.6 em in diameter lesion has visceral \n pleural invasion, with the larger lesion extending very \nperipherally but without definite visceral pleural invasion. \nAlthough it is difficult to definitely distinguish between \nsynchronous primaries and the two masses being part of the same \nprocess, given the similarities in appearance, based on the new \nguidelines, two nodules of similar histology in the same lobe \nMICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION \nwould be classified as pT3, Clinical correlation is recommended. \nMargins of resection: The bronchial and vascular resection margins \nare negative. \nDirect extension of tumor: Visceral pleural extension for the 2.6 \nem in diameter lesion, no direct extension identified for the larger \nlesion. \nVascular invasion: Not definitively identified. \nRegional lymph nodes (pN): pNl. There is metastatic carcinoma in \none of three hilar lymph nodes in part A. The separately submitted \nlymph nodes in parts B, c, D, and E are negative for malignancy. \nDistant metastasis {pM} : pMX \nOther findings: There are inflammatory changes surrounding the \ntumors, with focally prominent pneumonia surrounding the larger \nlesion. \nNote: This case has been reviewed in Intradepartmental consultation \nwith all reviewers interpreting the two mass lesions as similar in \nappearance. \n3,4x3,5 \nDIAGNOSIS \nA.

The analytical sensitivity of\nthe assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low\npercentage of cells may not be detected.\nThis test is validated for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and\ncodon 13 mutations in fresh, frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin\nembedded tissue. In particular the test performance has been\nestablished in samples of colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung\ncarcinoma which harbor these mutations, although several other\ntissues are also known to harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of\npancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix, etc.).\nMETHOD/LIMITATIONS:\nTissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is\nselected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample ,quantified\nand amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to\nexon 2 of the KRAS gene .PCR products are subjected to single\nnucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;\nprimer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel\nelectrophoresis and fluorescence detection .False positive or\nnegative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants\nor somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.\nREFERENCES:\nNSCLC\nMascaux C, lannino N, et al.

Electronically signed by:\nDate:\nAddendum #1 performed by\nADDENDUM #2:\nINTEGRATED ONCOLOGY\nEGFR Mutation Analysis\nReferring Physician: .\nBody Site: Lung\nClinical Data :Adenocarcinoma\nRESULTS: No mutation detected.\nINTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified in the sample provided\nfor analysis .Fewer than 5% of non -small cell lung carcinoma\npatients without identifiable mutations are reported to be\nresponsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies. COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more tumor cellularity is optimal\nfor this mutation analysis .The sample submitted showed 80% tumor\ncellularity upon pathologist review.\nA frequently occurring sequence change 2361 G>A (Q787Q) was\nidentified. This polymorphism is known not to have clinical\nsignificance.\nMutations in the tyrosine domain of the epidermal growth factor\nreceptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with differential\nresponsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)\ntherapies. The objective response rate among patients with a\nsensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%.\nThis assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain;\nbased on the current literature, most mutations in non -small-cell\nlung carcinoma (NSCLC) are expected to occur in these exons.\nMutations present in less than 10-20% of extracted DNA may not be\ndetected by this method. Mutation status in a sample may change\nduring tumor progression or the course of therapy; therefore, this\nresult cannot be used to infer the presence or absence of a mutation\nin another sample or sub -sample obtained from this tumor.\nThis test is validated for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The\nclinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types\nis unknown.\nMETHOD/LIMITATION:\nTissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is\nselected for analysis .DNA is isolated from the samples, quantified\nand amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to\nexons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by\nbi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary gel\nelectrophoresis and fluorescence detection .False positive or\nnegative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants\nor somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.\nREFERENCES:\n1.Azzoli CG, et al, J.

C34.3 M 8255/3 G3.  \nComment/supplementary remark:   \nWithin the main tumor and the lymph node metastases, which are found within the lung in the \nparabronchial region, at the hilus and in sample 5, the large-cell solid tumor component, which has a partly clear -cell character, is predominant. Especially in the area of the main \ntumor margin and the surrounding area the carcinoma shows glandular tubulopapillary and bronchioloalveolar differentiation. No maturation pattern of squamous epithelium is evident on conventional histology (immunohistochemical analysis will follow to provide as definitive confirmation as possible of the bronchopulmonary origin of the tumor and thus exclusion of a late metastatic spread of the reported breast carcinoma). The RX category is explained by the fact that the tumor infiltrating the pleura and disseminated there extends as far as the pleural surface and, with the detection of carcinoma cells in the pleural effusions, the possibility cannot be excluded that some of them remained there. The central bronchus resection line and the resection margins of the large pulmonary vessels and the resection pr eparation of parietal \npleura itself, as registered under 4., are tumor- free \n  Result of immunohistochemical analysis: a major part of the tumor cells with double expression of low and high molecular weight keratins (M903 and 902). In the glandular differen tiation component, tumor cell nuclei are positive TTF1.  \n The immune profile confirms the diagnosis of an adenocarcinoma of the lung of mixed differentiation.  \n  \n",

However, based on the procedures performed (bronchoscopy and thoracoscopy), it could be a lung cancer or another type of lung mass.\n\nStage: The stage is not provided in the text, as it would require additional information such as the size of the mass and whether it has spread to nearby lymph nodes or other organs.\n\nGrade: The grade is also not provided in the given text. Grade refers to how abnormal the cancer cells look under a microscope and how quickly the cancer is likely to grow and spread.\n\nBehavior: The behavior of the mass cannot be determined without more information, such as whether it is benign or malignant.\n\nJustification for the choices: The site, laterality, stage, grade, and behavior are not explicitly provided in the text, and the histology can only be inferred based on the procedures performed.

Part A is submitted fresh for tissue procurement, \n             labeled \"lingula\".  It consists of an elongated portion of \n    lung tissue, measuring 18 x 4 x 2 cm. maximally.  It has been \n    amputated along an entire edge, which has steel clips and paper tape \n    present.  There is an area of pleural puckering opposite the tape, \n    which has drawn the pleura into a stellate- like area, with a \n    palpable mass deep to that.  The pleura is focally torn along \n    another portion of the specimen.  Black ink is applied over the area \n    of the scar and then the specimen is serially sectioned.  This \n    reveals the presence of a nodular tumor mass immediately beneath the \n    pleura, in the region of the above- mentioned scar.  That tumor mass \n    measures maximally 2 x 1.5 x 1.3 cm.  Sections through the remaining \n    pulmonary parenchyma reveal a consolidated bloody red tissue, \n    without other focal nodules present.  There is some adherent fat \n    present on the pleural surface.  Representative tumor and normal \n    ions are submitted for tissue procurement, per request of \n      Sections after fixation. \n      Part B is submitted fresh, labeled \"Level 10 lymph \n             node\".

Collection \nE. EML41ALK rearrangement NOT identified (see In Situ Procedure). \nNote: \nKRAS codon 12/13 mutations are found in approximately 10-30% lung adenoyarclnomas and associated with history of \nsmoking, The presence of KRAS mutation leads to resistance to EGFR ~ therapies (1). EGFR exon 19 and 21 \nmutations are present in about 10% of  and up to 40% in th..-,opulation, common in and \nassociated \nwith the clinical response to treatment with EGFR inhibitors (2). These mutations are mutually exciusive and \ntheir presence may have prognostic andlor therapeutic implications (3,4). Clinical studies show high EGFR gene copy \nnumber by FISH analysis (amplification) to be associated with favorable clinical benefit (clinical response, stable disease, \ntime to progression, and survival) In patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase \ninhibitors. \nApproximately 3% of lung adenocarcinomas within the Asian population have an interstitial deletion and inversion in \nchromosome 2p resulting in the EML4IALK fusion gene (ALK+) which is sensitive to AlK inhibitors (5,6). The prevalence \nof this abnormality in the Western population is stili unknown, Detection of this abnormality is critical for identifying \npatients eligible for therapies that target ALK enzymatic activity. EML41ALK rearrangements are mutually exclusive with \nKRAS and EGFR mutations. \nFINAL DIAGNOSIS: \nSUMMARY STATEMENT \nThe posterior segmentectomy demonstrates a 2.5 cm poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma associated with \nangiolymphatic and parietal pleural invasion. Metastatic adenocarcinoma is present in posterior and apical segment \nlevel 11, level 10 and level 5 lymph nodes. Surgical resection margins are free of tumor.

C34.2 M8255/3.  \nComment/supplementary remark:   \nThe tumor classification as adenocarcinoma of the lung showing a predominantl y \ntubulopapillary structural pattern still requires confirmation by appropriate \nimmunohistochemical analysis. The classification of the second small tumor focus as a (hematogenous) metastasis that \u2013 despite a certain difference in histoarchitecture and cel l \nmorphology in places \u2013 is based on the structure of the focus, which is lacking the fibrous remodeling or cicatricial zone here that is characteristic of a primary peripheral bronchopulmonary carcinoma. Vascular invasion can be seen in the intratumoral, thick -walled \npulmonary vessels of the larger tumor, where there is tumor spread with endobronchial occlusion in a subsegmental branch of the bronchus. The R1 classification is explained by the observation that the tumor glands invading the pleura extend as far as the outer surface of the pleura in places and the tumor cells thus remain in the pleural space.    Result of immunohistochemical analysis (both tumor foci)  \nCK7 positive throughout, CK20 negative. TTF1.positive (in the smaller focus more than in the larger one), only isolated tumor cells with delicate cell membrane staining for surfactant protein B.  This not only confirms that it is an adenocarcinoma of the lung and, but also supports the view that the smaller focus represents the metastasis of the larger focus  \nseen in 1.) and classified as primary tumor.  \n",

The report describes a tumor in the right upper lobe, which was identified as squamous cell carcinoma, keratinizing type, and moderately differentiated (G2). The stage was determined to be pT2aN0MX based on the size of the tumor (>3 em but <= 5 em), the absence of regional lymph node metastasis, and the inability to assess distant metastasis.

No preoperative tissue diagnosis . \nMACROSCOPIC \nOne specimen submitted. \nThe specimen is labelled 'left upper lobe wedge resection' and consists of a wedge oflung tissue, 130 x \n70 x 30 mm. The specimen bears a line of staples 110 mm in length. Protruding from one aspect of \nthe pleural surface is a palpable mass. The pleura is free and mobile over the mass. 35 mm away from \nthis lesion is a firm pleural plaque, 30 mm in diameter. Elsewhere the pleura shows some irregular \ngrey and white discolouration. Serial slicing reveals a well defined yellowish white tumour mass, 25 \nmm in greatest diameter, approximately 2 mm deep to the pleura. The cut surface shows small areas of \nyellowish necrosis. The tumour is at least 25 mm clear of the stapled surgical margin. No other lesions \nare identified. The uninvolved lung shows severe emphysema. The mass lesion has been sampled for \nMicrobiology and for  [IA-IB tumour with overlying pleura; lC-ID pleural _iir decalcification; IE-IF uninvolved lung parenchyma.] \nMICROSCOPY \nSections reveal a peripherally located moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma demonstrating \npredominantly acinar and focal solid architecture. The tumour is positive for CK7 and TTFI and \nnegative for CK20. Zones of geographic necrosis are evident within the confines of the tumour. The \ntumour does not involve the pleura and is macroscopically clear of the intraparenchyma l stapled \nmargin. No lymphatic or vascular invasion is identified and no perineural permeation by tumour is \nseen.

Part one is labeled 'right middle lobe nodule'. It consists of a\nwedge shaped portion of lung measuring 11 x 5 x 2 cm. There is a\nstaple line identified on the specimen, measuring 10 cm in length.\nThere is a cut identified on the specimen measuring 1.5 cm in\nlength. On further sectioning there is a gray white ill defined area\nmeasuring 1.1 x 1 cm is identified. This area is 0.3 cm from the\nstaple line and 0.4 cm from the pleural surface. The staple line is\ninked blue. Further sectioning of the lung reveals spongy tan maroon\nparenchyma. One portion from the ill defined area is submitted for\nfrozen section analysis. Representative sections are submitted.\n2. Part two is labeled 'station #9 lymph node'. It consists of a\nsingle lymph node measuring 2.4 x 1.5 x 1 cm. The cut surface is\ngrey-black. Entirely submitted in one cassette.\n3. Part three is labeled 'station #10 lymph node'. It consists of\nmultiple irregular fragments of grey-black lymph nodes measuring 1.5\nx 0.8 x 0.5 cm in aggregate. Entirely submitted in one cassette.\n4. Part four is labeled 'completion of right middle lobectomy'. It\nconsists of a lobe of lung measuring 10.5 x 5.5 x 2 cm and weighing\n38 grams. Two staple lines, measuring 8 cm and 6 cm in length are\nnoted. The bronchial and vascular margins are identified. The\nserosal surface is grey-purple and shows a subpleural grey-black\nnodule measuring 0.9 x 0.8 cm. Sectioning reveals an unremarkable red beefy lung parenchyma. The subpleural nodule likely represents\nthe lymph node. No discrete mass lesions are noted. Representative\nsections are submitted.\n5. Part five is labeled 'station #4 lymph node'.

The pathologist whose\nsignature appears below reviewed the original pathology report,\nexamined candidate H&E slides, and selected block 1 A appropriate to\nthe specifications of the ordered molecular analysis. xl H&E and x9\nunstained slides were prepared and forwarded to\nwhere the subject molecular test will be performed. An\naddendum report will be issued when the results.of this molecular\ntest are available.\nAddendum #1performed by\nADDENDUM #2:\nMOLECULAR ONCOLOGY\nKRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS\nReferring Physician\nBody Site :Right middle lobe of lung\nSpecimen Type: Slides\nClinical Data :Adenocarcinoma\nRESULTS: Wild-type gene.\nINTERPRETATION:\nNo mutations were identified at codons 12 and 13 of the KRAS gene.\nCOMMENT:\nMutations in the KRAS gene are reported to be associated with poor prognosis ,and resistance to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor\ntherapies in patients with non -small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). KRAS\nmutations occur in 15-30% of NSCLC patients and are strongly\nassociated with adenocarcinoma and smoking history.\nThis assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;\nbased on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are\nexpected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of\nthe assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low\npercentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated\nfor use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and codon 13 mutations in\nfresh, frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue. In\nparticular the test performance has been established in samples of\ncolorectal cancer and non-small cell lung carcinoma which harbor\nthese mutations, although several other tissues are also known to\nharbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of pancreas, bile duct, ovary,\nappendix, etc.).\nAnalysis of EGFR mutation or gene amplification status may provide\nadditional information regarding this patient's probability of\nresponse to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies, if\nclinically indicated. See references.\nMETHOD/LIMITATION:\nTissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is\nselected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified\nand amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to\nexon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single\nnucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;\nprimer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel\nelectrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or\nnegative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants\nor somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.\nREFERENCES:\nNSCLC\nMascaux C, lannino N, et al.

COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more tumor cellularity is optimal\nfor this mutation analysis. The sample submitted showed 70% tumor\ncellularity upon pathologist review.\nA frequently occurring sequence change 2361>GA (Q787Q) was\nidentified .This polymorphism is known not to have clinical\nsignificance.\nMutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth\nfactor receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with\ndifferential responsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase\ninhibitor (TKI) therapies. The objective response rate among\npatients with a sensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%.\nThis assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain;\nbased on the current literature ,most mutations in non -small-cell\nlung carcinoma (NSCLC) are expected to occur in these exons.\nMutations present in less than 10-20 %of extracted DNA may not be\ndetected by this method .Mutation status in a sample may change\nduring tumor progression or the course of therapy; therefore, this\nresult cannot be used to infer the presence or absence of a mutation\nin another sample or sub-sample obtained from this tumor.\nThis test is validated for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The\nclinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types\nis unknown.\nMETHOD:\nTissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is\nselected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified\nand amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to\nexons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by\nbi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary gel\nelectrophoresis and fluorescence detection.

When a rearrangement involving ALK is\npresent, either inversion or translocation, one of the two fusion\nsignals separates as one red and one green signal. In this\nspecimen, separated signals were present in 0% of the nuclei scored.\nThis result is within the normal limits.\nCOMMENTS: Three to four copies of ALK were observed in 26.0% of\ncells. This gain of intact ALK fusion hybridization signals\nrepresents an aneuploid population with extra copies of chromosome\n2/2p ALK region .Additional copies of ALK are not uncommon in\nNSCLCs, although the significance of extra copies of the ALK gene in\nlung carcinoma is unclear at this time (Salido M. et al.

Fibrinous chronic granulating and fibrosing visceral (sample 1.)) \nand parietal pleuritis (sample 2.)). Uncharacteristic chronic, predominantly interstitial inflammation and fibrosis \nassociated with focal fibrous and small honeycomb-like parenchyma remodeling along the ventrobasalmargin \nof 88.

Left lung submitted fresh for tissue procurement \n             labelled \"left lung\" is an intact lung with two lobes \n    weighing 442 grams.  There is a suture line present at the \n    amputation point of the main left bronchus, the left main pulmonary \n    artery and main left pulmonary vein.  The pleural surface of the \n    lung is intact with a finely stippled anthracotic pigment present. \n    No obvious areas of puckering of the pleura or umbilication are \n    evident.  Several small possible peribronchial lymph nodes are \n    present adjacent to the bronchial stump.  There is a mass that is \n    palpable in the interlobar fissure.  This appears to be below the \n    surface of the lung.  Sections are placed through the mass and this \n    reveals a large tumor mass which is immediately inferior to the main \n    bronchus.  The tumor mass measures maximally 6 x 5 x 4 cm.  It \n    arises approximately 1 cm below the bronchial cuff margin that \n    grossly does not appear to be involved by tumor.  There does appear \n    to be at least one lymph node which is partially involved by tumor \n    adjacent the bronchus.  Portions of the t ormal lung are \n    submitted for procurement per request of   Further \n    sectioning of the lung reveals a second t present deep to \n    the pleural surface of the lower lobe.  This pleural mass as central \n    necrosis and measures maximally 3 x 2 x 1.5 cm.  It has the same \n    fleshy  tan- white gritty cut surface as does the main tumor mass. \n    The upper lobe does not appear to have any discrete nodules.  It is \n    crepitant gray- tan tissue without focal nodularity.  Sections after \n    fixation. \n    BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 - bronchial margin; 2 - vascular margin; 3 - \n    pleural margin of the main dominant tumor mass; 4- 7 - dominant tumor \n    mass; 8-10 - secondary smaller tumor including pleural surface; 11 - \n    random left upper lobe; 12 - random left lower lobe; 13- 14 - \n    bronchial lymph nodes. \n \n     \n \nMICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION \n             Microscopic sections of both lesions present in the left \n             lung have a similar histologic appearance.  Both are \n    moderate to poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas with cells \n    exhibiting prominent eosinophilic cytoplasm.  It is not clear from \n    the histology if this represents two separate primary tumors or an \n    intrapulmonary metastasis from the main lung tumor.  Results of the \n    evaluation of the lung are summarized in the following template: \n \n    Histologic type:  Adenocarcinoma. \n    Histologic grade:  Moderate to poorly differentiated. \n    Primary tumor (pT):  Two lesions are present.  The larger lesion \n    measures 6 x 5 x 4 cm., the smaller lesion 3 x 2 x 1.5 cm. (pT2). \n    Margins of resection:  Bronchial and vascular margins of resection \n    are free of tumor.  Visceral pleural surface free of tumor. \n    Direct extension of tumor:  Absent. \n    Venous (large vessel) invasion:  Negative. \n    Arterial (large vessel) invasion:  Negative. \n    Lymphatic (small vessel) invasion:  Negative. \n    Regional lymph nodes (pN):  Two of six bronchial lymph nodes contain \n    metastatic adenocarcinoma (2/6).  All mediastinal lymph nodes are \n       negative (pN1). \n    Distant metastasis (pM):  Cannot be assessed (pMX). \n \n    5, 3x6, 14x2 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \nDIAGNOSIS \n    A.

Hilar LN (station 10) right: 2.5 em fatty specimen with 2 nodes, 2.5 and 1.2 em, section surface of larger \ngrayish-black and of smaller pale reddish node with 5 mm whitish focus. \n1.) Right middle lobe: inflated, frxed bilobectomy preparation measuring 18 x 16 em, up to 17 em high. Central \nbronchus resection plane located I em proximal to the division into the lobe bronchi. At the hilus two black \nnodes, 1.2 em and 0.9 em in size. Dorsal to the intermediate bronchus a staple suture line runs 7.5 em in a \ncranial direction to the apex of the lower lobe, and a second staple suture line mns 10 em from the hilus along \nthe cranial margin of the middle lobe. Lateral pleura over S4 shows a star-shaped area of retraction measuring \n2.5 em, with a pale brown discoloration in the marginal region, under this a tumor, max. 6.5 em in size, with a \npolycyclic demarcation, obstructing the middle lobe bronchus in the proximal sections and extending to within \n1.5 em of the bronchus resection margin. Spread to the pleura in the area of its retraction, section surfaces pale \nbrown to gray, partly with blackish pigmentation. Mucosa in the region of the ostium of the middle lobe \nbronchus and the adjoining intermediate bronchus extending irregularly to the resection margin. Lung \nparenchyma of remaining middle lobe and lower lobe inconspicuous. \n3.) Bronchial sleeve: 2 em segment of bronchus with 2 em resection margin to the main bronchus (line marked) \nand 1.1 em resection margin tot he upper lobe bronchus. Distal end closed by metal staple suture. \n4.) Upper and middle lobes: two 2 em irregular black nodes or node parts. \n5.) Lobar LN (station 12) right: I em node. \n6.) Hilar LN (station 10) right: 8 mm node with sunounding tissue. \n7.) Pulmonary ligament LN (station 9) right: three node between 0.5 and I em with surrounding tissue \n8.)

Resection margin to main bronchus tangential, resection margin to upper lobe bronchus tangential, cross\u00ad\nsection close to distal resection margin, \n4.)-7.) All material (in 4. -6. halved in each case), \n15 blocks, partly Elastica-van Gieson, PAS, diastase-PAS. \n Microscopy \nRe 1.) Immediate intraoperative evaluation ): metastasis of squamous cell carcinoma. \nAfter paraffin embedding. \nLymph node sections with extensive infiltration by atypical epithelia arranged in differing sizes of partly \nbranched and vaguely epidennoid or concentrically layered solid structures. Moderately wide to wide, pale to \nmoderately eosinophilic cytoplasm. Focally recognizable intercellular bridges. Nuclei round to oval, partly with \nsomewhat inegular contours, mostly moderately, but focally also markedly anisomorphic, with enlarged \nchromatin, differing sizes of nucleoli and numerous mitoses. Surrounding desmoplastic stroma. Small focal \ninclusion of necrosis. \nRe 2.) Immediate intraoperative evaluation ): squamous cell dysplasia up to severity of a squamous \ncell carcinoma in situ with spread to bronchial glands, no evidence of invasive growth rapid sections. \nAfter paraffin embedding. \nTumor made up of atypical epithelia described in 1.). Focal dyskeratoses or vague pearly bead formation. \nIsolated nuclei also deformed. Multifocal necroses of differing extent. Middle lobe bronchus segmentally \nobstructed by the tumor and in large pa1ts destroyed, here continuous infiltration of para bronchial lymph nodes. \nSpread to the visceral pleura, which is markedly enlarged by fibrosis in parts, but not unequivocally infiltrated. \nIn many places invasion of small blood vessels in the tumor and tumor margin. Proximal to the tumor \nobstruction in the middle lobe bronchus and also at the bronchus resection margin partial replacement of the \nrespiratory epithelium by enlarged atypical squamous epithelium extending to the secretory ducts and bronchial \nglands with the squamous disorder mostly reaching well into the upper third or to the surface. Nuclei irregularly \narranged, in most cases slightly to moderately anisomorphic, but with foci of relatively marked anisomorphism, \nand formation here and there of keratin lamellae and pearly beads. Vessel resection margins and hilar lymph \nnodes tumor-free. In S5 incompletely inflated alveolar lung tissue in parts with relatively extensive intraalveolar \nerythrocyte extravasates. \nOtherwise in many places the alveolar lumina and partly also the lumina of bronchioles are occupied with \nmoderately dense macrophages, some transformed into foam cells, some pale brown and with frne granular \nblackish pigmentation. In multifocal parabronchial vessels and in interlobular septa lymph follicles and small \npatches of relatively dense lymphomonocytic infiltrates. In SIO mostly only a few intraalveolar macrophages. \nRe 3.) Immediate intraoperative evaluation (  resection margin to main bronchus + upper lobe \nbronchus in each case tumor-free and free of dysplastic epithelial lesions. \nAfter paraffin embedding: \nBronchial sections with focal replacement of respiratory epithelium by immature squamous epithelium at the \nmargin to the main and upper lobe bronchus. Stroma with increase in elastic fibers. To some extent somewhat \nprominent seromucous glands. Strands of typical hyaline cartilage. Close to the distal resection margin only \nsections of atypical squamous epithelium preserved or registered at the surface as described under 2.), here \nlikewise focal spread in glandular ducts. \nRe 4.) -7.) Lymph nodes with intact basic structure, inconspicuous lymphatic cell content with formation of \nactivated follicles and slight to moderate deposits of blackish granular pigment and some small anisotropic \nparticles within macrophages. \nEVALUATION \nPrimary diagnosis/diagnoses: relatively large, central to peripheral bronchopuhnonary, histologically \nmoderately differentiated, large-cell, slightly keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma of the middle lobe. \nTNM classification pT2 pNJ. VI RO, stage IIB. \nC 34.2 M 8070/3 \nSecondary diagnosis/diagnoses: slight chronic retention pneumonia peripheral to the tumor in S5. Lymph \nnodes with uncharacteristic reactive lesions and anthracotic pigment deposits (samples 2.) and 4.)-7.)). \nRemark/addendum: the tumor shows obliterative segmental growth in the middle lobe bronchus and has \nspread to the mucosal surface right to the central bronchus resection line of sample 2.) and to the distal sections \nof repeat bronchial resection material in sample 3.). The resection margin tot he main and upper lobe bronchus \nof sample 3.) is free of dysplastic epithelial changes. Lymph node metastases are seen in sample 1.) and \nparabronchially in sample 2. ). The other lymph nodes removed and the vessel resection margins of the main \npreparation are tumor-free. An unequivocal infiltration of the visceral pleura cannot be demonstrated. \n",

But in view of the presentation of the tumor and the partial bronchioloalveolar differentiation, the interpretation can be just as easily be supported or perhaps even f avored \nthat this is a primary multifocal tumor manifestation. This would correspond to pT2(m). The stage grouping IIIB thus competes with IIB. The main tumor mass lies in segments 6 and 9 of the resected right lower lobe.

It consists of one grossly identifiable fragment\nof fleshy hemorrhagic tissue consistent with lung. A long black\nsuture which does not designate anything in particular is attached to\nthe specimen. The specimen weighs 66 grams and measures 10 x 6.5 x 4\ncm.A palpable massis identified in the parenchyma. The overlying\npleura is inked with black ink. Serially sectioning the lung reveals\na 2.5 cm tumor massthat is white tan and firm around the edges and\nslightly necrotic and hemorrhagic in the center. Tumor and normal\nlung are collected for the tumor bank and for lab for\nfurther studies. A tied off vessel is grossly identified. This\nvessel is sampled and assumed to be a vascular margin. A long\nparenchymal staple margin is grossly identified in the specimen in the\nshape of a Y. This margin measures 9 cm at its longest aspect and\nthere is also an arm of the staple margin that measures 4.2 cm. The\ntumormass appears to grossly abut the pleura. However, the tumor\nmassis located approximately 1.6 cm from the closest staple margin.\nThis staple margin is shaved and submitted in its entirety. The shave\nsuture margin is submitted in cassettes B-D.Sections are taken of\nthe tumor mass.Sectioning through the remainder of the lung\nparenchyma does not reveal any other mass lesions. Sections of normal\nlung are submitted. Additionally received with the specimen is a small\nfragment of rib. This rib measures 2.1 x 1.4 x 0.3 cm.

Suspected occupational exposure \nto asbestos. \nREPORT ON FINDINGS \nMacroscopy \n1.) Inflated, fixed right lung measuring 12 x 11 em at the base and np to 25 em in length, central bronchus \nresection plane located 1.2 em proximal to the bifurcation of the upper lobe bronchus. Upper pleural fissure \nextensively obliterated in dorsal third, over segment 6 and adjacent sections of S2 an 8.5 x 6 em area of parietal \npleura is extensively adhesive. At the hilus are six partly lesioned mobile grayish-black nodes between 1.1 and \n2 em in size, lower lobe bronchus and proximal sections oflower lobe segmental bronchi largely obstructed by \na central moderately solid, pale brownish, predominantly endobronchial tumor, max. 4.8 em in size, in the lower \nlobe. Involvement of several grayish-black pigmented nodes up to 1.4 em in size by the tumor. Central blood \nvessels partly narrowed by the tumor. Tumor spread across the pleural fissure questionably into the upper lobe. \nSleeve-like spread along the lower lobe bronchus, with apparent involvement of a 2.2 em grayish-black node \nextending right up to the hilar resection surface. Intermediate and peripheral lower lobe bronchial branches are \nmarkedly dilated and filled with thick mucus. Parenchyma in segment 6 below the pleural adhesion is an \nindurated and pale brownish-yellow area of about 3.5 em with unclear demarcation, medial parenchyma in \nsegment 3 and apical parenchyma in segment I rarefied with lacunae or lacuna systems of up to 0.5 em. Pleura \nover segment I shows whitish discoloration in several, partly striated areas of up to 5 em, underlying \nparenchyma here shows an indurated and grayish-white seam about 0.3 em thick. \n2.) Hilar LN (station 10) right: 2.6 em lesioned node or node part, section surfaces predominantly pale brown to \nwhitish suggestive of a tumor. \n3.) Pulmonary ligament LN (station 9) right: two lesioned grayish-black nodes with some surrounding tissue, \n0.3 and 1.2 em in size. \n4.) Paraesophageal LN (station 8) right: five lesioned grayish-black nodes or node parts between 0.3 and 1.2 \nem. \n5.) Snbcarinal LN (station 7): 2 em node part with pale brown to whitish section surfaces suggestive of a tumor. \n6.) Low paratracheal LN (station 4) right: 3.5 em lesioned node with predominantly pale brown to whitish \nsection surfaces suggestive of a tumor. \n7.) Retrotracheal right: 1 em lesioned grayish-black node with some snrronnding tissne. \n8.) High paratracheal LN (station 2) right: five lesioned grayish-brown nodes or node parts between 0.1 and I \nem. \n9.) Hilar LN (station (St.! 0) left: 2.5 em lesioned node or node part, section surfaces pale brown to whitish \nsuggestive of a tumor. \n10.) Low paratracheal LN (station 4) left: 1.5 em five lesioned grayish-brown node with some surrounding \ntissue. \nII.) High paratracheal LN (station 2) left: 1.1 em lesioned grayish-brown node with some sun\u00b7ounding tissue, \nsection surfaces pale brown to whitish . \n Examined: \n1.) Tumor with rest of parenchyma+ proximal branch ofBJO, 2 sections of tumor with lower lobe bronchus+ \ninvolved nodes, 2 sections with pleural fissure to upper lobe (upper lobe portion partly color-marked), 2 \nsections main bronchus at birfurcation of lower lobe bronchus with node close to hilus (hilar resection surface \ncolor-marked), SIO intermediate, S6 at junction of S2, Sl apical, S3 medial, S2 dorsal, central bronchus \nresection plane+ resection margins of vessels, hilar nodes, \n5.), 6.)

All material (in 10. and II. halved in each case), \n23 blocks, partly Elastica-van Gieson, PAS, diastase-PAS, iron staining. \nMicroscopy \nDescription of histological and cytological findings omitted for capacity reasons. \nEVALUATION \nPrimary diagnosis/diagnoses: \nCentral bronchopulmonary, histologically poorly to moderately differentiated, partly keratinizing squamous cell \ncarcinoma of the lower lobe of the right lung with marked lymphogenic metastasization. 1NM classification \naccording to this picture pT2 pN3 VI RO, stage lllB. C 34.3; M 8070/3. G3. \nSecondary diagnosis/diagnoses: \nLargely organized pneumonic infiltrate with fibrous parenchymal remodeling in S6 and old thromboses of \nadjacent small pulmonary arteries. Flat subpleural parenchymal scar in apical Sl with slight perifocal \nemphysema. Circumscribed high-grade emphysematous stromal remodeling with formation of small cysts in \nsegments I and 3. Minimal mixed dust deposits in lung parenchyma and accumulation of alveolar siderophages \nwith possible respiratory bronchiolitis. Pleural fibrosis especially over the fibrous remodeling area in S6 with \nadhesion. Tumor-free lymph nodes with slight to moderate pigment deposits and in some cases reactive \nfollicular hyperplasia. \nRemark/addendum: \nOn the one hand, the carcinoma is spreading to central segmental bronchi of the lower lobe by completely \ninfiltrating and obliterating these, while growing into the lower lobe bronchus. On the other hand, the tumor \nextends to the pleura fissure. The angioinvasion does not affect small arteries and veins in the tumor area. Most \nof the 30 lymph nodes found are infiltrated with metastases, and they are not only detected in the tumor area \nand the hilus region, while the lymph node metastasis the near the main bronchus extends to within 0.5 mm of \nthe mediastinal resection surface, but they are also found in the lymph node areas registered under 2.), 5.), 6.) \nand 8.)-II.).

Submitted fresh for tissue procurement labeled \"left \n             upper lobe\" is a lobe of lung tissue which has been \n    amputated at the level of its principle bronchus and blood vessels. \n    The bronchial profiles that are present consists of three bronchi, \n    each approximately 8 to 9 mm across. They are grossly unremarkable. \n    Some vascular stumps are present at the point of amputation as well. \n    There is some anthracotic tissue present which  may represent some \n    hilar lymph nodes.  The visceral pleural surface of the lobe is \n    intact although there is a small area of adhesion and thickening \n    overlying an obviously large intraparenchymal tumor mass.  The \n    remainder of the parenchyma is anthracotic without focal lesion. \n    The lung was serially sectioned and this reveals a very large tumor \n    mass present in the center of the lobe which has a extensively \n    necrotic center. The tumor mass measures maximally 6 cm. across. \n    There is a rim of granular brown black tumor tissue present which \n    appears to extend to the visceral pleural surface. The center of the \n    tumor is necrotic with a creamy yellowish red appearance.  Fresh \n    tissue from normal lung is submitted for procurement as per \n    request of  Sections through the remainder of the lung \n    show no othe esions.

Overlying the apex and the lateral \naspect of the apex of the lobe is an area of pleural tethering with an underlying tumour \nmass. The remainder of the pleural surface shows no specific abnonnality apart from \nextensive carbon pigmentation. The lobar bronchus has been transected t1ush with the \nhilar soft tissue and has two lumens at this point. Small peribronchial anthracotic \nnodes are noted, none of which appears macroscopically to be involved by a tumour. \nSectioning reveals an apical tumour mass which appears to be bilobed. The combined \nmaximum size of this lesion is 32 mm. The more superior lobule is approximately 20 \nmm in diameter and shows foci of central necrosis. The more lateral and inferior \nlesion is approximately 12 mm in diameter and has a solid cream to tan cut surface. \nIn some areas the lobules appear to be separated by 2 to 3 mm of unremarkable lung \nparenchyma. Both lobules abut the overlying pleura. No other lesions are identified \non serial slicing through the parenchyma. However there is severe emphysema. [1 A, \nbronchial resection margin; 1 B, peribronchial lymph nodes; 1 C-I D longitudinal \nsections through tumour including overlying pleura and both lobules; IE, sections of \ninferolateral solid nodule with overlying pleura; 1 F, uninvolved lung parenchyma.] \n2: The second specimen is labelled 'left hilar lymph node' and consists of three \nts of focally anthracotic and fatty tissue. [BIT,2A.] \nMICROSCOPY \n1: Sections show two adenocarcinomas. The first has a predominantly acinar architecture with a small \namount of surrounding bronchioloalveolar type growth. Ext~nsive blo.od vessel invasion is noted and \nthere is possible lymphatic penneatioll : The other lesion is a papillary adenocarcinoma. The lesions \nare separated by approximately 5 inm by unremarkable lung. A third focus of adenocarcinoma with a \nbronchioloalveolar pattern is present within the random section oflung. This measures 5 mm in \ndiameter. Overlying both tumours, there is scarring of the pleura and features suspicious for invasion. \nSpecial stains will be performed. No perineural permeation is identified. The lesion is well clear of the \nbronchial resection margin. No lymph node metastases are seen. The uninvolved lung shows evidence \nof emphysema. \n2: Sections of the lymph nodes show reactive changes only. There is no evidence of malignancy. \nSUMMARY \n1-2: Left upper lobe and left hilar lymph nodes: \nA: Three foci of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma; 20 mm (acinar), 12 mm (papillary) and 5 \nmm (bronchioloalveolar) in maximal dimension. \nB: Extensive blood vessel invasion; probable lymphatic permeation but no perineural permeation \npresent. \nC: Possible pleural invasion identified; special stains being performed; clear of bronchial margin. \nD: No lymph node metastases. \nE: TINO (awaiting pleural stains) \nF: Non-neop lastic lung: Mild emphysema.  SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT \n1: Tumour invades into the visceral pleura overlying the tumour 'with the acinar architecture . It is not \ndefinitely on the pleural surface. There is no invasion of the visceral pleura by the papillary carcinoma. \nBoth tumours stain positively for CK 7 and TTF 1. CK 20 is negative.

Situated within \nthe upper part of the lobe there is a large mass present medially. The pleural \nsurface overlying this mass appears intact. On sectioning through the lobe this \nmass measures approximately 72 mm in maximum dimension. It has a \nlobulated cream appearance on cut surface and comes to within 1 mm of the \npleural surface. Tumour is present surrounding the segmental bronchus but \ndoes not appear to have eroded through ~he bronchial wall. The endobronchial \nresection margin is clear of tumour. On section ing through the remainder of \nthe lung parenchyma there is anthracosis but no evidence of emphysema and \nno further lesions are identified. There is a small focus of cyst or bullous \nformation present at the apex. [RS tak<;:n through hilar lymph nodes, A and B; \nbronchovascular resection margin, C; tumour with overlying pleura, D-F; \ntumour surrounding bronchus, G and H; tumour and adjacent lung, I; tumour \nand apical blebs, J; macroscopically normal lung, K and L]. \nMicroscopy: \nSections show a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. The lesion is \nsubpleural and in areas there are features suspicious for pleural invasion. No \ntumour is present on the pleural surface. Special stains to assess pleural \ninvasion are being performed. There is no blood vessel invasion and no \nlymphatic permeation is seen. The lesion is well clear of the bronchial \nresection margin. No lymph node metastases are seen. The adjacent lung \nshows evidence of emphysema. \n2: PULMONARY VEIN NODE \nMacroscopy: \nSpecimen consists of two fragments of dark tan tissue measuring in aggregate \n18 x 6 x 4 mm. [BIT,2A]. \nMicroscopy: \nSections of the lymph nodes show reactive changes only. There is no evidence \nof malignancy. \n3: INTERLOBAR NODE \nMacroscopy: \nSpecimen consists of a single piece of dark tan tissue measuring 15 x lOx 6 \nmm. [Bisected and BIT, 3A]. \nMicroscopy: \nSections of the lymph nodes show reactive changes only. There is no evidence \nof malignancy. \n4: NUMBER 5 NODE \nMacroscopy: \nSpecimen consists of a single piece of fi bro fatty tissue measuring 14 x 6 x 4 \nmm. [BIT,4A]. \nMicroscopy:  Sections of the lymph nodes show reactive changes only. There is no evidence \nof malignancy. \n5: NUMBER 10 NODE \nMacroscopy: \nSpecimen consists of a single piece of dark tan tissue measuring 18 x lOx 4 \nmm. [BIT,5AJ _ \nMicroscopy: \nSections of the lymph nodes show reactive changes only. There is no evidence \nof malignancy. \nSummary: \nLung and lymph nodes: \nI: Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma; 72 mm in maximal dimension. \n2: No vascular invasion present. \n3: Possible pleural invasion identified; special stains are being performed. \n4: Clear of bronchial margin. \n5: T2NOMX \nT-28000 M-81403 PI-03000 \nADDENDUM REPORT \nThe carcinoma appears to extend just through the elastic laminae of the pleura. \nThere is no extension onto the pleural surface, though.

        "llm_output": " 1. \"Site\": Lung, specifically the left upper lobe. Justified as the report clearly states the specimen is a left upper lobectomy.\n2. \"Laterality\": Left. This is clear from the report's description of a left upper lobectomy.\n3. \"Histology\": Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. The report specifically mentions this under microscopy.\n4. \"Stage\": T2N0Mx. The tumor is 72mm in maximal dimension, invading the muscularis propria but there are no affected lymph nodes or distant metastases based on the report.\n5. \"Grade\": Not provided. The report mentions the histology is poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma but does not provide a specific grade.\n6. \"Behavior\": Malignant. This is implied as the report describes a cancerous tumor with invasion of the surrounding tissues."
