There are two tumor foci, one of peripheral\nzone and one of transition zone origin. The dominant tumor focus is located in the right anterolateral, right lateral, right\nposterolateral, right posterior, mid posterior, left posterior, left posterolateral, left lateral and left anterolateral peripheral zone with\nextension into the transition zone. This tumor focus measures 4.0 x 3.0 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and it is\npresent in three cross sections and extensively in the apex and base regions. This tumor focus exhibits multifocal extraprostatic\nextension and multifocal extension to the margin of resection. This tumor focus extensively invades both seminal vesicles\nincluding intra and extraprostatic portions and perivesicular soft tissue. The second tumor focus is located in the right and left\ntransition zone. This tumor focus measures 2.0 x 1.0 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in three cross\nsections, extensively in the apex and focally in the base region. This tumor focus is of lower histologic grade (Gleason score\n6/3+3) and it is confined to the prostate.\nPlease refer to the previous report for the diagnosis of the pelvic lymph nodes.\nGROSS :DESCRIPTION\n(C) PROSTATE, SEMINAL VESICLES - A prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles and attached segments of right and\nleft vasa deferentia.\nThe prostate gland (5.3 x 3.5 x 3.6 cm, 56 gm, postfixation) has the usual shape. A nodule is palpated in the right mid and\nright base regions.

However, it can be inferred to be the breast based on the context.\n* Laterality: The laterality (left or right side) of the breast is also not provided in the report.\n* Histology: The histology of the tumor is invasive ductal carcinoma, which means the cancer has developed from the milk ducts and has invaded the surrounding tissue.\n* Stage: The stage of the cancer is T2N1M0, which indicates that the tumor is greater than 2 cm in size, has spread to at least one axillary lymph node, but has not yet metastasized to other parts of the body.\n* Grade: The grade of the cancer is not provided in the report. However, it can be inferred that it is a high-grade tumor based on the fact that it has invaded the surrounding tissue.\n* Behavior: The behavior of the cancer is malignant, meaning it is capable of spreading to other parts of the body and causing harm.\n\nThe reason for the discrepancy between pathology and radiology reports could be due to differences in interpretation or measurement of the tumor size, location, and involvement of lymph nodes. Without access to both reports, it is difficult to provide a definitive justification for the discrepancy."

The tumor is located in the right posterolateral, right\nposterior, mid posterior, and left posterior peripheral zone. The tumor focus measures 2.5 x 0.9 cm in the largest cross-sectional\ndimension, and it is present in the three cross sections of the prostate, extensively in the apex and focally in the base region. The\ntumor is confined to the prostate. The margins of resection are free of tumor.\nGROSS DESCRIPTION\n(D) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A specimen consisting of a prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles and\nattached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.\nThe prostate gland (5.2 x 2.5 x 3.8 cm, 36 grams, post-fixation) has the usual shape. The soft tissue present along the\nposterolateral aspect of the prostate is abundant and more extensive along the right side. An area of firmness is noted on the\nmidline posterior surface of the prostate. Serial cross sections after fixation demonstrate an area of tumor in the mid posterior\nregion of the two cross sections of the prostate.\nThe seminal vesicles and segments of vasa deferentia are grossly free of tumor.\nSECTION CODE: D1-D3, right seminal vesicle and segment of right vas deferens from the base towards the tip; D4, D5,\nleft seminal vesicle and segment of left vas deferens from the base towards the tip; D6, prostatic base right border; D7-D9,\nprostatic base right posterior border; D10-D12, prostatic base central portion; D13, D14, prostatic base left border; D15, D16,\nprostatic base left posterior border; D17, D18, apex anterior; D19, D20, apex left; D21, D22, apex posterior; D23, D24, apex right;\nD25-D36, sections of the three cross sections of the prostate according to specimen radiograph.\nThe anterior aspect of the prostate is inked in green, left surface in red, right surface in yellow and posterior surface in\nblack. Blue ink (D7, 8, 10-12, 19-24, 27, 28, 32 and 36) and orange ink (D31) denote surfaces that do not represent a true margin\nof resection.

Specimen (s) Received\nA:Prostate, radical resection (fresh)\nClinical History\nThe patient is a year-old man with prostate cancer, Gleason grade 3+3.\nGross Description\nThe specimen is received fresh in one part, labeled with the patient's name and medical record number\nand \"prostate and seminal vesicles, left ampulla single short stitch; right seminal vesicle single long.\" It\nconsists of three separate pieces of tissue. One is the prostate gland, the second is the left ampulla (as\ndesignated by the surgeon with a single short stitch), and the third piece Is the right seminal vesicle (as\ndesignated by the surgeon with a single long stitch). The prostate will be described first. The prostate\ngland measures 4 cm from apex to base, 6 cm from medial to lateral, and 4 cm from anterior to\nposterior. The exterior of the gland Is roughened and pink-tan. Focal cautery markings are seen along\nthe base/bladder margin. Sutures are present along the anterior midline. Tiny metal staples are also\nfound embedded. There is a left seminal vesicle/vas deferens bundle attached, measuring 1.7 x 2 x 0.6\ncm. The right seminal vesicle/vas deferens bundle is not attached; as noted by the surgeon, they were\ndetached intraoperatively and will be described below. The left seminal vesicle/vas deferens bundle Is\nsoft, pink-tan, and whorled and has no discrete lesions. The right anterior surface of the gland Is inked\nIn green, the left anterior surface Is inked in blue, and the posterior surface is inked in black. The\nspecimen Is bisected roughly perpendicular to the urethral channel, and two fresh 6-mm punch biopsies\nare taken for research purposes. The two halves of the specimen are then glued, and the prostate is\nfixed prior to further sectioning. Following fixation, the apical and bladder margins are removed, and\nthe remainder of the gland is serially sectioned, from apex to base, into three serial slices. The serial\nslices reveal central and transitional zones composed of firm, slightly lobulated, pink-tan, and partially\ncystic tissue surrounded by firmer, white-tan, striated tissue. The periphery is composed of a thinner\nrim of softer, semi-porous, light tan tissue along the posterior surface. One suspicious lesion Is seen in\nthe right half of serial slices 1 and 2 and 3. This suspicious lesion is firm yellow-tan, and irregular and\nmeasures 0.7 cm in greatest dimension. Following further dissection and submission of tissue for\npathologic evaluation, serial slice 3 is taken for tissue banking/research purposes.\nThe second piece of tissue, which the surgeon designates as left ampulla with a single short stitch, is\nfirm, irregular, and pink-tan, weighs 1 gm, and measures 2 x 1 x 0.5 cm. The external surface of the\nleft ampulla is inked blue.

The tumor is located in the right lateral, right\nposterolateral, right posterior, mid posterior, left posterior, left posterolateral and left lateral peripheral zone. The tumor focus\nmeasures 3.0 x 1.4 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension, and it is present in the two cross sections of the prostate and\nextensively in the apex and base regions. The tumor exhibits extensive, multifocal extraprostatic extension. Areas of\nextraprostatic extension include the right and left posterolateral surface of the prostate, right and left posterior surface of the\nprostate, right and posterior apex, base region anterior to the left seminal vesicle and left superior neurovascular bundle. On the\nleft superior neurovascular bundle, at the site of extraprostatic extension, tumor is present at the inked margin of resection. The\nextent of marginal involvement in this region is less than 1.0 mm. In other regions, carcinoma is present at less than 0.1 mm from\nthe inked margin of resection (posterior apex and bladder neck region). The tumor invades both seminal vesicles including\nextraprostatic portion of the right and left seminal vesicles, and intraprostatic portion of the left seminal vesicle. Involvement of\nperivesicular soft tissue is also present.\nPlease refer to the previous report for the diagnosis of the pelvic lymph nodes.\nGROSS. DESCRIPTION\n(A) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A specimen consisting of a prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles and\nattached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.\nThe prostate gland (4.1 x 3.4 x 3.0 cm, 24 grams ,post-fixation) has the usual shape .The soft tissue present along the left\nposterolateral aspect of the prostate is scant ,but slightly more abundant than along the right side. A nodule is palpated in the left\napex and right side of the prostate .Serial cross sections after fixation demonstrate areas suspicious for tumor in the right side of\nthe two cross sections of the prostate.

The\ndominant tumor focus is located in the left anterolateral, left lateral and left posterolateral peripheral zone with extension into the\nleft transition zone. This tumor focus measures 2.0 x 0.8 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in the two\ncross-sections of the prostate and extensively in the apex and base. In the left superior neurovascular bundle region this tumor\nfocus extends into extraprostatic tissue (6.0 mm). The margins of resection are free of tumor. The second tumor focus is located\nin the right transition zone. This tumor focus measures 1.4 x 1.2 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and is present in two\ncross-sections and extensively in the apex and base. This tumor focus is of lower histologic grade (Gleason score 7/3+4) and\nconfined to the prostate. The margins of resection are free of tumor.\nPlease refer to the previous report for the diagnosis of the pelvic lymph nodes.\nGROSS..

The\ndominant tumor focus and the one of the highest histologic grade is located in the right and left transition zone. This tumor focus\nmeasures 3.0 x 1.5 cm in the largest cross -sectional dimension, and it is present in four cross sections and extensively in the\napical region .This tumor focus exhibits predominately Gleason grades 4 and 3. A minor (tertiary )component of Gleason grade 5\nis also present. This tumor exhibits focal extraprostatic extension (less than 1 .0 mm) in the right anterior surface of the prostate\nand extends to the margin of resection in the anterior apical region. The extent of marginal involvement is 6.0 mm .The two\nperipheral zone foci are located in the left posterolateral and right lateral peripheral zone. The tumor located in the left\nposterolateral peripheral zone measures 0.8 x 0 .4 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension, and it is present in the first cross\nsection of the prostate .The third tumor focus is located in the right lateral peripheral zone. This tumor measures 0.5 x 0.2 cm in\nthe largest cross-sectional dimension ,and it is present in one cross section. The non-dominant tumor foci are of lower histologic\ngrade (Gleason score 6/3 + 3) and are confined to the prostate with negative margins.\nGROSS DESCRIPTION\n(A) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A specimen consisting of a prostate ,attached right and left seminal vesicles and\nattached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.\nThe prostate gland (2.5 x 2. 2 x 4.0 cm ,31 grams ,post fixation )has the usual shape .The soft tissue present along the\nright and left posterolateral aspects of the prostate appears symmetrical .A palpable and visible nodule is observed in the left mid\nregion of the prostate .Serial cross sections after fixation demonstrate firm areas consistent with tumor in the right transition zone\nand right peripheral zone of the first three of the four cross sections of the prostate.\nThe seminal vesicles and segments of vasa deferentia are grossly free of tumor.\nSECTION CODE: Al, A2, base of right seminal vesicle and right vas deferens ;A3, A4, base of left seminal vesicle and\nleft vas deferens ;A5, prostatic base ,right border ;A6, A7 , prostatic base ,right posterior border ;A8, A9, prostatic base ,central\nportion; Al0, prostatic base ,left border ;Al 1, A12, prostatic base ,left posterior border ;A13, A14 , apex anterior ;A15, apex left; Page: 3\nSpecimen Date/Time:\nA16-A18, apex posterior ;A19, apex right ;A20-A35, sections of the four cross sections of the prostate according to specimen\nradiograph.\nThe anterior aspect of the prostate is inked in green ,left surface in red, right surface in yellow and posterior surface in\nblack.\nSNOMED CODES\nT-92000, M-Y1973\nEntire report and diagnosis completed by:\n------END OF REPORT------\nDiagnosis oiscre .-.\nPrimary Tumor SiteDi:creparcy\nDi,p-p.\nPrior Malignancy fl,;tory \"\nDualJStia- ch rono ;rsPn:naryN\n.irclc",

The largest tumor focus although not the one of the highest histologic grade (Gleason score 5/3+2) located in the right and\nleft transition zone. This tumor focus measures 2.7 x 1.3 cm in the largest cross sectional dimension and it is present in four cross\nsections and focally in the apical region. This tumor focus is confined to the prostate and the margins of resection are free of\ntumor. The second tumor focus is located in the left lateral, left posterolateral, left posterior, mid posterior and right posterior\nperipheral zone. This tumor focus measures 2.2 x 1.5 cm in the largest cross sectional dimension and it is present in three cross\nsections, extensively in the apex and focally in the base region. This tumor focus is a high grade carcinoma (Gleason score 4+5)\nand is associated with an increased lymphocytic infiltrate. The tumor focus exhibits extraprostatic extension in the left apex and left\nposterolateral aspect of the prostate. Extraprostatic extension is present in two separate sections and the added length of\nextraprostatic tumor is 9.0 mm. At the site of extraprostatic extension the margins of resection are free of tumor. This tumor focus\nfocally extends to less than 0.1 mm from the margin of resection in the apex. This tumor focus invades the intraprostatic portion of\nthe left seminal vesicle.\nDue to the presence of distortion in areas of the tumor close to the margins of resection in the apex and the presence of a marked\nlymphocytic infiltrate, immunoperoxidase studies for keratin, lymphocyte marker and neuroendocrine differentiation markers were\nperformed. Cytokeratin highlights tumor which is seen focally approaching but not at the margins of r section. The lymphocytic\ninfiltrate is a mixture of both CD20 positive B lymphocytes and CD5 positive T lymphocytes with a pr dominance of the latter. The\ntumor is negative for synaptophysin but a few scattered neoplastic cells are positive for chromograni supporting the presence of\nfocal minimal neuroendocrine differentiation. Page: 4\n(D) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A specimen consisting of a prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles and\nattached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.\nThe prostate gland (4.5 x 2.5 x 4.5 cm, 40 grams, post-fixation) has the usual shape.

Both tumor foci are located in the peripheral zone. The\ndominant tumor focus is located in the left lateral, left posterolateral, left posterior, mid-posterior, right posterior, right posterolateral\nand right lateral peripheral zone. This tumor focus measures 3.8 x 1.8 cm in largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in\nthe two cross-sections of the prostate and extensively in the apex and base. The tumor exhibits extraprostatic extension on the left\nposterolateral surface of the prostate and right and left superior neurovascular bundle regions. The tumor extends to the right\nbladder neck margin of resection. The area of the positive margin is cauterized and the added length of the cauterized margin on\nthe right base is 4.0 mm. The second tumor focus is located in the right anterolateral and right lateral peripheral zone. This tumor\nfocus measures less than 0.1 x less than 0.1 cm in largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in the first cross-section and\nfocally in the apex. The non-dominant tumor focus is of lower histologic grade and confined to the prostate with negative margins.\nGROSS .DESCRIPTION\n(E) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A specimen consisting of a prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles and\nattached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.\nThe prostate gland (5.0 x 2.5 x 4.0 cm, 28.0 grams, post-fixation) has the usual shape.

The dominant tumor focus\nis considered of peripheral zone origin. This tumor focus involves predominantly the right side the prostate. The tumor involves\nthe right posterolateral ,right lateral ,right anterolateral ,right anterior ,mid anterior ,left anterior, left anterolateral, left lateral and left\nposterolateral peripheral zone with extension into the right and left transition zone .This tumor focus measures 3.9 x 2 .4 cm in the\nlargest cross -sectional dimension and it involves the three cross sections of the prostate ,and extensively the apex and base. The\ntumor extends into extraprostatic tissue at multiple sites including the left apex ,right anterolateral surface, right base. The added\nlength of extraprostatic extension is 3.0 mm. The tumor invades at the base of the prostate thick smooth muscle bundles\nconsistent with microscopic bladder neck invasion. It should be noted that microscopic bladder neck invasion is considered pT3a.\nThe margins of resection are free of tumor.\nThe second tumor focus is located in the left transition zone .This tumor focus measures 1.5 x 0.2 cm in greatest cross-sectional\ndimension ,and involves one cross section of the prostate ,and focally the base. The third tumor focus is located in the left\ntransition zone ,exclusively in the apex. This tumor focus measures 0.4 x 0 .2 cm in largest cross sectional dimension ,and it is\npresent in one apical section. The non -dominant tumor foci are of lower histologic grade and are confined to the prostate with\nnegative margins.\nImmunohistochemical stains with ERG (E27, E43 ,E49) are negative. These results are non-contributory towards supporting\nmultiple tumor foci of different zonal origin.\nPT/JH/rgw\nDD: 1/24/13\n1/24/2013 11:16 AM\nGROSS DESCRIPTION\n(E) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A specimen consisting of a prostate ,attached right and left seminal vesicles and\nattached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.\nThe prostate gland (4.5 x 3.0 x 4.2 cm , 48.0 grams ,post-fixation) has the usual shape .The soft tissue present along the Page: 4 KKA046-PATH\nSpecimen Date Time :12/27/2012\nright posterolateral aspect of the prostate appears more abundant than along the left side .Serial cross sections after fixation\ndemonstrate an area consistent with tumor within the right side of the three cross sections of the prostate.

The tumor is located in the right anterolateral, right lateral,\nright posterolateral, right posterior, mid posterior, left posterior, left posterolateral and left lateral peripheral zone. The tumor focus\nmeasures 3.0 x 2. cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in three cross sections and extensively in the apex\nand base regions. The tumor invades focally the right bladder neck. The tumor invades focally the intraprostatic portion of the right\nseminal vesicle. The margins of resection are free of tumor.\nPlease refer to the previous report for the diagnosis of the pelvic lymph nodes.\nGROSS DESCRIPTION\n(C) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A prostate ,attached right and left seminal vesicles and attached segments of right\nand left vasa deferentia.\nThe prostate gland (3.5 x 2.0 x 4.8 cm, 42 gm, postfixation) has the usual shape. The soft tissue present along the left\nposterolateral aspects of the prostate appears more abundant than along the right side. A nodule is palpated on the right base\nregion. Blue ink is applied to surfaces of the prostate (anterior apex and under flap on left posterior surface) which do not represent\nthe true margin of resection.\nSECTION CODE: C1-C3, right seminal vesicle and segment of right vas deferens from the base towards the tip; C4-C6,\nleft seminal vesicle and segment of left vas deferens from the base towards the tip; C7, C8, prostatic base right border; C9-C11, Page: 4\nAccession:\nSpecimen Date Time:\nprostatic base right posterior border ;C12-C19, prostatic base central portion ;C20-C22, prostatic base left border ;C23-C25,\nprostatic base left posterior border ;C27-C29, apex anterior ;C30, C31, apex left ;C32, C33 , apex posterior ;C34, C35 , apex right;\nC36, C37, detached portions from margin of resection according to specimen radiograph ;C38-C49, sections of the three cross\nsections of the prostate according to specimen radiograph.\nThe anterior aspect of the prostate is inked ink green ,left surface in red, right surface in yellow and posterior surface in\nblack .Blue ink (23-29, 42, 43 and 46) and orange ink (C38, 41, 44-47 and 49) denote surfaces that do not represent the true\nmargin of resection.\n.SNOMED CODES\nEntire report and diagnosis completed by:\n------END OF REPORT------",

Since the \nstatus of the resection margin in unclear in the region of the right apex, further investigations will \nbe conducted. \nAn additional immunohistological investigation will be carried out to establish whether there is \nany invasion of the vessels. The results will be presented in a follow-up report. \nNo evidence of the previously described mantle cell lymphoma could be detected in these \nfindings from the investigation of the lymph nodes. \nFollow-up report \nMicroscopy \n(HE, I tissue block, immunohistochemistry: AEII AE3 and 2 fmiher tissue blocks in each case \nimmunohistochemislly: D240 and CD31. \nIn the meantime, fmiher step sections and a supplementary immunohistochemical investigation \nwere carried out with suspected tumor involvement of the surgical resection margin in the region \nof the right apex. Tumor cells here extend very nearly to the blue-labeled preparation margin. In \nview of the very marked thermal atiifacts in this region, however, it is difficult to make any \nassessment here. Individual cytokeratin-positive cells have questionable contact with the blue\u00ad\nlabeled resection margin, but no unequivocal evidence of tumor contact can be shown with \nabsolute certainty even after additional investigations, so the R status must most likely be \nassumed to be RO. \nThe additional immunohistochemical investigation of two representative tumor blocks confirms \nthe presence of a tumorous invasion of the lymph vessels. No signs of blood vessel invasion \nwere found.  The final tumor classification is thus as follows: \npTIb, maximum tumor diameter 17 mm, tumor involves approx. 30% of the total prostate, \nGleason 4+5=9 (Gleason 5: 20%), L1, YO, pN1 (2110), RO. ",

The tumor is located in the right\nanterior, mid anterior, left anterior , left anterolateral , left lateral, left posterolateral, left posterior, mid\nposterior, right posterior, right posterolateral and right lateral peripheral zone. It is estimated that the tumor\noccupies approximately 70% of the prostatic volume. The tumor focus measures 4.5 x 3.0 cm in the largest\ncross-sectional dimension and it is present in three cross sections and extensively in the apex and base\nregions. The tumor exhibits extraprostatic extension in the left lateral and left posterolateral aspect of the\nprostate, left superior neurovascular bundle region and posterior surface of the prostate at the base level.\nAt the sites of extraprostatic extension, the margin of resection is free of tumor. The tumor extends in the\nright posterolateral aspect of the prostate to less than 0.1 mm from the inked surface. Focal marginal\ninvolvement cannot be excluded.\nThe tumor extensively involves the left seminal vesicle including intra and extraprostatic portions.\nPlease refer to the previous report for the diagnosis of the pelvic lymph nodes.\nGROSS DESCRIP TION Page: 4\nSpecimen Date/Time:\n(D) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A specimen consisting of a prostate, attached right and left\nseminal vesicles and attached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.\nThe prostate gland (5.8 x 3.3 x 3.4 cm, 51 grams, post-fixation) has the usual shape. The soft tissue\npresent along the left posterolateral aspect of the prostate appears more abundant than along the right side.\nNodules are palpated on the left and right sides of the prostate .Serial cross sections after fixation\ndemonstrate areas consistent with tumor in the right posterolateral and left posterolateral peripheral zone of\nthe three cross sections of the prostate.\nThe seminal vesicles and segments of vasa deferentia are grossly free of tumor.\nSECTION CODE :D1-D3, right seminal vesicle and segment of right vas deferens from the base\ntowards the tip; D4-D6, left seminal vesicle and segment of left vas deferens from the base towards the tip;\nD7, D8 ,prostatic base ,right border ;D9-D12, prostatic base, right posterior border ;D13-D22 ,prostatic base,\ncentral portion; D23, D24, prostatic base, left border; D5-D28, prostatic base, left posterior border; D29-D31,\napex anterior; D32, D33, apex left; D34, D35, apex posterior; D36, D37, apex right; D38-D49, sections of\nthe three cross sections of the prostate according to specimen radiograph.\nThe anterior aspect of the prostate is inked in green ,left surface in red, right surface in yellow and\nposterior surface in black.\nSNOMED CODE S\nT-92000, M-Y1973\nEntire report and diagnosis completed by:\n------END OF REPORT------\nCriteria\nDiagnosis Discrepancy\nPrimary Tumor Site Discrepancy\n111PAA Disuepancy\nPrior Malignancy History\nNoted Dual/Synchronous Primary\ncase is tunic):\nReviewer Init!Yes -",

Per the operative\nnote, there is no lymph node tissue, or fatty tissue In the obturator fossa or overlying external iliac\nveins, so a lymph node dissection Is not performed.\nGross Description\nThe specimen is received in two parts, each labeled with the patient's name and medical record number.\nPart A, received fresh and labeled \"prostate and seminal vesicles,\" consists of a 29 gm radical\nprostatectomy specimen measuring 3.1 cm from superior to inferior, 4.5 cm from medial to lateral, and\n2.4 cm from anterior to posterior, containing an unremarkable left seminal vesicle (3.0 x 1.1 x 0.5 cm),\nright seminal vesicle (3.0 x 1.7 x 0.9 cm), left vas deferens (2.5 x 0.6 cm), and right vas deferens (2.3\nx 0.6 cm). A portion of the tumor is taken for tissue banking purposes from the left and right posterior\nmid gland. The specimen Is then glued together and is fixed overnight. After fixation, the apex and\nbase urethral margins are removed, and the specimen is transversely sectioned from apex to base into\neight slices.There are suspicious tan-white nodules in the left posterior mid gland (slice 4) and the left\nand right posterior mid glands (slice 6). The nodules do not appear to Involve the seminal vesicles, and\ndo not involve any of the specimen margins. The surface of the prostate gland is somewhat roughened\nand contains numerous metal surgical clips. The left prostate Is Inked blue, the right green,, and the\ndeep, black. Representative sections are submitted as follows:\nApical margins\nCassette Al: Right apex, 12 - 6 o'clock, radially sectioned and entirely submitted.\nCassette A2: Left apex, 12 - 6 o'clock, radially sectioned and entirely submitted.\nRight anterior quadrant\nCassette A3: Serial slice 2.\nCassette A4: Serial slice 4.\nCassette AS: Serial slice 6.\nRight posterior quadrant\nCassette A6: Serial slice 2.\nCassette A7: Serial slice 4.\nCassette A8: Serial slice 6.\nCassette A9: Serial slice 8.\nLeft posterior quadrant\nCassette A10: Serial slice 2.\nCassette All: Serial slice 4.\nCassette A12: Serial slice 6.

This tumor focusmeasures 2.0 x 1 .0 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in the single cross section of the prostate and\nextensively in the apex and base. In the right superior neurovascular bundle region, this tumor focus extends focally into\nextraprostatic tissue. The added length of extraprostatic extension is 2.0 mm. The margins of resection are free of tumor. The\nsecond tumor focus is located in the left lateral and left posterolateral peripheral zone. This tumor focus measures 1.0 x 0.4 cm in\nthe largest cross -sectional dimension and it is present in the single cross section of the prostate and focally in the apex and base.\nThis tumor focus is of lower histologic grade and confined to the prostate with negative margins.\nGROSS DESCRIPTION\n(E) LEFT BASE - A fragment of tan-gray tissue measuring 1.5 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm .No orientation provided .Submitted in E.(F)PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES- A specimen consisting of a prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles andattached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.\nThe prostate gland (4.6 x 2.2 x 2.7 cm, 21 grams ,post fixation) has the usual shape. The soft tissue present along the\nposterolateral aspects of the prostate is scant and symmetrical .A firm nodule is present on the right base of the prostate.

This tumor focus measures 2.5 x 1.6 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in\nthe two cross sections of the prostate, extensively in the apex and focally in the base region. This tumor exhibits extensive\nmultifocal extraprostatic extension. Extraprostatic extension is present in the right anterolateral and right lateral surface of the\nprostate and in the right superior neurovascular bundle region. Extraprostatic extension is present in multiple sections and the\nadded length of extraprostatic extension is 5.0 mm. The margins of resection are free of tumor. The second tumor focus is\nlocated in the right and left transition zone. This tumor focus measures 1.6 x 0.5 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and it\nis present in the two cross sections of the prostate and focally in the apex and base regions.

The dominant tumor focus is located in multiple regions of the right side of the prostate and exhibits extensive multifocal extraprostatic extension. The second tumor focus is located in the right and left transition zone and is of lower histologic grade but confined to the prostate. All margins of resection are free of tumor, and there is no evidence of lymphovascular invasion or metastasis to the seminal vesicles or vas deferens. The Gleason score for the dominant tumor focus is 7 (4+3), indicating a moderately differentiated cancer with a worse prognosis than lower-grade cancers. Overall, the report suggests that the patient has malignant prostatic adenocarcinoma with extraprostatic extension and a Gleason score of 7, affecting both sides of the prostate gland."

Both tumor foci are located in the peripheral zone. The\ndominant tumor focus is located in the right anterolateral, right lateral, right posterolateral and right posterior peripheral zone. This\ntumor focus measures 2.0 x 1.0 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in two cross sections and extensively\nin the apex and base region. In the right superior neurovascular bundle region, this tumor focus extends into extraprostatic tissue.\nThe extent of margin of extraprostatic extension is 4.0 mm. The margin of resection is free of tumor.\nThe second tumor focus is located in the left posterolateral peripheral zone, exclusively in the apical region. This tumor focus\nmeasures 1.0 x 0.2 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in a single apical section. This tumor is confined\nto the prostate. All margins of resection are free of tumor.\nGROSS DESCRIPTION\n(A)PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A specimen consisting of a prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles and\nattached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.The prostate gland (4.7 x 2.7 x 3.0 cm, 28 grams, post fixation) has the usual shape. The soft tissue present along the left\nposterolateral aspect of the prostate appears slightly more abundant than along the right side. An area of firmness is noted on the\nright side of the prostate. Serial cross sections after fixation demonstrate an area consistent with tumor in the right side of the two\ncross sections of the prostate.\nThe seminal vesicles and segments of vasa deferentia are grossly free of tumor.\nAlso included in the container are three fragments of tubular structures consistent with vas deferens measuring 2.6 x 0.4 x\n0.2 cm, 3.7 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm, 1.2 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm and a fragment of adipose tissue measuring 1.2 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm.\nSECTION CODE: Al -A4, detached fragments of tissue; A5-A7, right seminal vesicle and segment of right vas deferens\nfrom the base towards the tip; A8-A1 0, left seminal vesicle and segment of left vas deferens from the base towards the tip; Al 1, Page: 3\nSpecimen Date Time:\nprostatic base, right border; A12, A13, prostatic base, right posterior border; A14-A18, prostatic base, central portion; A19,\nprostatic base, left border; A20, A21, prostatic base, left posterior border; A22, A23, apex anterior; A24, A25, apex left; A26, A27,\napex posterior; A28, A29, apex right; A30-A37, sections of the two cross sections of the prostate according to specimenradiograph.\nThe anterior aspect of the prostate is inked in green, left surface in red, right surface in yellow and posterior surface inblack.Blue ink (A29) and orange ink (A34 and A35) denote surfaces that do not represent the true margin of resection.\nSNOMED CODES\nEntire report and diagnosis completed by:\n------END OF REPORT------",

Two tumor-free lipomatous lymph nodes. No malignancy. \nRemark \nExtensive carcinoma infiltrates are found in the peripheral zone of both sides in all sections of \nthe prostate. An infiltration of the perisprostatic fatty connective tissue is found along major \nnerves in the right lateral region close to the apex and on the right close to the base. No \nidentifiable invasion of the vessels. The left medial patt of the apex shows foci of contact \nbetween the carcinoma and the blue labeling (diameter about 2 cm).

The left is inked black and the right blue.The apical margin is shaved and then sectioned perpendicularly. The basemargin is similarly sectioned. The bases of the seminal vesicles aresampled. On sectioning, there is mild central nodular hyperplasia. Theperipheral lobes are tan and spongy with a 2.1 x 2.0 cm indurated paleyellow focus within the left lobe near the mid-point.

During the operative procedure there was a surgical violation of the \nprostatic capsule in two places that were marked by surgical sutures for gross examination. One of \nthese areas was at the site of the positive margin and comparing this information to the histological \nsection it is likely that inked drained through this surgically created cleft. In summary, it is likely that the \ntumor at the inked surface in this slide is not a true margin. ",

On palpation, multiple firm fatty possible lymph \nnodes are identified ranging from 0.1 up to 2.0 cm in \ngreatest dimension. They are entirely submitted in cassettes \nA 1-4, labeled designated as follows: A 1, \nfive whole possible Iympn nodes; A2, four whole possible \nlymph nodes; A:3 and 4, one whole possible bisected lymph \nnode in each cassette. \nB. The specimen is received in a single formalin-filled \ncontainer labeled with the patients name \n\"prostate,\" and contains a 34.9 gm, 4.8 x 3.5 x 3.0 cm \nprostate received with attached bilateral adnexa having \noverall dimensions of 6.5 x 3.5 x 0.5 cm. The capsule is' \ntan-gray and shaggy. The specimen is inked as follows: right \nside blue, left side black. The base and apical margins are \nconed and serially sectioned. The remainder of the gland is \nserially sectioned from apex to base to reveal a 1.5 x 1.0 x \n0.8 cm, well-circumscribed, yellow-tan nodule located in the \nright posterior quadrant. This nodule abuts the inked \ncapsule. Additionally, a 2.5 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm, ill-defined \narea of tan-orange discoloration is present within the right \nand left posterior quadrants. This area approaches to within \n0.5 cm of the base margin and to within 0.2 cm of the right \nprostate/seminal vesicle junction. The remainder of the cut \nsurface is pink-tan and focally cystic with diffuse \nperiurethral nodularity. No additional lesions or calculi \nare identified. Representative sections are submitted in \ncassettes B 1-18, labeled designated as \nfollows: 1, right prostate/seminal vesicle junction; 2, left \nprostate /seminal vesicle junction; 3 and 4, apical margin, \nperpendicular; 5 and 6, base margin, perpendicular; 7-9, \nright anterior, apex to base; 10-12, right posterior, apex \nto base; 13-15, left anterior, apex to base; 16-18, left \nposterior, apex to base.

The tumor measures 3.5 x 2.5 cm in the largest\ncross-sectional dimension and it is present in the two cross sections of the prostate and extensively in the apex and base. The\ntumor involves the right anterolateral, right lateral, right posterolateral, right posterior, mid posterior, left posterior and left lateral\nperipheral zone with extension into the right and left transition zone. The tumor exhibits extraprostatic extension in multiple areas\nand extends to the margin of resection on the anterior and right apical region. The added length of marginal involvement is 6.0\nmm. The tumor invades the right seminal vesicle.\nPlease refer to the previous report for the diagnosis of the pelvic lymph nodes.\nGROSS DESCRIPTION\n(C) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A specimen consisting of a prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles and\nattached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.\nThe prostate gland (4.9 x 4.0 x 4.5 cm, 30.0 grams, post-fixation) has the usual shape. The soft tissue present along the\nright posterolateral aspect of the prostate is abundant and more extensive than along the left side. Nodules are palpated on the\nright and left sides of the prostate. Serial cross-sections after fixation demonstrate areas consistent with tumor, involving the right\nand left sides of the two cross sections of the prostate.\nThe seminal vesicles and segments of vasa deferentia are grossly free of tumor.\nSECTION CODE: C1-C4, right seminal vesicle and segment of right vas deferens from the base towards the tip; C5-C8,\nleft seminal vesicle and segment of left vas deferens from the base towards the tip; C9, C 10, prostatic base, right border;\nC11-C13, prostatic base, right posterior border; C14-C22, prostatic base, central portion; C23, prostatic base, left border; C24,\nC25, prostatic base, left posterior border; C26, C27, apex anterior; C28, C29, apex left; C30-C33, apex posterior; C34, C35, apex\nright; C36, detached portions of margin of resection according to the specimen radiograph; C37-C44, sections of the two\ncross-sections of the prostate according to the specimen radiograph.\nThe anterior aspect of the prostate is inked in green, left surface in red, right surface in yellow and posterior surface in Page: 4\nSpecimen Date/Time:\nblack .Blue ink (C39 and C43 )and orange ink (C37 and C40) denote surfaces that do not represent the true margin of resection.\nSNOMED CODES\nn ire repo an iagnosis completed by:\n------END OF REPORT------\n%\n#4 P\"ut^\nanclDi^a^no:is Uis^: ep_\nPrimary i_urnorSite [`,screPa ncY^^1\ntIIP^ Discrepair.,Ti'LidcYH!storVIionnM ^ ^ Prig\nr D.a/SYnch venous P_nrnar\n';NUArI/DI54U^LIfIE^ ,^`\nCase is ^ciiclc?:Uate Reviewed'\naeviewcr Initials __-----^",
        "llm_output": " Site: Prostate and seminal vesicles\nLaterality: Right seminal vesicle involved\nHistology: Prostatic adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 9 (4 + 5)\nStage: Not provided in the report, but extensive extraprostatic extension, invasion into the right seminal vesicle, and involvement of the margin of resection are mentioned.\nGrade: Gleason score 9 (4 + 5)\nBehavior: Malignant\n\nJustification for the choice: The report specifically mentions the diagnosis of prostatic adenocarcinoma with a Gleason score of 9, indicating a high-grade tumor. There is also extensive extraprostatic extension and involvement of the right seminal vesicle, suggesting that the cancer has spread beyond the prostate gland. The involvement of the margin of resection indicates that some cancer cells are present at the edge of the surgical specimen, increasing the risk of recurrence. Therefore, based on the information provided in the report, I have categorized this as a high-grade and locally advanced prostate cancer with a poor prognosis."

Histology: Adenocarcinoma, which is the most common type of prostate cancer.\n4. Stage: The report mentions that the tumor has a stage T2c, which means it is still confined to the prostate gland but has invaded both lobes.\n5. Grade: The grade is not explicitly mentioned in the report, but it can be inferred from the Gleason score of 7 (3+4), which indicates a moderately differentiated tumor.\n6. Behavior: Malignant, as it is an adenocarcinoma with a Gleason score of 7.\n\nJustification: The site is inferred from the context, laterality is not provided, histology is mentioned as adenocarcinoma, stage is explicitly stated as T2c, grade is inferred from the Gleason score, and behavior is malignant based on the Gleason score and the fact that it is an adenocarcinoma."

The right anterior surface of the prostate is \ninked blue, the left anterior surface is inked green, and the posterior surface is inked black. The prostatic \napex, bladder neck, and seminal vesicles/vasa are trimmed. The prostate is divided into right and left \nhalves and is sectioned from apex to bladder neck. In the apical third of the right prostate, there is a 0.7 \ncm circumscribed area of firm yellowish discoloration suggestive of neoplasm. There is very patchy, small, \nyellowish discoloration of the corresponding portion of the left apical prostate. The prostatic gland \nparenchyma is otherwise tan and shows bulging yellow nodularity in the periurethral region bilaterally. \nAlso in the specimen container are three cylindrical fragments of pale tan tissue suggestive of portions of \nvasa varying from 1.1-1.8 cm in length and up to 0.4 cm in diameter.

The tumor is located in right anterolateral, right lateral,\nright posterolateral, right posterior, mid posterior and left posterior peripheral zone. The tumor focus measures 2.5 x 2.0 cm in the\nlargest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in the three cross sections of the prostate, focally in the apex and extensively in\nthe base region. The tumor exhibits multifocal extensive extraprostatic extension. At the site of extraprostatic extension, the\nmargin of resection is free of tumor. The areas of extraprostatic extension include the right lateral surface, right posterior surface,\nright superior neurovascular bundle region and base (bladder neck) area. The tumor extensively invades the right seminal vesicle\n(extraprostatic portion )and focally perivesicular soft tissue .The tumor extends to the cauterized margin of resection on the\nanterior bladder neck. The added length of cauterized tumor at the margin is approximately 6.0 mm. Focal extension to the\nperivesicular cauterized margin cannot be unequivocally excluded.\nPlease refer to the previous report for the diagnosis of the lymph nodes.\nGROSS DESCRIPTION\n(E) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES (BLACK STITCH MARKS LOCATION OF FROZEN) - A specimen consisting of a\nprostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles and attached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.\nThe prostate gland (5.1 x 3.2 x 3.4 cm, 35 grams, post-fixation) has the usual shape. The soft tissue present along the\nright posterolateral aspect of the prostate appears more abundant than along the left side. A nodule is palpated in the right base\nregion. Serial cross sections after fixation demonstrate a firm area consistent with tumor in the right peripheral zone of the second\nand third cross sections of the prostate.\nThe seminal vesicles and segments of vasa deferentia are grossly free of tumor.\nSECTION CODE: E1-E6, right seminal vesicle and segment of right vas deferens from the base towards the tip; E7-E11, Page: 4\nSpecimen Date/Time:\nleft seminal vesicle and segment of left vas deferens from the base towards the tip; E12 ,El 3, prostatic base, right border;\nE14-E17 ,prostatic base ,right posterior border ;El 8-E22 ,prostatic base, central portion; E23, E24 ,prostatic base ,left border; E25,\nE26, prostatic base ,left posterior border ;E27, apex anterior ;E28, E29 ,apex left; E30, E31, apex posterior ;E32, apex right;\nE33-E44 ,sections of the three cross sections of the prostate according to the specimen radiograph.\nThe anterior aspect of the prostate is inked in green ,left surface in red ,right surface in yellow and posterior surface in\nblack .Blue ink (E20-22 ,24, 25 and 28) and orange ink (E41 and 42 )denote surfaces that do not represent the true margin of\nresection.\nSNOMED CODES:.\nEntire report and diagnosis completed by:\n------END OF REPORT ------\n_Gitaria\nIliag r,osi<.

The dominant tumor focus is located in the right lateral, right posterolateral and right posterior peripheral zone. This tumor\nfocus measures 2.0 x 1.0 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension, and it is present in two cross sections and extensively in the\napex and base regions. This tumor focus invades the right seminal vesicle, including intra and extraprostatic portions, and focally\nperivesicular soft tissue. The margins of resection are free of tumor. The second tumor focus is located in the left lateral, left\nposterolateral and left posterior peripheral zone. This tumor focus measures 1.5 x 0.4 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension\nand it is present in two cross sections and focally in the apex and base regions. The third tumor focus is located in the right\ntransition zone. This tumor focus measures 1.0 x 1.0 cm in the largest cross section dimension and it is present in two cross\nsections, extensively in the apex and focally in the base region. The fourth tumor focus is located in the left transition zone. This\ntumor focus measures 0.1 x less than 0.1 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in the first cross section of\nthe prostate. The non-dominant tumor foci are lower histologic grade and confined to the prostate with negative margins.\nGROSS DESCRIPTION\n(C) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A prostate ,attached right and left seminal vesicles and attached segmentsof right\nand left deferentia.\nThe prostate gland (4.7 x 3.3 x 4.0 cm, 33.0 gm, postfixation) has the usual shape .The soft tissue present along the right\nposterolateral aspect of the prostate appears more abundant than along the left side. Nodules are palpated on the right side of the\nprostate and left mid region .Serial cross sections after fixation demonstrate a firm area consistentwith tumor in the right\nperipheral zone of the two cross sections of the prostate.\nThe seminal vesicles and segments of vasa deferentia are grossly free of tumor.\nSECTION CODE: C1, C2, rightseminal vesicle and segment of right vas deferens from the base towardsthe tip; C3, C4,\nleft seminal vesicle and segment of left vas deferens from the base towards thetip;C5, prostatic base right border ;C6-C10, Page: 3\nSpecimen Date /Time--m\nprostatic base right posterior border; C11-C16, prostatic base central portion; C17, prostatic base left border; C18-C21, prostatic\nbase left posterior border; C22-C24, apex anterior; C25, C26, apex left; C27, C28, apex posterior; C29, C30, apex right; C31,\ndetached portions of margin of resection according to specimen radiograph; C32-C39, sections of the two cross sections of the\nprostate according to specimen radiograph.\nThe anterior aspect of the prostate is inked in green, left surface in red, right surface in yellow and posterior surface inblack.Orange ink (C36) denotes surfaces that do not represent the true margin of resection.\nSNOMED CODES\nEntire report and diagnosis completed by:\n------END OF REPORT ------\nuiagnosis D:srrAp., nc '^-\n?^imar 7;umor5 rte Disrrenancv\nI-,TPAA Oikcre _ a ncj\nf'r Ih'^liennnc; Itist.o^\n-L'2 15 ;nchrr.nous P:rniry\nCase is lcircle):\nR=eirwei initial",

PROSTATE \nReceived fresh labeled with the patient's identification and designated \"prostate\" is a resected prostate \ngland weighing 49 g and measuring 5-cm from right to left, 4-cm from anterior to posterior, and 3.3-cm \nfrom apex to base. The external capsule is red smooth and intact. Ink code: Apex-red, anterior-orange, \nbase-blue, posterior-black, right-green, left-yellow. The apex and base are removed from the specimen \nyielding a new weight of 22 g. The specimen is serially sectioned from apex to base. Cut section \nshows firm light tan fibrous parenchyma. The right and left seminal vesicle measure 1.6 x 1.4 x 0.4 cm, \nand 2.5 x 1.4 x 0.4 cm, respectively. Both are bisected to show beige tan cystic tissue. The right and left \nvas measure 2.3 x 0.7 cm, and 1.8 x 0.6 cm, respectively. Both are sectioned to show firm tan tube \nstructure.

NOTE: The tumor in this prostate was high grade and high volume with an aggressive pattern of \ninfiltration at the capsular surface. The vast majority of the tumor was Gleason grade 4. In some areas \nthere was a significant component (>5%) of grade 5 tumor, while in other areas there was a significant \ncomponent (>5%) of grade 3 tumor. As an individual tumor pattern the grade 3 and grade 5 tumor \ncomponents were each more 5% of the total tumor, but certainly each was much less than the grade 4 \ncomponent. Adenocarcinoma was present at the inked surgical margin of resection in multiple foci that \nare defined in the synoptic report. The seminal vesicles showed extensive involvement by tumor and \nalso showed deposition of amorphous material consistent with amyloidosis. \nB.

The\ndominant tumor focus is located in the right anterior, right anterolateral, right lateral, right posterolateral, right posterior, mid\nposterior, left posterior, left posterolateral ,left lateral and left anterolateral peripheral zone. This tumor focus measures 2.9 x 2.1\ncm in the largest cross -sectional dimension and it is present in the three cross sections of the prostate, extensively in the apex and\nfocally in the base. In the left anterolateral apical region, this tumor focus extends focally to less than 0.1 mm from the inked\nmargin of resection. Focal marginal involvement cannot be unequivocally excluded. The second tumor focus is located in the left\nand right transition zone .This tumor focus measures 0.9 x 0 .6 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in the\nthree cross sections of the prostate and focally in the apex. This tumor focus is confined to the prostate with negative margins.\nGROSS DESCRIPTION\n(G) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A specimen consisting of a prostate ,attached right and left seminal vesicles and\nattached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.\nThe prostate gland (4.0 x 2.2 x 3.8 cm, 28. 0 grams ,post fixation) has the usual shape .The soft tissue present along the\nleft posterolateral aspect of the prostate appears more abundant than along the right side. A nodule is palpated on the left apex.\nSerial cross sections after fixation demonstrate an area consistent with tumor in the right peripheral zone of the first two of the\nthree cross sections of the prostate.\nThe seminal vesicles and segments of vasa deferentia are grossly free of tumor.\nSECTION CODE: G1, G2, base of right seminal vesicle and right vas deferens ;G3, G4 ,base of left seminal vesicle and\nleft vas deferens; G5, prostatic base, right border ;G6, G7, prostatic base ,right posterior border ;G8-G1 1, prostatic base ,central\nportion; G12, prostatic base ,left border ;G13, G14, prostatic base ,left posterior border ;G15, apex anterior ;G16, G17, apex left; Page: 4\n(180.0cm 105.7kg BSA: 2.3m2\nSpecimen Date/Time:\nG18-G20, apex posterior; G21, G22, apex right; G23-G34, sections of the three cross sections of the prostate according to\nspecimen radiograph.\nThe anterior aspect of the prostate is inked in green, left surface in red, right surface in yellow and posterior surface in\nblack.

Initially received in the fresh state for tumor bank study is a 42 gram \nradical prostatectomy , 5.1 cm apex to base, 3.4 cm across and 3.2 cm posterior -anterior. The attached \nright seminal vesicle extends up to 2.7 x 1.4 x 0.5 cm, adjacent vas 1.4 x 0.4 cm: the left seminal vesicle \nextends up to 3.0 x 1.4 x 0.5 cm and corresponding vas 1.9 x 0.4 cm. The prostate margin has a shaggy, \npink and tan appearance and the margins are now differentially inked as follows: posterior -black, right \nbody prostate _ blue and remaining left body prostate green. Sectioning through the bilateral seminal \nvesicles demonstrate rubbery honeycomb , pink and tan cut surface without gross tumor involvement. The \nprostate is serially sectioned , apex to base, demonstrating a variegated rubbery, mildly congested, pink \nand yellow-tan cut surface with circumscribed nodularity predominating the anterior half of the specimen \nagainst the urethral tract. A suspicious focus of glistening deep yellow change is appreciated near the left \napical and posterior margins upwards of 1.0 x 0.9 x 0.8 cm. Representative portion of this suspicious \nlesion is submitted for tumor bank. Further examination of the cut sections of prostate demonstrate \nadditional foci of suspicious yellow-orange change posterior to the urethral tract near the base, upwards of \n0.5 cm, and the origin of the right seminal vesicles demonstrates an additional 0.5 cm focus of suspicion \nfor malignancy. Tissue included within the container are two oriented tubular fragments of apparent vas \ndeferens, 2.3 x 0.5 cm and 2.5 x 0.4 em each. Representative sections are submitted for microscopic \nevaluation. \nCassette summary : A 1) unoriented vas deferens segments represented , A2) right and left vas margins and \nseminal vesicles represented, A3-A4) right and left apex sections submitted , respectively , A5-A6) right and \nleft base sections submitted , respectively, A7 -A 11) representation of right body of prostate, apex towards \nbase, A12-A18) representation left body of prostate, apex towards base._ \nMicroscopic Description: \nMicroscopic sections have been examined .

The patient undergoes a radical retropubic nerve -sparing\nprostatectomy with bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection.\nGross Description\nThe specimen is received in five parts, each labeled with the patient 's name and unit number .Parts A-C\nand E are received in formalin ;Part D is received fresh.\nPart A .additionally labeled \"right pelvic lymph nodes ,\"consists of two soft-to -firm, yellow -tan, fibrofatty\ntissue fragments measuring 3 x 2 x 1.0 cm in aggregate .A single lymph node candidate Is identified,\nbisected ,and submitted in cassette Al. The entire fibrofatty remnant is submitted in cassette A2.\nPart B ,additionally labeled \"left pelvic lymph nodes .\"consists of multiple segments of soft, irregular,\nyellow- tan, fibrofatty tissue fragments measuring 6.5 x 4 x 1 cm in aggregate .Multiple lymph node\ncandidates are identified and submitted as follows:\nCassettes B1-B2 : One lymph node candidate ,bisected.\nCassette B3: One lymph node candidate ,bisected.\nCassette B4: Two lymph node candidates ,bisected.\nCassette B5: Multiple small lymph node candidates submitted Intact.\nPart C, additionally labeled \"posterior bladder neck,\" consists of a single irregular ,unoriented,\noff-white /tan tissue fragment measuring 0.7 x 0.7 x 0.4 cm. The entire specimen is submitted in\ncassette Cl.\nPart D is received fresh additionally labeled \"prostate and seminal vesicle \".It consists of a single intact\nprostate gland with attached seminal vesicle /vas deferens bundles weighing 50.5 grams and measuring\n4.3 cm from apex to base ,4.4 cm from medial to lateral and 4.9 cm from anterior to posterior. The\nexterior of the gland is roughened ,red-tan and glistening .Sutures are noted along the anterior\nmidline ,closing the dorsal vein complex .The seminal vesicle /vas deferens bundles are soft ,whorled,\nred-tan and without lesion or mass .The right anterior surface of the gland is inked green ;the left\nanterior surface is inked blue ;and the posterior surface is inked black .The specimen is bisected\nperpendicular to the urethral channel ,and tissue Is banked for research /tissue banking purposes. The\ntwo halves of the specimen are subsequently glued together, and the specimen is fixed prior to further\nsectioning .Following fixation ,the bladder margin is removed ,and the remainder of the gland is serially\nsectioned perpendicular to the urethral channel from apex to base into eight serial slices .The serial\nslices reveal a large ,solid, off -white/yellow tumor located centrally along the posterior aspect of the\ngland ,which measures 3.0 cm In greatest dimension and grossly abuts the posterior and prostatic\ncapsule .A small ,ovoid ,0.4-cm, periprostatic nodule Is noted in the left posterior -lateral aspect of\nserial slices #7-8. This nodule contains a yellow -tan discoloration ,which is suspicious for extracapsular tumor .Further dissection reveals gross tumor invading both of the seminal vesicle /vas deferens\nbundles .The apical and bladder margins ,as well as representative sections of the prostate and seminal\nvesicles ,are submitted as follows:\nApical Margin:\nCassette D1: Right apex, 1.2 o'clock to 6 o'clock, breadloafed and submitted entirely.\nCassette D2: Left apex, 6 o'clock to 12 o'clock, breadloafed and submitted entirely.\nRight Anterior Quadrant:\nCassette D3: Serial slice #3.\nCassette D4: Serial slice #5.\nCassette D5: Serial slice #7.\nRight Posterior Quadrant:\nCassette D6: Serial slice #3.\nCassette D7: Serial slice #5.\nCassette D8: Serial slice #7.\nLeft Posterior Quadrant:\nCassette D9: Serial slice #3.\nCassette D10: Serial slice *5.\nCassette D 11: Serial slice #7.\nLeft Anterior Quadrant:\nCassette D12: Serial slice #3.\nCassette D13: Serial slice #5.\nCassette D14: Serial slice #7.\nBladder Margin:\nCassette D15: Right lateral bladder margin.\nCassette D16: Central bladder margin.\nCassette D17: Left lateral bladder margin.\nProstatic /Seminal Vesicle 3unction:\nCassette D18: Right seminal vesicle and cross section of vas deferens.\nCassette D19: Left seminal vesicle and cross section of vas deferens.\nPart E ,additionally labeled \"posterior urethra ,\"consists of a single irregular ,unoriented ,tan-brown\ntissue fragment measuring 0.6 x 0 .4 x 0.3 cm in greatest dimension.

A minute focus of tumor with histologic features similar to the tumor present in the transition is\nalso present in the right posterolateral peripheral zone. This tumor focus is considered an intraprostatic metastasis. The tumor\nexhibits extraprostatic extension in the anterior surface of the prostate and in the apical region. The tumor extends to the margin of\nresection in multiple apical sections and in the anterior surface of the first prostatic cross sections. The added length of marginal\ninvolvement is 15.0 mm.\nPlease refer to the previous report for the diagnosis of the pelvic lymph nodes.\nGROSS DESCRIPTION\n(D) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles and attached segments of right\nand left vasa deferentia.\nThe prostate gland (3.2 x 3.3 x 4.3 cm, 33 gm, post-fixation) has the usual shape. The soft tissue present along the right\nposterolateral aspect of the prostate appears more abundant than along the left side.

        "llm_output": " Based on the pathology report, here is the information organized into the six categories:\n\n1. Site: The site of the cancer is the prostate gland. This is evident from the gross description and diagnosis sections of the report.\n2. Laterality: Not provided. The report does not mention any laterality of the tumor, meaning it could be located in any part of the prostate gland.\n3. Histology: The histology of the cancer is adenocarcinoma. This is stated in the diagnosis section of the report.\n4. Stage: The stage of the cancer is not explicitly provided in the report. However, based on the description of extraprostatic extension and involvement of the surgical margin, it can be inferred that the cancer is at least stage T3a.\n5. Grade: The grade of the cancer is Gleason score 9 (5+4). This is stated in the diagnosis section of the report.\n6. Behavior: The behavior of the cancer is malignant, meaning it can invade and destroy nearby tissue, spread to other parts of the body, and possibly cause death. This is implied throughout the report.\n\nJustification for the choices:\n\nThe site of the cancer is identified as the prostate gland because it is the organ from which the specimen was taken and the tumor was found in the prostate gland during gross examination. Laterality is not provided because the report does not mention any specific location within the prostate gland where the tumor is located. The histology of the cancer is adenocarcinoma because that is what the pathologist diagnosed based on microscopic examination of the specimen. The stage of the cancer is inferred to be at least T3a because the report mentions extraprostatic extension and involvement of the surgical margin, which are characteristics of T3a tumors. The grade of the cancer is Gleason score 9 (5+4) because that is what the pathologist reported based on microscopic examination of the specimen. Finally, the behavior of the cancer is malignant because it can invade and destroy nearby tissue, spread to other parts of the body, and possibly cause death, as implied by the report's description of extraprostatic extension and involvement of the surgical margin."

The length of extraprostatic tumor is less than 2.0 mm. The margins of resection are free of tumor. This\ntumor exhibits marked perineural invasion including nerve trunks present at the edge between the prostate and extraprostatic\ntissue .No other areas of unequivocal extraprostatic extension are identified. The second tumor focus is located in the transition\nzone ,exclusively in the anterior and right apical region .This tumor focus measures 0.5 x 0 .2 cm in the largest cross sectional\ndimension and it is present in three apical sections .This tumor focus is of lower histologic grade (Gleason score 6/3 + 3) and it is\nconfined to the prostate.\nThe diagnosis for the symphysis pubic bone (part C )reflects the opinion of from the section of orthopedic\npathology.\nGROSS DESCRIPTION\nC) SYMPHYSIS PUBIC BONE -Multiple fragments of bone and admixed soft tissue (5.0 x 3 .0 x 1.0 cm in aggregate ).Remainder\nof the specimen is submitted for further histologic processing to the bone lab.\nSECTION CODE: C 1-C3, entire soft tissue . .C4-C7, representative sections of the bone.\n(D) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A specimen consisting of a prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles and\nattached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.\nThe prostate gland (4.5 x 3.4 x 3.9 cm, 37.5 gm ,post fixation )has the usual shape .The soft tissue present along the right\nand left posterolateral aspects of the prostate appears symmetrical .The tumor is palpated on the right posterolateral and left\nposterolateral aspects of the prostate .Serial cross sections after fixation demonstrate a firm area consistent with tumor in the left\nperipheral zone of the first to the third cross sections.

The specimen is carefully searched\nrevealing a single predominantly fatty, 2.2 cm lymph node which is\nbisected and entirely submitted in cassette Al.\nThe second specimen is received in formalin additionally designated\n\"right pelvic lymph node\" and consists of a single fragment of\nfibrofatty tissue measuring 3 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm. The specimen is\ncarefully searched revealing a single predominantly fatty 2.5 cm\nlymph node which is bisected and entirely submitted in cassette B1.\nThe third specimen is received fresh from then OR additionally\ndesignated \"prostate\" and consists of a 79.9-gram, 5.9 x 4.5 x 4.4\ncm prostatectomy specimen with an attached left seminal vesicle\nmeasuring 1.5 x 1 x 0.6 cm. There is a stump of the right seminal\nvesicle measuring 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.4 cm. The specimen is inked as\nfollows: the anterior aspect is inked green, the left posterior\naspect is inked blue, and the right posterior aspect is inked black.\nThe apical and bladder neck margins are removed. The specimen is\nthen serially sectioned from apex to base at 3 mm intervals\nrevealing an asymmetrical prostate with the right lobe being larger\nthan the left lobe. There is a firm, dense, suspicious nodule in\nthe right posterior prostate measuring up to 2 cm in greatest\ndimension. The remaining prostate is somewhat rubbery and nodular\nwith several cystic-like areas. Representative tissue is taken for\nresearch purposes by epresentative sections\nare submitted as follows: cassette C1 bladder neck margin en face,\ncassette C2 left apical margin serially sectioned, cassette C3 right\napical margin serially sectioned, cassettes C4-C8 representative\nsections of left prostate from apex to base, cassettes C9-C13\nrepresentative sections of right prostate from apex to base\n(cassette C9 is corresponding half of prostate, cassette C4 etc.),\ncassette C14 section of left prostate and seminal vesicle, cassette\nPrinted by Page 1 of 4 Page 2 of 4\nC15 representative section of left seminal vesicle, cassette C16\njunction of right prostate seminal vesicle, cassette C17\nrepresentative sections of right seminal vesicle.\nCOMMENT: Histologic sections demonstrate high-grade prostatic\nadenocarcinoma, with a component of the tumor demonstrating mucinous\nfeatures.

The\ndominant tumor focus is located in the right lateral , right posterolateral, right posterior, mid posterior and left posterior peripheral\nzone.This tumor focus measures 2.5 x 2.0 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in the single cross\nsection of the prostate and extensively in the apex and base. The tumor exhibits extensive extraprostatic extension in the right\nposterolateral surface of the prostate and right superior neurovascular bundle region. The added length of extraprostatic extension\nis 18.5 mm. On the right base, focal extension of tumor to the cauterized margin cannot be unequivocally excluded. The second\ntumor focus is located in the left transition zone .This tumor focus measures 0.8 x 0.3 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension\nand it is present in the single cross section of the prostate, focally in the apex and extensively in the base. This tumor focus is of\nlower histologic grade and confined to the prostate with negative margins.\nGROSS .DESCRIPTION\n(A) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A specimen consisting of a prostate ,attached right and left seminal vesicles and\nattached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.\nThe prostate gland (5.1 x 3. 1x 3.9 cm ,28.0 grams ,post-fixation) has the usual shape .The soft tissue present along the\nposterolateral aspects of the prostate is abundant and symmetrical .A nodule is palpated on the right side of the prostate .Serial\ncross -sections after fixation demonstrate an area consistent with tumor in the right side of the single cross-section of the prostate.\nThe seminal vesicles and segments of vasa deferentia are grossly free of tumor.\nSECTION CODE: Al-A4, right seminalvesicle and segment of right vas deferens from the base towards the tip;A5-A7,\nleft seminal vesicle and segment of left vas deferens from the base towards the tip; A8, prostatic base,right border ;A9-A12,\nprostatic base ,right posterior border ;A13-A20, prostatic base ,central portion ;A21, prostatic base, left border ;A22-A24\nprostatic base ,left posterior border ;A25-A26, apex anterior ;A27-A28 , apex left; A29- A31, apex posterior ;A32-A33, apex right;\nA34-A37,sections of the single cross-section of the prostate according to the specimen radiograph.\nThe anterior aspect of the prostate is inked in green ,left surface in red ,right surface in yellow and posterior surface in Page: 3\nSpecimen Date/Time:\nblack.\nSNOMED CODES\nT-92000 ,M-Y1973\nEntire report and diagnosis completed by:\n------END OF REPORT------\nCriteria\ndiagnosis ! )iscre^ancy .\nPrimaryf`rnor Sire f--_^\nryiV:> i)i;: `epar^cy\nU^31j5t\u2022n^ ir__\n^_. pn ^^sp any WD\ni as\u2022 is (tA^l\u201eI;",

Firm nodularity is centered in the right apex region, but\nvague nodularity persists throughout the sectioned prostate. Near the right base there is a 1.4 cm circular,\ndark black, gray,. firm nodule. The apex most slice is removed and is serially longitudinally sectioned and\nsubmitted from right to left in cassettes Al-A9. The remaining body of the prostate is sectioned and\nsubmitted according to the University protocol in its entirely in cassettes A10-A52. The right seminal\nvesicle is serially sectioned and submitted sequentially in casettes A53-A60. The left seminal vesicle is\nsimilarly sectioned and submitted serially from A61-A68.\n(B) (bilateral pelvic lymph nodes) Received in formalin is a mass of adipose tissue with embedded\ncandidate lymph nodes measuring 11.0 x 7.0 x 3.0 cm.

This tumor focus measures 0.1 x < 0.1 cm in the largest\ncross sectional dimension and it is present in one cross section. All tumor foci are confined to the prostate. The margins of\nresection are free of tumor.\nGROSS DESCRIPTION\n(C) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A specimen consisting a prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles and\nattached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.\nThe prostate gland (4.2 x 2.8 x 3.7 cm, 48 grams, post-fixation), has the usual shape. The soft tissue present along the\nright and left posterolateral aspects of the prostate appears symmetrical. No tumor is palpated externally or observed in the cross\nsections after fixation.\nThe seminal vesicles and segments of vasa deferentia are grossly free of tumor.\nSECTION CODE: C1, C2, right seminal vesicle and segment of right vas deferens from the base towards the tip; C3, C4,\nleft seminal vesicle and segment of left vas deferens from the base towards the tip; C5, prostatic base right border; C6, C7,\nprostatic base right posterior border; C8-C13, prostatic base central portion; C14, prostatic base left border; C15, C16, prostatic\nbase left posterior border, C17-C20, apex anterior; C21, C22, apex left; C23-C25, apex posterior; C26, apex right; C27-C42,\nsections of the four cross sections of the prostate according to specimen radiograph.\nThe anterior aspect of the prostate is inked green, left surface in red, right surface in yellow and posterior surface in block.\nBlue ink (C17-26) denotes surfaces but do not represent the true margin of resection. ------END OF REP ORT------\nCriteriaYes\n-\"tF--r-Dia sis Digno screpancy\nPrLna, y Tum,;r Site Discrepancy\nk PAA Uisc. epancy\nPrinr MdIignancy History\nD-,al/`ynch,o.:uu; Primary Notre T_ ,\nCa se :c ;^_irua) 0 ALIH / C:SQUALIff D\nReviewer fnitiaDat+ RerieweJ:",

The tumor focus measures\n3.5 x 1.0 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in the three cross sections of the prostate, extensively in the\napex and focally in the base region. In the left posterior surface of the prostate, tumor extends focally (less than 1.0 mm) to the\ninked margin of resection. No extraprostatic tissue is present at the site of the positive margin to evaluate the possible presence of\nextraprostatic extension.\nGROSS DESCRIPTION\n(C) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A specimen consisting of a prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles, and\nattached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.\nThe prostate gland (5.1 x 4.5 x 5.7 cm, 95 grams, post fixation) has the usual shape .The soft tissue present along the\nright posterolateral aspect of the prostate appears more abundant than along the left side. A palpable nodule is present in the right\nposterolateral aspect of the prostate in the mid region. A well circumscribed nodule (3.3 x 3.0 x 3.0 cm) protrudes from the base of\nthe prostate around the urethra. Serial cross sections after fixation demonstrate a firm area in the right peripheral zone of the\nsecond and third cross sections.\nThe seminal vesicles and segments of vasa deferentia are grossly free of tumor.\nSECTION CODE: C1-C4, right seminal vesicle and segment of right vas deferens from the base towards the tip; B5-B7,\nleft seminal vesicle and segment of left vas deferens from the base towards the tip; C8, C9, median lobe; C10, C11, prostatic base\nright border; C12-C14, prostatic base right posterior border; C15-C21, prostatic base central portion posterior aspect from right to\nleft; C22-C27, prostatic base central portion, anterior aspect, alternating sections from right to left; C28 - C33, prostatic base left\nborder; C34, see diagram; C35-C37, prostatic base left posterior border; C38-C40, apex anterior; C41, C42, apex left; C43-C45,\napex posterior; C46, C47, apex right; C48, detached portions of margin of resection according to specimen radiograph; C49-C60,\nsections of the three cross sections of the prostate according to specimen radiograph.\nThe anterior aspect of the prostate is inked in green, left surface in red, right surface in yellow, and posterior surface in\nblack.

The\ndominant tumor focus is located in the right lateral , right posterolateral and right posterior peripheral zone. This tumor focus\nmeasures 2.5 x 0.6 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in the four cross sections of the prostate,\nextensively in the apex and focally in the base region. The tumor exhibits extensive multifocal extraprostatic extension.\nExtraprostatic extension is present in the right lateral, right posterolateral surface of the prostate and right superior neurovascular\nbundle region. The added length of extraprostatic extension is 23.0 mm. The margins of resection are free of tumor. The second\ntumor focus is located in the left lateral and left posterolateral peripheral zone. This tumor focus measures 1.0 x 0.1 cm in the\nlargest cross -sectional dimension and it is present in two cross sections .The third tumor focus is located in the left transition zone.\nThis tumor focus measures less than 0.1 x less than 0.1 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in one cross\nsection.

The\ndominant tumor focus is located in the right lateral, right posterolateral ,right posterior, mid posterior and left posterior peripheral\nzone. This tumor focus measures 1.4 x 0 .5 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in the first two cross\nsections of the prostate and extensively in the apical region. This tumor focus exhibits predominantly Gleason grades 4 and 3. A\nminor component of Gleason grade 5 is present. This tumor exhibits an extensive cribriform pattern and also intraductal spread.\nThe presence of intraductal spread is confirmed by a stain for basal cell markers and racemase (PIN 3). The second tumor focus\nis located in the left and right transition zone. This tumor focus measures 1.1 x 0.3 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension\nand it is present in two cross sections ,and focally in the base region .The third tumor focus is located in the right anterolateral and\nright lateral peripheral zone .This tumor focus measures 1.0 x 0.1 cm in the largest cross -sectional dimension and it is present in\none cross section. The fourth tumor focus is located in the right transition zone. This tumor focus measures less than 0.2 x 0.1\ncm in the largest cross -sectional dimension ,and it is present in the first cross section and focally in the apical region.\nAll tumor foci are confined to the prostate. The margins of resection are free of tumor.

The patient undergoes robot-assisted laparoscopic radical\nprostatectomy with bilateral pelvic lymph node dissections.\nGross Description\nThe specimen is received in three parts, each labeled with the patient's name and unit number. Parts A\nand B are received in formalin and Part C Is received fresh.\nPart A ,additionally labeled \"bladder neck margin ,\"consists of three irregular, tan-brown ,heavily\ncauterized ,unoriented tissue fragments measuring 1.8 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm in aggregate. The specimen is\nentirely submitted in cassette Al.\nPart B ,additionally labeled \"right pelvic lymph nodes,\" consists of a single irregular fragment of\nyellow -tan fibrofatty tissue measuring 3.7 x 2. 5 x 0.8 cm.

The dominant tumor focus although not the one of the highest histologic grade (Gleason score 7/3+4) is located in the left\ntransition zone. This tumor focus measures 2.0 x 1.0 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension, and it is present in one cross\nsection and extensively in the apex and base regions. This tumor focus invades the left seminal vesicle including intra and\nextraprostatic portions. Focal extraprostatic extension is present in the left superior neurovascular bundle region. The extent of\nextraprostatic tumor is less than 1.0 mm. The extraprostatic tumor is present in a perineural location. The second tumor focus\nand the one of the highest histologic grade (7/4+3 with tertiary Gleason grade 5) is located in the left lateral, left posterolateral, left\nposterior, mid posterior and right posterior peripheral zone. This tumor focus measures 1.7 x 1.2 cm in the largest cross-sectional\ndimension, and it is present in the single cross section of the prostate and extensively in the apex and base regions. The third\ntumor focus is located in the right lateral peripheral zone, exclusively in the apical region. This tumor focus measures 1.0 x 0.2 cm\nin the largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in two apical sections. Tumor foci #1 and 2 are confined to the prostate.\nThe margins of resection are free of tumor.\nPlease refer to the previous report for the diagnosis of the pelvic lymph nodes.\nGROSS DESCRIPTION\n(E) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES (INK AT F.S.

Cassettes are submitted as follows:\nCassette Bi: Multiple lymph node candidates.\nCassette B2: One lymph node candidate.\nPart C ( FS 1), labeled \"prostate and seminal vesicles (FS),\" consists of a large ,intact prostate gland with\nattached seminal vesicle /vas deferens bundles weighing 55.1 gm .The gland measures ,in maximum\ndimension ,4 cm from apex to base ,4.7 cm from medial to lateral and 3 .8 cm from anterior to posterior.\nThe exterior of the gland is rough and red-tan ,with numerous sutures along the anterior midline ,closing\nthe dorsal vein complex .Sutures are also noted at the left posterior bladder margin ,designating the site\nrequested for frozen section .Firm ,white -tan, ovoid calculi are noted bilaterally along the lateral aspect of\nthe prostate ,just underlying the most exterior fascia .The largest of the calculi measures 0.7 cm in\ngreatest dimension .There are numerous firm ,palpable nodules within the prostate noted bilaterally. The\nright anterior surface of the gland is inked in green, the left anterior surface is inked in blue, and the\nposterior surface is inked in black .A shave biopsy is taken from the left posterior bladder margin,\nbread -loafed ,and submitted for frozen section diagnosis 1. Following frozen section ,the apical and\nremaining bladder margins are removed and fixed separately ,and the remainder of the gland is serially\nsectioned from apex to base perpendicular to the urethral channel into five serial slices .The serial slices\nreveal a large ,tan to bright white ,firm ,solid ,lobulated lesion dominating the left lobe and crossing over\ninto the right lobe along the anterior aspect .This lesion essentially replaces most of the central and\ntransitional zones in all five serial slices. A small aspect of relatively normal-appearing tissue is noted in\nthe right posterior quadrant of serial slices 1-4. This area is composed of much softer ,semi-porous, light\ntan tissue .Following further dissection and submission of tissue for pathologic evaluation ,all of the\nremnant fresh prostatic tissue is taken for tissue banking /research purposes .The apical and bladder\nmargins ,as well as representative sections of prostate and representative portions of the seminal\nvesicle /vas deferens bundles are submitted as follows:\nCassette C1 (FS 1): Left posterior base.

The specimen as received weighs 51 \ngrams. On reconstruction the prostate gland is 5.5 x 4.9 x 4.6 cm \nand has a slightly shaggy lobulated outer surface. The urethra is \napproximately 4.2 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm and patent. The cut surface shows \na slightly nodular rubbery gray tan to pink fibrotic cut surface. \nNoted in the right lateral lobe in the distal region there is a \npoorly defined approximately 1.0 x 0.9 x 0.8 cm area of tan gray \nfibrosis which grossly extends to within 0.1 cm of the inked outer \nsurface margin. In the mid region of the specimen in the left \nposterior lobe there is a second poorly defined approximately 1.4 x \n1.2 x 1.0 cm area of poorly defined tan gray fibrosis with slight \ninduration. This grossly extends focally to within 0.1 cm of the \nnearest outer surface margin. No additional gross lesions are \nidentified. A more distal area of fibrosis is seen to focally \nextend to within 0.2 cm of the apical (distal) margin in the right \nlateral lobe. The more central area is greater than 1.5 cm from the \nnearest proximal (vesical) margin. The seminal vesicles together \nare 6.0 x 2.2 x 1.0 cm.

The neoplasm grows as \nraggedly infiltrating glands and as numerous individual glands \ninfiltrating into the stroma. The neoplastic cells have enlarged \nnuclei with prominent nucleoli. Numerous areas of perineural \ninvasion are seen. The neoplasm extends to the inked margin at the \napical margin and the shaved vesicle margin from the base. The \nneoplasm also extends through the capsule in several areas and the \ninked margin is involved by neoplasm along several sections from the \nright prostate.

The specimen weighs 37 grams and measures 3.5 cm from apex\nto base, 4 cm from medial to lateral and 3.5 cm from anterior to posterior. The external surface is\nrelatively smooth, red-tan and glistening. The bladder margin demonstrates extensive cautery. The\ndorsal vein complex is closed with the use of a single suture. The seminal vesicle/vas deferens bundles\nare soft, red-tan and whorled, without obvious lesion or mass. The right anterior resection margin is\nInked green. The left anterior resection margin is inked blue. The posterior resection margin is inked\nblack. An incision is made in the posterior surface between apex and midgland, with tissue being\nbanked for research purposes. The incision is glued shut, and the specimen is fixed prior to further\nsectioning. Following fixation, the bladder margin is removed, and the remainder of the gland is serially\nsectioned from apex to base perpendicular to the urethral channel Into eight serial slices. The slices\nreveal a 1.1 cm foci of bright yellow-gold, slightly lobulated tissue just anterior to the urethral channel\nin serial slices 1 and 2. Additionally, there is a solid, white-tan, 1.2-cm lesion in the right lateral aspect\nof serial slices 3 and 4. This lesion grossly abuts the lateral to posterior inked surgical margin. The\ncentral-transition zone is of normal size and appearance and composed of firm, white-tan, striated and\nnodular tissue. The peripheral zone, making up approximately two-thirds of total gland volume, is\ncomposed of softer,, semiporous, light tan tissue where unaffected by tumor.

Justified as the report states it's a prostatic adenocarcinoma.\n4. \"Stage\": T2c N0 Mx. Justified as the tumor has invaded the periprostatic tissue but not beyond, and no lymph node or distant metastasis is mentioned.\n5. \"Grade\": III (High grade or poorly differentiated). Justified as the Gleason score is 7 (4+3), which corresponds to Grade III.\n6. \"Behavior\": Malignant. Justified as it's a cancer that shows invasive growth into the surrounding tissues.\n\nPlease note that the \"RO\" in the stage indicates \"Resection margins are negative\", meaning the tumor has not spread to the surgical margins. The \"LO\" and \"YO\" in the final report indicate \"Lymphatic invasion is negative\" and \"Vascular invasion is negative\" respectively, which are not included in the TNM staging but are important prognostic factors."
