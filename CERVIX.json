Gross\nexamination only. (M)\nCLINICAL INFORMATION: stage 1 B2 adenosquamous\ncarcinoma of the cervix.\nGROSS DESCRIPTION: Number of specimen containers: five, each labeled with\npatient name and MRN\nM.\nA.Container designation: \"uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries\"\n--Received unfixed is a radical hysterectomy specimen consisting of\nuterus, cervix, attached bilateral adnexa and parametrial tissue weighing\n260 gm, measuring 13.5 x 6.5 x 6.0 cm. The anterior serosa is smooth, the\nposterior serosa demonstrates a firm subserosal yellow-gray mass in the\nbody measuring 4.5 x 2.9 x 1.0 cm. Surfacing the serosa and the mass is a\n1.0 x 0.8 x 0.6 cm cystic structure occupied by clear watery fluid. The\nposterior serosa and soft tissue margins are inked. The ectocervix is\npink-tan with purpuric changes surrounding the os 1.0 cm (tumor?) and an\nanterior/posterior vaginal identified 1.0 and 0.8 cm in Length,\nrespectively. Sectioning of the anterior cervix at the os is grossly\nunremarkable, however, the tumor extends from within 0.9 cm of the\nanterior cervical os to the fundus and appears full thickness in the lower\nuterine segment and body. The posterior aspect is similar in appearance\nto that of the anterior aspect. Sectioning of the tumor demonstrates a\nyellow-gray purulent appearance with prominent necrosis. Representative\nsections of tumor and normal are submitted to\nn. The right ovary\nmeasures 2.2 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm and sectioning demonstrates a thickened cortex\nand pink-tan mottled stroma. The pink-tan fallopian tube with fimbriated\nend measures 5.5 cm in length, 0.6 cm in external diameter and sectioning\ndemonstrates a pink-tan mottled stroma. The left ovary measures 3.0 x 1.5\nx 1.0 cm and sectioning demonstrates a pink-tan mottled stroma. The\ncorresponding pink-tan fallopian tube with fimbriated end measures 6.0 cm\nin length, 0.5 cm in external diameter and sectioning demonstrates a\npinpoint lumen. Sections are submitted as follows: cassette Al-posterior\nbody, serosa with nodule extruding; cassette A2-representative\nanterior/posterior vaginal cuff (anterior inked red, posterior green); A3- anterior cervix and ectocervix full thickness; cassette A4-anterior\nendocervical canal full thickness; cassette A5-posterior cervix full\nthickness with ectocervix; cassette A6-posterior endocervical canal;\ncassette A7-anterior body; cassette\nA8-posterior body full thickness; cassette A9-anterior fundus full\nthickness; cassette A10-posterior fundus full thickness; cassette All-\nrepresentative right ovary and fallopian tube; cassette A12-representative\nleft ovary and fallopian tube; cassette A13-parametrial tissue right\nlateral wall; cassette A144-representative parametrial tissue left lateral\nwall.\nB.Container designation: \"Right pelvic lymph node\" - Received are\nmultiple portions of fat aggregating to 3.5 x 3 x 1.5 cm.

Dispersed throughout the villoglandular\nadenocarcinoma are areas showing complex cribriform architecture. These cribriform areas represent about 10-15%\nof lesional tissue . Although stromal invasion is not definitively identified, there is essentially no normal stroma present\nwithin the biopsy tissue to exclude an invasive component.

Justification: The report clearly states that the biopsy was performed on the cervix, which is part of the uterus.\n2. \"Laterality\": Not provided. Justification: The report does not mention any laterality as it's a biopsy, not a removal of the entire organ.\n3. \"Histology\": Adenocarcinoma, well-differentiated. Justification: The report explicitly states \"Histologic section of the cervical biopsy shows a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma.\"\n4. \"Stage\": Not provided. Justification: The report does not contain any information about the tumor size, lymph node involvement, or metastasis, which are required for TNM staging.\n5. \"Grade\": Low grade or well-differentiated. Justification: The report describes the adenocarcinoma as well-differentiated, which is a low-grade cancer.\n6. \"Behavior\": Malignant.

The uterus measures 13 x 6 x 4.5 cm, the cervix measures 4 x 3 cm, the vaginal\ncuff measures 1 cm anterior and 2.2 cm posterior. The resected surface is inked black. The endocervix measures 3.5\ncm and the endometrial cavity measures 4 x 2.5 cm. A large, tan-friable , circumferential mass is seen within the\nendocervix that measures 5 x 4.5 x 1 cm.

Only rare foci of lymphovascular invasion are noted. The maximum depth of tumor invasion in the cervix\nis 0.5 cm out of a cervical wall thickness of 1.2 cm. The tumor also extends into the lower uterine segment where the\nmaximum depth of tumor invasion, seen in the anterior half, measures 0.9 cm out of a total myometrial thickness of 1.2\ncm. Even though there is extension of tumor into the lower uterine segment, thg fact that the bulk of the tumor is within\nthe endocervix is consistent with a cervical rather than an endometrial origin.\nPhD\nHistory:\nThe patient is a year old woman with cervical cancer.

Where\nrelatively well preserved, the tumor invades as large nests of moderately pleomorphic cells with abundant mucinous\ncytoplasm and a high mitotic rate. This tumor is best classified as mucinous adenocarcinoma of endocervical type,\nalthough many of the cells have signet ring features and there are small foci of endometrioid differentiation as well.\nTumor is present on virtually every section from these large biopsies and is present at multiple inked and cauterized\nmargins. Detached fragments of adenocarcinoma are present in the endocervical canal biopsy.\nHistory\nThe patient is a year old woman with cervical cancer.\nPhysician CopyPh.D.\n.TL5-d-3Page 1 of 2\nID/l6/13 auKtiILAL P A 111ULU(.

The uterusmeasures about 8\ncm from the fundus to the ectocervix, 5 cm from cornu to cornu, and\na maximumof 5 cm from the anterior to the posterior surface.\nExternal examination of thespecimen is remarkable for a 2.5 x 1.0 cm\ntransmural defect with an irregular shaggy border involving the\nanterior endocervix. The margins of the tissues bordering the\ndefect are inked blue.The rest of the serosal surface of the\nuterus is tan-pink, intact, and relatively smooth. The paracervical\nsoft tissuesare focally involved by tumor. The margin of the\nof the vaginal cuff is painted with black ink. The cervix is\nvirtually replaced by an exophytic and endophytic tumor that focally\nprotrudes through the external os. The tumor is circumferential,\nabout 3.5 cm in diameter, and involves about a 3.5 cm long segment\nof tissue extending from the lower uterine segment into the wall\nof the upper vagina. The mucosal aspect of the tumor is amber-\ntan to reddish-tan and ulcerated. The endocervical canal shows\nsubtotal stenosiswith obstruction due to occupation by tumor.On\ncut sections, the tumor involves the entire wall of the cervix and\nhas a maximum thickness of about 2.0 cm. Invasion of the wall of\nthe anterior lower uterine segment by tumor is also nearly full\nthickness.Invasion of the wall of the posterior lower uterine\nsegment is less.The tumor invades the wall of the upper vagina.\nInvolvement of the vaginal wall is nearly full thickness. Tumor\nwithin the wall of the vagina extends very close to the vaginal cuff\nmargin, inferiorly.The overlying vaginal mucosa is tan-pink and\nappears grossly uninvolved by tumor. Little, grossly uninvolved\ntan, intact squamous epithelium is grossly evident in the cervix.\nAs stated above, the endocervix is virtually replaced by tumor. The\nendometrial cavity is about 4 cm in length and has a maximum width\nof about 2.5 cm. The endometrium lining the uterine corpus and\nfundus is tan, smooth and has a maximum thickness of about 0.1 cm.\nThe uterine wall measures about 2.2 cm in maximum thickness.

Central necrosis within the\nhttps:/ \u2022'.. -Clinical Document: I Page 2 of 3\nnests is prominent. The tumor cells have a high nuclear to\ncytoplasmic ratio with nuclei containing loose chromatin and\nsmall nucleoli. Mitotic figures are abundant.\nGROSS DESCRIPTION:\nThe specimen is received fresh in five containers bearing\nthe patient' s name and hospital number.\nPart #1, labeled \"uterus and cervix,\" consists of a 1128-gm\nuterus and cervix with no attached adnexa. The uterus\nmeasures 14.5 cm from cornu to cornu, 17 cm from cervical os\nto top of fundus, and 9 cm from anterior to posterior. A\nprobe extends into the cervical os 14.5. The cervix is\nround with a defect in the posterior 6 o'clock position.\nThe defect appears to be within a lesion that is 3.5 cm from\nlateral to lateral and is 2 cm from anterior to posterior\nand involves the entire posterior aspect of the cervix. The\ndefect appears as a chunk out of this lesion that is 1.5 cm\ndeep and 1.5 cm on its side. The cervix itself is 5 cm from\nlateral to lateral and 4 cm anterior to posterior. There is\n2 cm of attached vaginal wall that is attached from the 6\no'clock to the 9 o'clock position. On the anterior and left\nside there is approximately 1 cm of attached vaginal wall.\nThe serosa on the uterus is pink and unremarkable. The left\nparametrium is inked with black ink and the right\nparametrium is inked with green ink. Upon opening the\nuterus, the cervical canal measures 3.5 cm and the\nendometrial cavity is 10.5 cm vertically and 7 cm at its\nwidest point. The endometrial cavity is covered with a\nboggy, hemorrhagic-appearing endometrium. The myometrium is\nthick and boggy-appearing. The maximum thickness is 3.5 cm.\nThe cervix is dissected away from the specimen and entirely\nsubmitted as follows:\nAl-A6 12 o'clock to 3 o'clock\nA7-A13 3o'clock to 6 o'clock\nA14-A24 6o'clock to 9 o'clock\nA25-A30 9 o'clock to 12 o'clock\nA31-A36 right parametrium\nA37-A39 left parametrium\nA40-A47 uterus\nPart #2, labeled \"right pelvic lymph node,\" consists of two\nfragments of fibroadipose tissue.

Sections from the transition zone of the cervix\ndemonstrate previous biopsy site changes in addition to mu tfocal\nareas of squamous cell carcinoma in situ. These changes are also\nseen in most sections from the lower uterine segment and\nendometrium. Invasive squamous cell carcinoma erodes through the\ncervical stroma and is present at the paracervical soft tissue\nmargins of resection, as well as adjacent to the distal\n(paravaginal) margins of resection (considered positive margins. The\nmyometrium is diffusely involved by invasive squamous cell\ncarcinoma, with extension to the serosal surfaces. In the right\nfundic region, carcinoma invades into the serosal surfaces of the\nterminal ileum and appendix with extension through the muscularis\npropria and towards the mucosal surfaces. The right oophorectomy\nspecimen demonstrates invasive squamous cell carcinoma (similar to\nthat seen elsewhere), secondarily involving a pre-existing\ncystadenofibroma. The possibility of direct spread of the carcinoma\nfrom the uterus to the right ovary cannot be excluded (versus\nmetastatic spread or \"co-synchronous primary\". The tumor appears\nhigh grade with significant tumor-associated necrosis,\nangiolymphatic vascular space invasion and a high rate of mitotic\nactivity.\nHISTORY: Cervical carcinoma\nMICROSCOPIC:\nSee Diagnosis.\nGROSS:\n1: BLADDER FLAP\nLabeled \"bladder flap\" and received in formalin is a 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.3\ncm portion of pale tan-pink soft tissue.\nA.

The serosa is red-tan and diffusely roughened with\nhemorrhagic red-tan soft tissue adhesions. The segment of ileum and\na portion of the appendix are adhesed to the right fundic region of\nthe uterus with a large amount of hemorrhagic soft tissue adhesions\nand indurated adipose tissue. The anterior fundic region is also\ndiffusely nodular due to underlying tumor. The nodules range from.\n1.0 to 3.5 cm in greatest dimension and coalesce with one another. A\nsmall amount of parametrium is attached to the uterus and is\napproximately 2.0 cm in maximum width on the right and 1.5 cm in\nmaximum width on the left. The cervix is 3.4 x 2.8 cm in the area\nof the ectocervical region. The ectocervix is diffusely disrupted\nwith no normal cervical epithelium grossly identified. No vaginal\ncuff is grossly identified. The endocervical canal is 3.5 cm long,\nlined by velvety hyperemic mucosa. Cut section of the cervix\nreveals tan-pink, somewhat fibrotic stroma. The endometrial cavity\nis 4.2 cm long from fundus to upper endocervical canal with a\nmaximum width of 3.5 cm. The endometrium is entirely obliterated\nwith a somewhat papillated tan-pink diffusely hemorrhagic lesion\nwhich grossly extends to, and involves, the lower uterine segment.\nFocal areas of necrosis are present throughout the endometrial\nlesion. No normal endometrium is grossly identified. The uterine\nwall is 3.0 cm in maximum thickness. Cut section of the myometrium\nreveals a semi -firm pale tan appearance and is continuous with the\nendometrial tumor. The entire myometrium has a maximum thickness of\n3.0 cm and is involved by tumor. Diffuse necrosis is also present\nthroughout. The lesion grossly extends to and disrupts the serosa,\npredominantly along the posterior uterine wall. The tumor in the\nregion of the fundus also grossly invades the serosa of the segment\nof terminal ileum. The left fallopian tube is 5.5 cm long and 0.6\ncm in maximum diameter. No fimbria is grossly identified. A 1.0 x\n0.8 x 0.7 cm orange-tan nodule is present in the region of the\nfimbria. Cut section of the fallopian tube reveals a central patent\nlumen. The left ovary is red-tan, generally smooth and 2.5 x 1.5 x\n1.0 cm. Cut section of the left ovary reveals normal ovarian\nparenchyma with several white -tan scattered corpora albicantia\nidentified. No tumor is grossly identified. The segment of\nterminal ileum is 20 cm long with an average diameter of 2.5 cm.\nThe serosa of the terminal ileum is red-tan, diffusely granular with\nnumerous softtissue adhesions adhering it to the fundus of the\nuterus. Theattached mesenteric adipose tissue has a maximum width\nof 6.0 cm andis also adhesed to the posterior fundic region of the\nuterus. Thesegment of terminal ileum is opened along the\nantimesenteric border revealing pale tan, normally folded mucosa.\nCut section of the wall of the terminal ileum in the region of the\nadhesion to the fundus of the uterus reveals infiltrative tumor\nwhich grossly invades the muscularis of the terminal ileum, but does\nnot grossly invade the mucosa of the terminal ileum. The wailof\nthe terminal ileum is approximately 0.6 cm in maximum dimension.\nThe appendix is 7.0 cm long and 0.8 cm in maximum diameter. The\nattached mesoappendix has a maximum width of 1.5 cm and is diffusely\nhemorrhagic and indurated. The serosa of the appendix is red-tan\nand diffusely granular with multiple soft tissue adhesions along the\nproximal 2 cm adhering it to the fundic region of the uterus. Cut\nsection of the appendix reveals that the uterine tumor grossly\ninvolved the serosa of the appendix, but does not involve tte wall\n,fS of the appendix. A central patent 0.3 ;m maximum diameter lumen is\nidentified. The segment of cecum, including ileocecal valve, is 7.0\ncm long with a maximum diameter of 4.5 cm. The serosa of the cecum\nis red-tan with multiple red-tan hemorrhagic soft tissue adhesions.\nNo discrete areas of tumor nodules are grossly identified. The\nsegment of cecum is opened along the antimesenteric border revealing\nslightly hyperemic tan-red normally folded mucosa. The wall of the\ncecum is approximately 0.6 cm in maximum width.

The uterusmeasures 12.2 x 7.6 x 5.8 cm.\nThe cervix measures 6.2 cm long and up to 6.0 cm in diameter. The vaginal cuff along the anterior\naspect extends up to 1 .2 cm away from the cervix and along the posterior aspect extends up to 1.6 cm\naway from the cervix.. The endometrial cavity measures 3.5 cm wide and 5.7 cm long. The endometrium\nranges in thickness from 0.2 to 0.4 cm in maximum thickness. The myometrium ranges in thickness from\n1.0 to 2.8 cm in maximum thickness. The right paracervicat soft tissues extend up to 1.4 cm away from\nthe cervix and the left paracervical soft tissues extend up to 1 .6 cm away from the cervix.\nThe serosa is smooth ,glistening and red-tan. Within the cervix there is a large ,fungating ,pink-tan focally\nnecrotic mass with areas of hemorrhage present measuring 7.8 x 7.5 x 1.4 cm. The mass is fully\ncircumferential with possible involvement of the anterior and posterior lower uterine segments.The cut\nsurface of the mass reveals semiflrm pate tan tissue Intermixed mucous filled cyst that range from 0.3 to\n0.7 cm in greatest dimension .Also the mass also grossly invades greater than 50% of the cervical\nstroma and comes within 0 .2 cm of the inked serosa and 0 .7 cm of the vaginal cuff resection margin. The\nparacervical soft tissues appear grossly free of tumor .No additiona llesions are identified.\nThe remaining endometrium is focally granular with pinpoint areas of hemorrhage. The nyometrium\nconsists of soft to rubbery pink-tan tissue .Along the uterine fundus one subserosal Ieiomyoma is\nidentified measuring 0.5 cm in greatest dimension. No polyps are identified. The paracervical soft\ntissues are entirely submitted .A portion of the tumor from the 3:00 position of the cervix and normal\nendometrium from the .fun dus are released to the biorepository for possible future studies.\nRepresentative sections of remaining tissue are submitted .Gross photos are taken.\nInk key:\nBlue: Anterior\nBlack: Posterior\nSlide key:\nEl, E2.

The specimen consists of a total hysterectomy\nspecimen to include a uterus with attached cervix and attached bilateral adnexa. The left\nfallopian tube with fimbriae that is moderately hemorrhagic is 2 cm in length and up to 0.7\ncm in diameter. The ovary is tan-pink and 2 cm in greatest dimension. Bivalving reveals a\nnormal ovarian architecture as well as a 0.6 cm in greatest dimension cystic structure\ncontaining a serosanguineous fluid. The right fallopian tube is also hemorrhagic, 4 cm in\nlength and up to 0.6 cm in diameter. The ovary is tan, gray-purple, 3.5 cm in greatest\ndimension. Sectioning reveals a normal ovarian architecture as well as a few cystic\nstructures containing a serous to serosanguineous fluid ranging from 1.5 to 1.0 cm. There\nis also a paratubal cyst containing a clear fluid and smooth inner lining, 0.6 cm in greatest\ndimension.\nThe uterus cervix is 247 g, 13 x 8.5 x 5.9 cm. The serosa is tan-pink and predominantly\nsmooth. The paracervical/parametrial margin is inked black. The attached cervical cuff is 2\ncm in depth approximately 12 o'clock and 2.5 at the 6 o'clock aspect. There is a large\ncervical mass on the anterior cervix protruding through the os. Upon bivalving, the\nendocervical canal is 2.5 cm and the endometrial cavity is 3.5 cm from cornu to cornu. The\ndistance from fundus to squamocolumnar junction is approximately 7.5 cm. This cervical\nmass described above is 5.5 x 5.5 x 3.7 cm, approximately 3.2 cm from the closest vaginal\ncuff resection margin (12 o'clock). It is also well away from the endometrial cavity.\nSectioning through the cervical mass is approximately 2.5 cm in depth and well away from\nthe paracervical, parametrial, and paravaginal margins (closest 2 cm, parametrial margin).\nThe endometrium is 0.4 cm in thickness and the myometrium is 2.7 cm in thickness. The\nparenchyma is of normal uterine architecture. Sectioning the soft tissue on both the left and\nright parametrial side, the right side has a small 0.4 cm nodule and the left has a 1.2 cm in\ngreatest dimension firm nodule.

One of the portions of tissue contains a staple line. The\nspecimen is serially sectioned. RS 2\nSummary of Cassettes : 81-2, entire specimen, only the staple line\nremains in the container\nC. The specimen is designated \"radical hysterectomy (uterus,\ncervix, upper vagina)\" and consists of a 231. 4 gram uterus and cervix with\nattached bilateral adnexal structures that is 9.6 cm from fundus to\nposterior vaginal cuff margin, 4 .8 cm from cornu to cornu and 4.3 cm from\nanterior to posterior. The serosa is tan-pink and smooth. Right and left\nparametrium is present which is shaved and entirely submitted . The serosa,\ncervical resection margins and parametrium are inked as follows: anterior\nblue, posterior - black. Portions of anterior and posterior, grossly\nunremarkable vaginal cuff is present which ranges in length from 0. 8 to 2.9\ncm. The anterior vaginal cuff is tan-white, wrinkled and displays no\ndiscrete lesions . The posterior vaginal cuff is tan-white to brown and\nslightly thickened. No discrete lesions are identified on the mucosal\nsurface . The anterior ectocervical mucosa displays a 2.5 cm (width) x 1.3\ncm (length) tan-brown, endophytic, ulcerated mass that is 2.5 cm from the\nanterior vaginal cuff margin. Cut sections through the mass are tan -white,\nsmooth, have a maximum depth of 0.3 cm and are 1.5 cm from the blue-inked\nstromal margin. The posterior ectocervix contains a red-brown to\ngray-green, rubbery, exophytic massthat is 4.7 cm (width) x 2.5 cm\n(length). The mass is 2.1 cm fromthe posterior vaginal cuff margin. Cut\nsections through the mass are tan-pink to white, have a maximum depth of\n1.9 cm and are 1.1 cm from the black-inked stromal margin. The anterior\nmass is grossly confined to the ectocervix while the posterior mass extends\nto involve the endocervical mucosa. The triangular endometrial cavity is\nlined by a tan-pink to red, soft endometrium that is 0.2 cm in average\nthickness. No discrete endometrial lesions are identified. The myometrium\nis tan-pink, moderately trabeculated and contains three tan-white,\nwell-circumscribed, rubbery, whorled nodules that range from 0.4 cm in\ngreatest dimension to 0.7 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm. The nodules are located in the\nintramural aspect of the anterior and posterior myometrium. Upon\nsectioning, no areas of hemorrhage or necrosis are identified. The right\ntubo-ovarian complex is 10.5 grams. The previously interrupted fimbriated\nfallopian tube is 3.5 cm in length x 0.6 cm in diameter. The serosa is\npurple and wrinkled. Cut sections reveal a lumen. The tan-yellow to\npurple, focally cystic right ovary is 3.2 x 2.2 x 2.0 cm. The cut surfaces\nare tan-white, lobulated and contain two smooth-walled, blood-filled cysts Page 4 of 5\nthat are 0.9 x 0.7 x 0.7 cm and 1.7 x 1.4 x 1.2 cm. Both blood-filled\ncysts are consistent with hemorrhagic corpora lutea. The left tubo-ovarian\ncomplex is 9.4 grams.

The external\nsurface of the tumor is tan and roughened and focally ulcerated. The cut surface is tan,\nfirm with friable areas. Grossly, the mass appears to extend into the cervical strorna to a\nmaximum depth of 0.7 cm. The tumor appears to extend into the endocervical. canal. The\nremainder of the cervical mucosa is tan-pink, smooth and unremarkable. The endocervical\ncanal measures 3.3 cm in length and is covered by tan herring bone mucosa. The endometrial\ncavity measures 3.2 cm in length x 2.1 cm from cornu to cornu and is covered by a tan,\npredominantly flat mucosa with foci of hemorrhage. There is a 0.7 x 0.6 x 0.2 cm polypoid\nprojection from the posterior endometrial wall. The myometrium is tan, firm and\nunremarkable with a maximum thickness of 1.3 cm. The left and right fallopian tubes are\nfragmented and not patent. No fimbriated ends are identified. The left ovary is\ntan-yellow to tan-white, smooth and unremarkable. The cut surface is tan to tan--yellow to\ntan-white with multiple corpora albicantia. There is a 1.1 cm in diameter simple\nunilocular cyst in the left ovary.

The\nanterior soft tissue margin around the cervix and lower uterine segment is inked green and posterior\nblack.\nThe ectocervix has a white /tan and friable mass protruding through the os. Sectioning reveals a dilated\nendocervical canal filled with tumor. It appears similar to the ovarian tumor with copious mucinous\ndischarge. The mass measures 4.9 cm in greatest height x at least 3.5 cm in width. It involves the\nentirety of the cervix, circumferentially. No significant parametrial tissue is present. A vaginal cuff is also absent. The mass invades into but not through the cervical stroma being 0.6 cm\nfrom the inked soft tissue margin at closest approach. The mass extends up into the lower uterine\nsegment.\nThe endometrium is red/brown and shaggy appearing in multiple areas. The thickness ranges from 0.3\nto 0.7 cm. The myometrium is firm, white and trabeculated with multiple mural nodules reaching 2.8 cm\nmaximal size.

A scant amount of soft\ntan-pink-gold parametrial tissue is present along the right and left\nlateral aspects. The cervix measures 5.5 cm from right to left and 5.3\ncm from anterior to posterior. The anterior surface is inked blue and\nthe posterior surface is inked black .The annular 5.3 cm ectocervix\nranges from smooth tan-white to glistening white-pink in keeping with\ntumor. A thin rim of wrinkled tan-white vaginal mucosa circumferences\nthe ectocervical margin. The specimen is opened along the lateral\naspects to show a circumferential soft tan-white cervical tumor. A\nportion of the tumor and a portion of normal are submitted for tissue\nprocurement as requested .A frozen section is performed. On\nsectioning, the tumor has a maximal thickness of 3 cm (invasive\nthickness), however tumor replaces the entire 6.5 cm cervix. Carcinoma\nextends to within less than 0.1 cm of the inked posterior surface. The\ntriangular 4.5 x 3.2 cm uterine cavity is lined by flat tan-pink-red\nendometrium averaging 0.2 cm. The myometrium is smooth tan-pink and\nmeasures up to 2.3 cm .A single, 0 .8cm tan-white intramural leiomyoma\nis present anteriorly (see block 15). The rubbery tan-pink right and\nleft ovaries average 2 .8x 1.8 x 1.2 cm .The stroma of both ovaries is\npale tan with identifiable corpora albicantia. A few cystic structures\nmeasuring up to 0.7 cm are present within the left ovary. The\ncentrally discontinuous tan-pink right and left fallopian tubes average\n6.5 cm in length and range from 0.4-0.7 cm in diameter.

Site: The site of the tumor is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. However, it appears to be a breast cancer case based on the context.\n2. Laterality: Not provided.\n3. Histology: Infiltrating ductal carcinoma. This diagnosis is based on the initial pathology report and is inconsistent with the diagnosis provided on the Case Quality Control Form.\n4.

Behavior: The behavior of the tumor is not explicitly mentioned, but it can be inferred to be malignant based on the diagnosis of infiltrating ductal carcinoma.\n\nJustification for choice: I have chosen the diagnosis of infiltrating ductal carcinoma based on the context and the mention of \"mass formation\" and \"invasive carcinoma\" in the text. This diagnosis is inconsistent with the diagnosis provided on the Case Quality Control Form, which suggests that there may be a discrepancy between the two sources. The other categories are not provided or cannot be accurately determined based on the information given."

The laterality (left, right, or bilateral) of the tumor is not mentioned in the report.\n\nHistology: The histological diagnosis is invasive carcinoma, as indicated by the presence of desmoplastic stroma and the absence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).\n\nStage: Based on the information provided, this appears to be a pT2N1M0 stage IIB breast cancer. There is no distant metastasis (M0), but there are positive lymph nodes (N1) and a relatively large primary tumor (pT2).\n\nGrade: The grade of the tumor is not explicitly provided, but based on the description of the cells, it seems to be a high-grade carcinoma with marked nuclear atypia, increased mitotic activity, and necrosis.\n\nBehavior: This is a malignant tumor, as indicated by the invasive nature of the cancer and the presence of lymph node metastasis.

The specimen\nincludes a uterus (90.0 grams, 8.0 cm in length x 4,5 cm cornu to cornu, 3.0\ncm anterior to posterior), with a attached cervix (3.5 x 3 cm) and bilateral\nadnexa. The right fallopian tube (5.0 cm in length x 0.4 cm in\ncircumference) is attached to a right ovary (2.5 x 1.7 x 0.3 cm). The left\nfallopian tube (6.5 cm in length x 0.4 cm in circumference) is attached to a\nleft ovary (2.5 x 1.5 x 0.4 cm). Additionally, the specimen has a right\nparametrium measuring 2.5 x 0.7 x 0.5 and 3.5 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm, respectively. The vagina cuff is surrounding the cervix and measures 1.5 cm in length.\nThe serosa is tan-pink, smooth and glistening with focal areas of adhesions\nmostly at the lower posterior aspect. The anterior aspectis distorted by\nthe presence of an intramural nodule ( 2.0 x 1.8 cm ).The cervix has an\neroded surface (3.5 x 3.5 cm) with areas of hemorrhage predominantly between\n3 and 6 o'clock. Peripherally to this area the cervix is partially covered\nby a tan-pink, smooth and glistening mucosaextending into the vaginal cuff.\nThe cervical os (0.8 cm in greatest dimension) is irregular and is\nsurrounded by hemorrhagic irregular surface. The cervical canal (3.0 in\nlength x 0.8 cm circumference) has atan-pink herringbone mucosa and a focal\nareaof irregularity with papillary like projection closest to the cervical\nos which is extending into the cervical canal up to 2.0 cm. The endometrial\ncavity (3.2 x 0.5 cm) is covered by a tan-pink, hemorrhagic endometrial\nmucosa (0.1 cm in thickness). The fundic areahas a polypoid lesion (1.0 x\n0.3 x 0.2 cm). The myometrium (1.5 to 1.2 cm in thickness) is red-brown,\nwith fine tan-white fibrous septation. There is a tan-white nodular mass\nwith a whorling cut appearance in the fundic area. No other discrete lesions\nare grossly identified.\nBoth fallopian tubes have a fimbriated end and the serosa is tan-pink,\nsmooth and glistening with paratubal cysts varying in size from 0.1 to 0.3\ncm in greatest dimension and filled with a yellow clear serous fluid.\nCross sectioning demonstrates tan-pink mucosa with a pinpoint lumen. No\ndiscrete lesions are grossly identified.\nBoth ovaries have a tan-pink to tan-yellow cerebroid-like appearance of the\nexternal surface. Arising from both external surfaces, there are cystic\nlesions measuring on the right side 0.7 x 0.7 cm and on the left 0.7 x 0.5\ncm. The cysts are filled with a hemorrhagic serous fluid. Additional cystic\nlesions are grossly seen in the periphery of both ovaries varying from 0.3\nto 0.5 cm in greatest dimension.\nInk Code:\nBlueanterior aspect, surgical resection margin\nRedposterior aspect, surgical resection margin\nOrange- amputated margin (lower uterine segment and upper cervical canal)\nSection Code:\nAl-A3: right parametrium, sequentially submitted from superior to inferior,\nperpendicularly crosssectioned and entirely submitted\nA4-A6: left parametrium, sequentially submitted from superior to inferior,\nperpendicularly cross sectioned and entirely submitted\nA7-A10: vaginal cuff, submitted in a clockwise fashion, en face (A7- 12 to\n3 o'clock, A8- 3 to 6 o'clock, A9- 6 to 9 o'clock, A1O- 9 t 12 o'clock).\nA11-A14: right ovary and fallopian tube (A14 fimbriated end, entirely\nsubmitted)\nA15-A18: left ovary and left fallopian tube (A118 fimbriated end, entirely\nsubmitted)\nA19-A23: cervix, 12 to 3 o'clock\nA24-A26: cervix, 3 to 6 o'clock\nA27-A29: cervix, 6 to 9 o'clock\nA30-A33: cervix, 9 to 12 o'clock\nA34-A44: cervix upper portion adjacent to lower uterine segment,\nperpendicular crosssections from right to left (anterior aspect)\nA45-A54: cervix upper portion adjacent to lower uterine segment,\nperpendicular cross sections from right to left (posterior aspect)\nA55-A57: endometrium/myometrium, anterior aspect sequentially submitted\nfrom upper to lower portion (A57 including the most lower portion closet to\nthe cervical canal)\nI by 0\nA58:intramural leiomyoma\nA59-A61: endometrium/myometrium, posterior aspect sequentially submitted\nfrom upper to lower portion (A61 including the area closest to the cervical\ncanal).\nPart B: The specimen is received in formalin, labeled with the patient's\nname, medical record number and \"RIGHT PELVIC LYMPH NODE\" and consists of\nmultiple irregular yellow-brown fragments of fibroadipose tissue measuring\nin aggregate 5.0 x 3.5 x 1.0 cm.

The next container is additionally labeled \"left pelvic lymph nodes\" and is received fresh for frozen section diagnosis. The specimen\nconsists of a 1.3 x 1 .2 x 0.3 cm aggregate of fibroadipose tissue in\nwhich two lymph nodes are identified .Entire specimen is submitted for\nfrozen section diagnosis as D1FS .The frozen section remnant is\nsubmitted in identically labeled cassette.\nE.Thenext container is additionally labeled \"uterus , cervix,\nbilateral fallopian tubes and upper vagina and is received fresh for\nTPF. The specimen consists of a 100 gm radical hysterectomy specimen\nwhich measures 8.0 cm from fundus to cervix x 2.7 cm from anterior to\nposterior x 3.2 cm from cornua to cornua .The specimen includes an\nassociated vaginal cuff, which measures 0.8 cm on the anterior aspect of\nthe specimen and 1 .9 cm on the posterior aspect of the specimen. The\nright fallopian tube measures 6.7 x 0. 5 cm and the left fallopian tube\nmeasures 6.1 x 0.6 cm. There is associated right parametrial tissue\nwhich measures 2.7 x 2.2 x 0.7 cm and left parametrial tissue which\nmeasures 3.1 x 2 .1 x 0.8 cm. The vaginal cuff margin has been inked\nblue, and the cervical and lower uterine soft tissue resection margins\nhave been inked black.\nThe specimen is bivalved revealing a cervical mass which measures 2.9 x\n2.3 x 1.4 cm and involves approximately 80 percent of the circumference\nof the cervix. At the greatest depth of invasion , the tumor is 1.4 cm\ndeep in a cross -section that measures 2.3 cm to the nearest inked\nresection margin .The cervical mass expands and then infiltrates towards the lower uterine segment. The remainder of the endometrium is\ngolden tan in color and without additional masses or lesions. The\nmyometrium is tan-pink and exhibits a normal whorled appearance without\nidentifiable lesions. The average endometrial thickness is 0.2 cm and\nthe average myometrial thickness is 1.4 cm.\nThe right fallopian tube has a uniform caliber on cross-section, and one\npotential paratubal cyst is identified. Cross-sections of the left\nfallopian tube reveal a normal caliber throughout without identified\nmasses or lesions.\nThe external surfaces of the uterus are smooth, glistening, tan-pink in\ncolor, and intact. Dissection of the right and left parametria reveal\nno discrete masses or lesions.

The serosa is pink-tan and smooth without gross evidence of\nlesion. The vaginal cuff is measured prior to formalin fixation and measures 0.8 cm at the 12:00 position, 2.2 cm at the 6:00\nposition, 1.0 cm at the 3:00 position and 0.9 cm at the 9:00 position. The cervical os is slit like and measures 1.0 cm. There is a\n2.5 x 2.4 x 2.9 cm white-tan ill-defined rubbery mass located at the cervical os and lower uterine segment of the anterior and\nposterior uterus and appears to efface the cervix. The mass extends 2.0 cm beyond the cervical os. The right perimetrium\nmeasures 3.0 x 1.9 x 1.3 cm, the left perimetrium measures 2.8 x 2.2 x 1.1 cm. The posterior resection margin is inked black, the\nanterior resection margin is inked blue, and the circumferential vaginal cuff resection margin is inked green. The cervical os is\nprobed patent, and the uterus is bisected coronally to reveal a 2.5 x 1.2 x 0.4 cm endometrial cavity and a 3.0 x 0.6 cm\nendocervical canal. The mass invades to a depth of 1.1 cm and is 0.2 cm from the outer surface. The mass extends into the\nendocervical canal and is 0.8 cm from the vaginal cuff margin. The uterus is serially sectioned to reveal an average endometrial\nMR #: Page 2 of 3Date of Printing:\nSURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT\nNAME: SURG PATH #:\nMR #: ALT ID #:\nthickness of 0.2 cm.
