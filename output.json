GRADE = G2. \nA panel of immunohistochemical stains has been perfonned, which showed the tumor cells to be strongly positive for \nCOlO, and weakly positive for RCC and E-cadherln. Tumor cells are focally positive for cytokeratin 7 and negative for Ber\u00ad\nEP4. A colloidal iron stain was also negative. This staining pattern supports a diagnosis of conventional type renal cell \ncarcinoma. \nCASE SYNOPSIS: \nSYNOPTIC DATA -PRIMARY KIDNEY TUMORS \nSPECIMEN TYPE: Radical nephrectomy \nLATERALITY: Right \nTUMOR SITE: Middle \nFOCALlTY: Unifocal \nTUMOR SIZE: Greatest dimension: 4.0 cm \nAdditional dimensions: 3.5 cm \nMACROSCOPIC EXTENT OF TUMOR: Tumor limited to kidney \nHISTOLOGIC TYPE: Clear cell (conventional) renal carcinoma \nHISTOLOGIC GRADE (Fuhrman Nuclear Grade): G2 \nPATHOLOGIC STAGING (pTNM): pT1a \npNX \nNumber of regional lymph nodes examined: 0 \npMX \nMARGINS: Margins uninvolved by invasive carcinoma \nADRENAL GLAND: Uninvolved by tumor \nVENOUS (LARGE VESSEL) INVASION (V): Absent \nLYMPHATIC (SMALL VESSEL) INVASION (L): Absent \nADDITIONAL PATHOLOGIC FINDINGS: Glomerular disease (type): Minimal global glomerusclerosis ",
        "llm_output": " 1. \"Site\": Right kidney. Justified as the report clearly mentions the tumor is located in the right kidney.\n2. \"Laterality\": Right. As mentioned above, the tumor is located in the right kidney.\n3. \"Histology\": Renal cell carcinoma, conventional (clear) cell type. This is specified in the report as the final diagnosis.\n4. \"Stage\": pT1a NX MX. The tumor is confined within the renal capsule and does not invade the renal vein or any lymphatic vessels. The report also mentions no regional lymph nodes were examined.\n5. \"Grade\": Grade II (Intermediate grade or moderately differentiated). The report states the Fuhrman's nuclear grade is 2 of 4, which corresponds to Grade II.\n6. \"Behavior\": Malignant. This is inherent in the diagnosis of carcinoma."
