REVIEWED BY: INTRAOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
FSA:Uterus: Extensive necrotic tumor, uterus and cervix. Gross
examination only. (M)
CLINICAL INFORMATION: stage 1 B2 adenosquamous
carcinoma of the cervix.
GROSS DESCRIPTION: Number of specimen containers: five, each labeled with
patient name and MRN
M.
A.Container designation: ""uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries""
--Received unfixed is a radical hysterectomy specimen consisting of
uterus, cervix, attached bilateral adnexa and parametrial tissue weighing
260 gm, measuring 13.5 x 6.5 x 6.0 cm. The anterior serosa is smooth, the
posterior serosa demonstrates a firm subserosal yellow-gray mass in the
body measuring 4.5 x 2.9 x 1.0 cm. Surfacing the serosa and the mass is a
1.0 x 0.8 x 0.6 cm cystic structure occupied by clear watery fluid. The
posterior serosa and soft tissue margins are inked. The ectocervix is
pink-tan with purpuric changes surrounding the os 1.0 cm (tumor?) and an
anterior/posterior vaginal identified 1.0 and 0.8 cm in Length,
respectively. Sectioning of the anterior cervix at the os is grossly
unremarkable, however, the tumor extends from within 0.9 cm of the
anterior cervical os to the fundus and appears full thickness in the lower
uterine segment and body. The posterior aspect is similar in appearance
to that of the anterior aspect. Sectioning of the tumor demonstrates a
yellow-gray purulent appearance with prominent necrosis. Representative
sections of tumor and normal are submitted to
n. The right ovary
measures 2.2 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm and sectioning demonstrates a thickened cortex
and pink-tan mottled stroma. The pink-tan fallopian tube with fimbriated
end measures 5.5 cm in length, 0.6 cm in external diameter and sectioning
demonstrates a pink-tan mottled stroma. The left ovary measures 3.0 x 1.5
x 1.0 cm and sectioning demonstrates a pink-tan mottled stroma. The
corresponding pink-tan fallopian tube with fimbriated end measures 6.0 cm
in length, 0.5 cm in external diameter and sectioning demonstrates a
pinpoint lumen. Sections are submitted as follows: cassette Al-posterior
body, serosa with nodule extruding; cassette A2-representative
anterior/posterior vaginal cuff (anterior inked red, posterior green); A3- anterior cervix and ectocervix full thickness; cassette A4-anterior
endocervical canal full thickness; cassette A5-posterior cervix full
thickness with ectocervix; cassette A6-posterior endocervical canal;
cassette A7-anterior body; cassette
A8-posterior body full thickness; cassette A9-anterior fundus full

multiple portions of fat aggregating to 3.5 x 3 x 1.5 cm. Five possible
lymph nodes are identified upon sectioning, the largest measuring 1.7 cm.
The lymph nodes are entirely submitted as follows: B'- '-BS-one bisected
lymph node in each.
C.Container designation: ""Left pelvic lymph node"" - Received are
multiple portions of fat aggregating to 4 x 3 x 1 cm. Eight possible
lymph nodes are identified upon sectioning, the largest measuring 1.5 cm.
The lymph nodes are entirely submitted as follows: Cl-four lymph nodes in
toto, C2-C4-one bisected lymph node in each, C5-four possible lymph nodes
in toto.
D.Container designation: ""Right periaortic lymph node"" - Received are
three lymph nodes, the largest measuring 2 x 0.7 x 0.2 cm. The lymph
nodes are entirely submitted from Dl to D3, each containing one bisected
lymph node.
E.Container designation: ""Sigmoid adhesion"" - Received is a portion of
gray-tan membranous tissue measuring 2 x 0.6 x 0.1 cm, bisected and
entirely submitted in El.

Justification: The tumor was found in the cervix, as indicated by the report.

Laterality: Left
Justification: The left perimetrium (outer part of the uterus) had metastatic squamous cell carcinoma, indicating that the primary tumor was located on the same side.

Histology: Squamous cell carcinoma
Justification: The report specifically mentions squamous cell carcinoma as the type of cancer present.

Stage: FIGO Stage IIB (LIB)
Justification: According to the FIGO staging system for cervical cancer, stage IIB indicates that the tumor has extended beyond the cervix but not to the pelvic wall or lower third of the vagina. The report mentions that the tumor extends from 3 o'clock to 9 o'clock and involves the posterior cervix, which supports this staging.

Grade: Poorly differentiated (High grade squamous intraepithelial lesion)
Justification: The report describes the tumor as poorly differentiated and having high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, indicating a high-grade cancer.

Behavior: Malignant
Justification: The report indicates that the patient was diagnosed with cervical cancer, which is by definition a malignant neoplasm.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Microscopic Description and Comment
Histologic section of the cervical biopsy shows a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma. The predominant pattern of this
tumor is villoglandular papillary adenocarcinoma with fibrovascular cores of variable lengths lined by neoplastic
epithelium that exhibits predominantly intestinal-type differentiation. Dispersed throughout the villoglandular
adenocarcinoma are areas showing complex cribriform architecture. These cribriform areas represent about 10-15%
of lesional tissue . Although stromal invasion is not definitively identified, there is essentially no normal stroma present
within the biopsy tissue to exclude an invasive component. Dr.has reviewed this case and concurs.

W.D. / 4 M.D.
Microscopic Description and Comment:
Sections of the cervix show a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma of endometrioid type with focal squamous
differentiation. Only rare foci of lymphovascular invasion are noted. The maximum depth of tumor invasion in the cervix
is 0.5 cm out of a cervical wall thickness of 1.2 cm. The tumor also extends into the lower uterine segment where the
maximum depth of tumor invasion, seen in the anterior half, measures 0.9 cm out of a total myometrial thickness of 1.2
cm. Even though there is extension of tumor into the lower uterine segment, thg fact that the bulk of the tumor is within
the endocervix is consistent with a cervical rather than an endometrial origin.

f ^yt; COMMENT
The ""uterine curettings ""consists of fragments of
endometrium and endocervix admixed with fragments of a
well-differentiated adenocarcinoma . The endometria•1 fragments
show the effects of progestogen administration ;the g land sare
small, sparse, and lined by a layer of simple columnar epithelium.
A few glandular mitoses are presen t
strcna.eglandsa^;dCtvc^1110yrudimentary secretory changes.
pseudodecidualized with. a focal stronial chron ic in.Elaiuuatory
infiltrate and ectatic blood vessels . Focally, there is gland and
sttgmal reakdown. The separ .ate_..fra •gments of adenocarc i.noma are
well -diffferentia^ed .The lesion exhibits both glandula rand
villous /papillary architecture .The tumor cells exhibit prominent
intracyto plasmic mucin as well as abundant extracellular mucin
production. Multiple fragments of endocervix with focal squamous
metaplasia are admixed . One, ,of these small endocervical fragments
is partially replaced by markedly atypical glandular eplthel,iu.rn'
suggestive of adenocarcinoma in situ. There is one tiny clump of
fl dysplastic squamous epithelium' Th subsequently performed.c. shows a fragment 01:cervical biopsy from 3 o'clock
adenocarcinoma with histologic and cytologic features identical to
those noted above .The cervical biopsy from 12 o'clock performed
at the sametitne shows mild c7,ysplasia (CIN J), chronic
inflammation and marked hyperkeratosis .The left ovarian cyst
is a corpus luteum cyst ,and there are a few surface
fibrous adhesions on the ovary.
While there is no completely reliable way of assigning origin
( endocervix /endometrium) to a mucinous lesion of this type on thu
basis of its,h'astologic apearance alone, this patient's young age,
lack of associated endometrial hyperplasia, and suggestion of
adenocarcinoma in situ would all favor an endocervical o) i.g.1n for
this lesion. Surg. Path. No.:

Microscopic Description and Comment
Histologic sections from both superior and inferior cervical biopsies show invasive adenocarcinoma, moderately
differentiated.The morphologic features are distorted in much of these specimens by extensive cautery effect. Where
relatively well preserved, the tumor invades as large nests of moderately pleomorphic cells with abundant mucinous
cytoplasm and a high mitotic rate. This tumor is best classified as mucinous adenocarcinoma of endocervical type,
although many of the cells have signet ring features and there are small foci of endometrioid differentiation as well.
Tumor is present on virtually every section from these large biopsies and is present at multiple inked and cauterized
margins. Detached fragments of adenocarcinoma are present in the endocervical canal biopsy.
History
The patient is a year old woman with cervical cancer.

Suctions of the cervical biopsy show Invasive squamous cell carcinoma. The invading cells am arranged in smog nets
and show large nuclei ,pale-staining chromatin, and nudeoti. intercellular bridged am seen among some of the cells.
Mitotic activity is frequent The Invasive tumor Is found beneath unr emarkable squamous epithetlum .One piece of thebiopsy shows foca lkollocytio atypia and mild dysplesle (CINI) invojving the surface, however Is not connected to the
squamous carcinoma.
Sections of the endocervical curettage material show .In addition to benign endocervicel tissue, small ,detachedfragments of dysptastic squamous epithelium .Because the fragments are small. poorly-oriented ,and not associatedwith stme ,it is impossible to grade the dysplesia.

The cervical cone biopsy contains extensive ,invasive ,focally keratinizing ,moderateI1dlfl reMated squamous cell
carcinoma involving all eight blocks of tissue .The tumor extensively involves one latoraln arginwid the deep margin.
The tumor measures 1.4 cm in greatest lateral dimension and 0 .9 cm In depth ,as mi asured fror>o histologic sections,

however, the tumor may be larger than this given that the resection margins are positive. Lymphvascular space
invasion is Identified. The surface epithelicxn aclacent to invasive cancer shows severe dysplasia (CIN 3). The
specimen labeled posterior cul-de-sac biopsy contains a very small fragment of invasive squamous cell carcinoma. The
iandocervical curettage specimen also contains fragments of invasive squamous cell carcinoma.
liisidlogic.sections from the right ovarian biopsy show two fragments of tissue. One contains what appears to be
'ovatian* cc rtex but which lacks any follicles. A small amount of smooth muscle Is present as well as some apparent
over ail surface epithelium. This may represent a portion of cortex adhesed to adnexal soft tissue. The other fragment
shows fibrous connective tissue with benign appearing squamous epithelium. I cannot confirm that this piece of tissue
originates from the ovary. The specimen labeled ""left adnexal biopsyt Is composed of inflamed connective tissue with
smooth muscle and serosai. No definitive ovarian tissue or follicle formation is present. No malignancy is Identified in
either of these ovarian specimens.
Histo :The patient is year old woman with pain and bleeding.

Laterality: Not provided
Histology: Keratinizing subtype squamous cell (epidermoid) carcinoma, invasive type
Stage: IS (Insufficient data to assign stage)
Grade: Nuclear grade 2 (Moderate differentiated)
Behavior: Malignant neoplasm present, involves lower segment of the uterus and vagina, widespread lymphatic invasion by tumor.

Justification: The maximum depth of tumor invasion is 15 mm, and the breadth of the tumor is 37 mm. Two out of 19 regional lymph nodes are metastatically involved, but extracapsular extension of metastatic tumor through the lymph node capsule is absent. The status of distant metastases cannot be assessed due to insufficient data. Invasive tumor is present in the separately submitted specimen of ""left vaginal margin,"" indicating that the extent of vaginal involvement cannot be determined from pathologic information. Therefore, the final stage of the tumor is IS (Insufficient data to assign stage).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DIAGNOSIS:
1:UTERUS AND VAGINAL CUFF, RADICAL HYSTERECTOMY:
-Invasive, poorly differentiated s amour cell carcinoma of
cervix, mike non- eratinizing and keratinizing types (see
comment)
-Involvement of cervix by carcinoma is circumferential
-Tumor measures about 3.5 cm in diameter, about 2 cm in
maximum thickness and involves about a 3.5 cm long segment of
tissue extending from the lower uterine segment to the
vaginal cuff
-Invasion of the cervical wall by tumor is transmural
-A 2.5 x 1.0 cm transmural cervical wall defect involving the
anterior endocervix is present
-Tumor invades paracervical soft tissues (so-called
paracervical parametrium) and focally extends to the
margin of the paracervical soft tissues
-Lymphatic invasion by tumor is present within lower uterine
segment, cervix, vaginal cuff, and paracervical soft tissues
-Vascular (arterial and venous) invasion by tumor is present
in cervix
-Tumor invades the wall of the upper vagina (vaginal cuff)
anteriorly and posteriorly
-Invasive carcinoma is present less than 0.5 mm from the
inked deep margin of the wall of the anterior vaginal cuff,
about 2 mm from the inferior surgical margin of the
anterior vaginal cuff, and within less than 5 mm of the
posterior vaginal cuff
-Involvement of the wall of the lower uterine segment by tumor
is nearly transmural, anteriorly
-Involvement of the posterior wall of the lower uterine
segment is about 50% of the thickness
-Uterine corpus and fundus are negative for carcinoma
-Mucosal surface of the tumor is extensively ulcerated
-Endocervical canal is obstructed by tumor (near total
stenosis)
-Acute and chronic inflammatory reaction and fibrosing stromal
reaction to invasive carcinoma are present
-Tumor associated necrosis is present
-Other findings include:
-Benign non-phasic endometrium (non-functional basalis
endometrium, weakly proliferative endometrium, and some
endometrium showing secretory glandular changes)
-Uterine leiomyoma
-Subserosal mullerianosis (endosalpingiosis), posterior
lower uterine segment

COMMENT:The non-keratinizing component of the tumor predominates.
No intracytoplasmic mucin is detected within the neoplastic cells
on mucicarmine stains.Elastin and trichrome stainswereused to
further investigate the blood vessel invasion by tumor. The
transmural defect in the uterine wall may have been produced by a
combination of factors including transmural wall involvement by
invasive carcinoma, tumor perforation, and technical difficulties in
removing the specimens due to adhesions to surrounding structures.

1:UTERUS AND CERVIX
Labeled ""uterus and cervix"", received fresh in the Operating Room and
subsequently fixed in formalin, is a 100 gram radical hysterectomy
specimenwith an attached 1.5 to 2.5 cm long cuff of superior vaginal
tissue and paracervical/paracorporal parametrial soft tissues,
measuring up to about 1.8 cm in width. The uterusmeasures about 8
cm from the fundus to the ectocervix, 5 cm from cornu to cornu, and
a maximumof 5 cm from the anterior to the posterior surface.
External examination of thespecimen is remarkable for a 2.5 x 1.0 cm
transmural defect with an irregular shaggy border involving the
anterior endocervix. The margins of the tissues bordering the
defect are inked blue.The rest of the serosal surface of the
uterus is tan-pink, intact, and relatively smooth. The paracervical
soft tissuesare focally involved by tumor. The margin of the
of the vaginal cuff is painted with black ink. The cervix is
virtually replaced by an exophytic and endophytic tumor that focally
protrudes through the external os. The tumor is circumferential,
about 3.5 cm in diameter, and involves about a 3.5 cm long segment
of tissue extending from the lower uterine segment into the wall
of the upper vagina. The mucosal aspect of the tumor is amber-
tan to reddish-tan and ulcerated. The endocervical canal shows
subtotal stenosiswith obstruction due to occupation by tumor.On
cut sections, the tumor involves the entire wall of the cervix and
has a maximum thickness of about 2.0 cm. Invasion of the wall of
the anterior lower uterine segment by tumor is also nearly full
thickness.Invasion of the wall of the posterior lower uterine
segment is less.The tumor invades the wall of the upper vagina.
Involvement of the vaginal wall is nearly full thickness. Tumor
within the wall of the vagina extends very close to the vaginal cuff
margin, inferiorly.The overlying vaginal mucosa is tan-pink and
appears grossly uninvolved by tumor. Little, grossly uninvolved
tan, intact squamous epithelium is grossly evident in the cervix.
As stated above, the endocervix is virtually replaced by tumor. The
endometrial cavity is about 4 cm in length and has a maximum width
of about 2.5 cm. The endometrium lining the uterine corpus and
fundus is tan, smooth and has a maximum thickness of about 0.1 cm.
The uterine wall measures about 2.2 cm in maximum thickness. Cut
https:/, Page 3 of
sections of the uterus are remarkable for a 1.5 cm diameter,
circumscribed leiomyoma with a typical firm, white, whorled cut
surface involving the upper posterior uterine wall near the fundus.

MICROSCOPIC EXAM:
Sections of the cervical tumor show nests of malignant
cells. The nests appear to be infiltrating cervical glands
and there are bands of collagen surrounding many of the
nests. The malignant cells are somewhat radially located
around the edges of the nests. Central necrosis within the
https:/ •'.. -Clinical Document: I Page 2 of 3
nests is prominent. The tumor cells have a high nuclear to
cytoplasmic ratio with nuclei containing loose chromatin and
small nucleoli. Mitotic figures are abundant.
GROSS DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received fresh in five containers bearing
the patient' s name and hospital number.
Part #1, labeled ""uterus and cervix,"" consists of a 1128-gm
uterus and cervix with no attached adnexa. The uterus
measures 14.5 cm from cornu to cornu, 17 cm from cervical os
to top of fundus, and 9 cm from anterior to posterior. A
probe extends into the cervical os 14.5. The cervix is
round with a defect in the posterior 6 o'clock position.
The defect appears to be within a lesion that is 3.5 cm from
lateral to lateral and is 2 cm from anterior to posterior
and involves the entire posterior aspect of the cervix. The
defect appears as a chunk out of this lesion that is 1.5 cm
deep and 1.5 cm on its side. The cervix itself is 5 cm from
lateral to lateral and 4 cm anterior to posterior. There is
2 cm of attached vaginal wall that is attached from the 6
o'clock to the 9 o'clock position. On the anterior and left
side there is approximately 1 cm of attached vaginal wall.
The serosa on the uterus is pink and unremarkable. The left
parametrium is inked with black ink and the right
parametrium is inked with green ink. Upon opening the
uterus, the cervical canal measures 3.5 cm and the
endometrial cavity is 10.5 cm vertically and 7 cm at its
widest point. The endometrial cavity is covered with a
boggy, hemorrhagic-appearing endometrium. The myometrium is
thick and boggy-appearing. The maximum thickness is 3.5 cm.
The cervix is dissected away from the specimen and entirely
submitted as follows:
Al-A6 12 o'clock to 3 o'clock
A7-A13 3o'clock to 6 o'clock
A14-A24 6o'clock to 9 o'clock
A25-A30 9 o'clock to 12 o'clock
A31-A36 right parametrium
A37-A39 left parametrium
A40-A47 uterus
Part #2, labeled ""right pelvic lymph node,"" consists of two
fragments of fibroadipose tissue. The first piece is 1.5 x
1x 0.7 cm and the second is 2.1 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm. The
specimen is entirely submitted in cassettes B1 and B2.
Part #3, labeled ""right periaortic,"" consists of one lymph
node that is 2 x 1.2 x 0.8 cm and another small piece of
fibroadipose tissue that is 1 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm. The specimen
is entirely submitted in cassettes C1.
Part #4, labeled ""left pelvic lymph node,"" consists of a
fragment of fibroadipose tissue that is 2.5 x 0.7 x 1.2 cm.
The specimen is bisected and entirely submitted in cassettes
D1 and D2.
Part #5, labeled ""left periaortic lymph nodes,"" consists of
one piece of fibroadipose tissue that is 1.1 x 0.9 x 0.5 cm.
The specimen is entirely submitted in cassette El.

inflammation
COMMENT: The invasive carcinoma exhibits predominantly features
of non-keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma. A few of the nests of
tumor cells have lumen-like spaces (? true lumens versus artifacts
related to tumor cell necrosis). No mucicarminophilic mucin is
detected in the neoplastic cells and only very rare tumor cells
contain PAS-positive, diastase-resistant mucin and/or Alcian blue
PAS-positive material. Sections of the parametrial and right and
left pelvic lymph nodes were stained for keratin using AE1/AE3
antibody. The metastatic tumor cells are highlighted in the
affected lymph nodes, including a few ""occult"" metastatic tumor
cells in subcapsular sinus of the affected left parametrial lymph
node.

COMMENT: Gross and microscopic eva_uation of -_re hysterectomy
specimen demonstrates diffuse involvement (and replacement) of
mucosal surfaces (endocervical, lower uterine segment and
endometrial), cervical stromal tissues and myometrium by squamous
cell carcinoma. Sections from the transition zone of the cervix
demonstrate previous biopsy site changes in addition to mu tfocal
areas of squamous cell carcinoma in situ. These changes are also
seen in most sections from the lower uterine segment and
endometrium. Invasive squamous cell carcinoma erodes through the
cervical stroma and is present at the paracervical soft tissue
margins of resection, as well as adjacent to the distal
(paravaginal) margins of resection (considered positive margins. The
myometrium is diffusely involved by invasive squamous cell
carcinoma, with extension to the serosal surfaces. In the right
fundic region, carcinoma invades into the serosal surfaces of the
terminal ileum and appendix with extension through the muscularis
propria and towards the mucosal surfaces. The right oophorectomy
specimen demonstrates invasive squamous cell carcinoma (similar to
that seen elsewhere), secondarily involving a pre-existing
cystadenofibroma. The possibility of direct spread of the carcinoma
from the uterus to the right ovary cannot be excluded (versus
metastatic spread or ""co-synchronous primary"". The tumor appears
high grade with significant tumor-associated necrosis,
angiolymphatic vascular space invasion and a high rate of mitotic
activity.

2: RIGHT OVARY AND FROZEN SECTION
Labeled ""right ovary and FS"", received fresh in the Operating Room
and subsequently fixed in formalin, is a 6.0 x 5.5 x 4.5 cm
cystically dilated ovary. The surface of the ovary is tan-pink with
numerous red-tarr, hemorrhagic soft tissue adhesions and a 2.5 x 2.0 cm
defect which exposes a pale tan friable tumor. Cut section of the
ovary reveals a 2.5 x 2.4 cm solid pale tan papillated nodular lesion
in the lining of the ovary with adjacent. attached 1.5 x 1.2 x 1.0 cm
cyst. The cyst is fili<rtd with cloudy pale yellow fluid. Cut section
of the papillated solid area corresponds to a 4.0 x 4.0 x 3.5 cm
semi-firm tan-yellow mass which extends to the previously described
defect. Focal areas of hemorrhage and necrosis are present
throughout the mass. The remaining lining of the cyst is generally
smooth and glistening, pale tan-pink with prominent small vessels and
no other discrete vessels or solid areas grossly identified. The
uninvolved cyst lining is approximately 0.2 cm in average thickness.
No normal ovarian parenchyma is grossly identified. Representative

3: UTERUS WITH ILEUM AND CECUM
Labeled ""uterus with ileum and cecum"", received fresh in the
Operating Room and subsequently fixed in formalin, is a 340 gram
total abdominal hysterectomy with attached left fallopian tube and
ovary, ileum, cecum, and appendix. :tie uterus is 10.0 cm from fundus
to cervix, 6.5 cm from cornu to cornu, and 5.5 cm from anterior to
posterior. The serosa is red-tan and diffusely roughened with
hemorrhagic red-tan soft tissue adhesions. The segment of ileum and
a portion of the appendix are adhesed to the right fundic region of
the uterus with a large amount of hemorrhagic soft tissue adhesions
and indurated adipose tissue. The anterior fundic region is also
diffusely nodular due to underlying tumor. The nodules range from.
1.0 to 3.5 cm in greatest dimension and coalesce with one another. A
small amount of parametrium is attached to the uterus and is
approximately 2.0 cm in maximum width on the right and 1.5 cm in
maximum width on the left. The cervix is 3.4 x 2.8 cm in the area
of the ectocervical region. The ectocervix is diffusely disrupted
with no normal cervical epithelium grossly identified. No vaginal
cuff is grossly identified. The endocervical canal is 3.5 cm long,
lined by velvety hyperemic mucosa. Cut section of the cervix
reveals tan-pink, somewhat fibrotic stroma. The endometrial cavity
is 4.2 cm long from fundus to upper endocervical canal with a
maximum width of 3.5 cm. The endometrium is entirely obliterated
with a somewhat papillated tan-pink diffusely hemorrhagic lesion
which grossly extends to, and involves, the lower uterine segment.
Focal areas of necrosis are present throughout the endometrial
lesion. No normal endometrium is grossly identified. The uterine
wall is 3.0 cm in maximum thickness. Cut section of the myometrium
reveals a semi -firm pale tan appearance and is continuous with the
endometrial tumor. The entire myometrium has a maximum thickness of
3.0 cm and is involved by tumor. Diffuse necrosis is also present
throughout. The lesion grossly extends to and disrupts the serosa,
predominantly along the posterior uterine wall. The tumor in the
region of the fundus also grossly invades the serosa of the segment
of terminal ileum. The left fallopian tube is 5.5 cm long and 0.6
cm in maximum diameter. No fimbria is grossly identified. A 1.0 x
0.8 x 0.7 cm orange-tan nodule is present in the region of the
fimbria. Cut section of the fallopian tube reveals a central patent
lumen. The left ovary is red-tan, generally smooth and 2.5 x 1.5 x
1.0 cm. Cut section of the left ovary reveals normal ovarian
parenchyma with several white -tan scattered corpora albicantia
identified. No tumor is grossly identified. The segment of
terminal ileum is 20 cm long with an average diameter of 2.5 cm.
The serosa of the terminal ileum is red-tan, diffusely granular with
numerous softtissue adhesions adhering it to the fundus of the
uterus. Theattached mesenteric adipose tissue has a maximum width
of 6.0 cm andis also adhesed to the posterior fundic region of the
uterus. Thesegment of terminal ileum is opened along the
antimesenteric border revealing pale tan, normally folded mucosa.
Cut section of the wall of the terminal ileum in the region of the
adhesion to the fundus of the uterus reveals infiltrative tumor
which grossly invades the muscularis of the terminal ileum, but does
not grossly invade the mucosa of the terminal ileum. The wailof
the terminal ileum is approximately 0.6 cm in maximum dimension.
The appendix is 7.0 cm long and 0.8 cm in maximum diameter. The
attached mesoappendix has a maximum width of 1.5 cm and is diffusely
hemorrhagic and indurated. The serosa of the appendix is red-tan
and diffusely granular with multiple soft tissue adhesions along the
proximal 2 cm adhering it to the fundic region of the uterus. Cut
section of the appendix reveals that the uterine tumor grossly
involved the serosa of the appendix, but does not involve tte wall
,fS of the appendix. A central patent 0.3 ;m maximum diameter lumen is
identified. The segment of cecum, including ileocecal valve, is 7.0
cm long with a maximum diameter of 4.5 cm. The serosa of the cecum
is red-tan with multiple red-tan hemorrhagic soft tissue adhesions.
No discrete areas of tumor nodules are grossly identified. The
segment of cecum is opened along the antimesenteric border revealing
slightly hyperemic tan-red normally folded mucosa. The wall of the
cecum is approximately 0.6 cm in maximum width. The cecum and
ileocecal valve appear grossly free of tumor. Dissection of the
pericolonic and adipose tissue reveals several tan-pink lymph nodes
ranging from 0.2 to 0.7 cm. Representative sections are submitted.

Labeled with the patient's name,designated ""uterus, cervix"", and received in
formalin is a 529.5 gram hysterectomy specimen. No attached adnexal structures are present. The
uterus is approximately 14.0 x 9.5 x 7.5 cm. The cervical portion of the uterus is approximately 4.6 cm in
diameter, 3.5 cm in length between the two of them. The cervical os measures 1.5 cm in diameter. The
posterior vaginal cuff measures 4.5 cm x 1.1 x 0.2 cm. The endometrium is 5.0 cm long and 1.0 cm in
width and less than 0,1 cm throughout in thickness. The myometrial wall ranges in size from 1.5 to 3.0
cm in thickness.
The uterus is markedly distorted in shape due to the presence of a mass in the cervix and a large anterior
leiomyoma. The cervical mass is 6.8 x 5 .5 x 4.5 cm in greatest dimension and is friable ,diffusely necrotic
with areas of hemorrhage and with a well-circumscribed but infiltrative border. The cervical mass comes
within 0.3 cm of the anterior inked surface and less than 0.1 cm of the posterior inked surface. Superiorly
the cervical mass does not appear to be grossly invasive or extend beyond the lower uterine segment.
The anterior leiomyoma measures 8.5 x 7.5 x 7.5 cm and is composed of solid white-tan tissue with a
whorled appearance. Additionally there are multiple (about ten) intramural leiomyomas ranging in size
from 0.4 to 8.0 cm, one of which is subserosal .The myometrium is also suspicious for adenomyosis. No
other endometrial lesions are identified.

E. UTERUS. CERVIXandLabeled designated ""uterus ,cervix "",and received fresh and subsequently pinned
fixed in formalin is a 248 gram, intact hysterectomy specimen. The uterusmeasures 12.2 x 7.6 x 5.8 cm.
The cervix measures 6.2 cm long and up to 6.0 cm in diameter. The vaginal cuff along the anterior
aspect extends up to 1 .2 cm away from the cervix and along the posterior aspect extends up to 1.6 cm
away from the cervix.. The endometrial cavity measures 3.5 cm wide and 5.7 cm long. The endometrium
ranges in thickness from 0.2 to 0.4 cm in maximum thickness. The myometrium ranges in thickness from
1.0 to 2.8 cm in maximum thickness. The right paracervicat soft tissues extend up to 1.4 cm away from
the cervix and the left paracervical soft tissues extend up to 1 .6 cm away from the cervix.
The serosa is smooth ,glistening and red-tan. Within the cervix there is a large ,fungating ,pink-tan focally
necrotic mass with areas of hemorrhage present measuring 7.8 x 7.5 x 1.4 cm. The mass is fully
circumferential with possible involvement of the anterior and posterior lower uterine segments.The cut
surface of the mass reveals semiflrm pate tan tissue Intermixed mucous filled cyst that range from 0.3 to
0.7 cm in greatest dimension .Also the mass also grossly invades greater than 50% of the cervical
stroma and comes within 0 .2 cm of the inked serosa and 0 .7 cm of the vaginal cuff resection margin. The
paracervical soft tissues appear grossly free of tumor .No additiona llesions are identified.
The remaining endometrium is focally granular with pinpoint areas of hemorrhage. The nyometrium
consists of soft to rubbery pink-tan tissue .Along the uterine fundus one subserosal Ieiomyoma is
identified measuring 0.5 cm in greatest dimension. No polyps are identified. The paracervical soft
tissues are entirely submitted .A portion of the tumor from the 3:00 position of the cervix and normal
endometrium from the .fun dus are released to the biorepository for possible future studies.

Reviewer InitialsDate Reviewed:"," Site: Uterus, Cervix
Laterality: Not provided
Histology: A large fungating mass in the cervix suggestive of malignancy
Stage: Not determined from this report
Grade: Not provided
Behavior: Malignant, as indicated by the size and extent of the tumor in the cervix and its invasion into the myometrium and serosa.

Justification: The presence of a large fungating mass with necrosis and hemorrhage in the cervix, along with its gross invasion into the myometrium and coming close to the serosa, suggests a malignant process. However, the specific type, stage, and grade of the tumor are not provided in this report.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
