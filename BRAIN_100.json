Right insular tumor: astrocytoma with mitotic activity. see \ncomment. \nComment:  TCGA-CS-4942 \nThe tumor in specimens #1 and #2 contains fibrillary astrocytoma \ncomposed of moderately pleomorphic fibrillary astrocytes. Rare but \nmultiple mitoses are present in both specimens #1 and #2. Two mitotic \nf; \u00b71res are identified in specimen #1 (slide 18) and two mitotic \ntol:1ures are identified in specimen #2 (slide 28). The proliferation \nindex as determined by Ki67 (MI8-1) staining is greater than 5% in \nsmall foci of specimen #2 (slide 2A). The identification of rare \nmitoses and a focally elevated proliferation index suggest that this \nastrocytic tumor is an astrocytoma (WHO grade II) in the process of \ntransformation to a higher grade tumor or that these tumor biopsies are \nfrom a higher grade tumor.

Epidermal growth factor receptor variant \nIII \n(EGFRvIII) is an oncogenic, constitutively active mutant form of EGFR \nthat is \ncommonly expressed in glioblastoma. Cell culture and in vivo models of \nglioblastoma have demonstrated EGFRvIII as defining prognostically \ndistinct \nsub~roups of \u00b7\"glioblastomas. Additionally I the presence of EGFRvIII has \nbeen \nshown to sensitize tumors to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors when the \ntumor \nsuppressor protein PTEN is intact. RNA is extracted from formalin \nfixed, \nparaffin embedded tissue samples and reverse transcribed to cDNA. The \ncDNA is \nthen amplified using standard PCR technique for DNA templates.

All markers are microsatellites \n(2 or 4 \nnt repeats) except PLA2G4C which is a minisatellite (26 nt repeat) \npolymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score, \namplicon size, and ease of interpretation.

Though in many areas the\ncells assume an oligodendroglial profile, in other areas more pleomorphic\nelements with astrocytic appearance are present.

Cells with no signals or with signals of\nonly one color are disregarded. References ranges for our laboratory for\nallelic loss versus no allelic loss were established by evaluating both\nprobe sets in a series of 40 normal cases from 10 different organs.

The 3 \nmarkers \non Ip are D1S548, D1S1592, and D1S552 (with D1S468, D1S1612, and \nD1S496 as \nbackup markers) and the 3 markers on 19q are D19S219, D19S412, and \nPLA2G4C \n(with D19S606 and D19S1182 as backup). All markers are microsatellites \n(2 or 4 \nnt repeats) except PLA2G4C which is a minisatellite (26 nt repeat) \npolymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score, \namplicon size, and ease of interpretation. The backup markers are used \nif the \nfirst line markers at that chromosome arm are uninformative or \notherwise \nambiguous in their interpretation. LOR at all informative loci on each \nchromosomal arm represents the typical finding in oligodendrogliomas \nwith Ip \nand 19q deletion. \nFDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results \nfrom a \nstand-alone diagnostic test.

Epidermal growth factor receptor variant\nIII\n(EGFRvIII) is an oncogenic, constitutively active mutant form of EGFR that is commonly expressed in\nglioblastoma. Cell culture and in vivo models of glioblastoma have demonstrated EGFRvIII as defining prognostically\ndistinct\nsubgroups of glioblastomas .Additionally ,the presence of EGFRvIII has been shown to sensitize tumors\nto EGFR\ntyrosine kinase inhibitors when the tumor suppressor protein PTEN is intact. RNA is extracted from\nformalin fixed,\nparaffin embedded tissue samples and reverse transcribed to cDNA. The cDNA is then amplified using\nstandard PCR\ntechnique for DNA templates. PCR products are detected by gel electrophoresis. The limit of detection of\nthis assay\nhas been determined to be approximately 5 mutant cells in 100 normal cells.\nFDA Comment :The above data are not to be construed as the results from a stand alone diagnostic test.\nThis test\nwas developed and its performance characteristics determined by the\nas required\nby CLIA '88 regulations.

DNA extracted from a\ncorresponding\nblood specimen was used as a normal reference control.\nH and E slide was examined and no microdissection was needed.\nTEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA (baseline)/ Tumor DNA\npairs using 3\nmarkers at both 1 p and 19q. The 3 markers on 1 p are D1 S548, D1 S1592, and D1 S552 (with D1 S468,\nD1 S1612, and\nD1S496 as backup markers) and the 3 markers on 19q are D19S219, D19S412, and PLA2G4C (with\nD19S606 and\nD19S1182 as backup). All markers are microsatellites (2 or 4 nt repeats) except PLA2G4C which is a\nminisatellite (26\nnt repeat) polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score, amplicon size, and\nease of\ninterpretation. The backup markers are used if the first line markers at that chromosome arm are\nuninformative or\notherwise ambiguous in their interpretation.

Assessment of MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite\ntreatment of\nDNA followed by real-time PCR amplification of methylated and unmethylated DNA\nsequences. The\nanalytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by serial dilution of methylated positive control DNA into\nunmethylated DNA, and was assessed to be 1% of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated\nDNA.

There is no evidence of allelic loss on the short arm of chromosome 1 (1p).  19q intact: A majority of nuclei showed similar numbers of 19q13 and 19p13 signals. THere is no evidence of allelic loss of 19q.  Allelic loss at one locus does not necessarily predict the presence of alterations at other loci on the same chromosome, i.e. FISH may not detect partial allelic loss. FISH may not detect allelic losses if there is loss of one allele and replication on the allele.  \nComment:  \nSeveral days after unstained slides from block A2 were received, additional unstained slides from \nblock B1 were received. This was discussed with Dr. Mark Cohen on 2011. The unstained slides from \nblock B1 will not be stained and will be returned.  \n Allelic loss on chromosome 1p has been shown to correlate with with chemoresponsiveness and long progression-free surival in some gliomas. This correlation is stronger when there is concomitant allelic loss on 19q. An association of chemoresponsiveness and/or long progression-free survivl with allelic loss on 19q in the absence of loss on 1p has not been established. In patients with 1p/19q loss,\n \nMethod:   \nThe integrity of the short arm of chromosome 1 (1p) and long arm of chromosome 19 (19q) was \nevaluated with interphase florescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using locus-specific probes target (1p36, 19q13) and reference probes (1q25,19p13) (Abbott Meloecular/Vysis, des Plaines, IL). The analysis was performed on areas of glial neoplasm and only atypical nuclei with two or more reference probe signals were counted. Reported quantitavtive data represents an average of 40 nuclei. Loss is defined as a ratio of less than or eugual to 0.7./ Aneusomy is defined as a mean of greater that or equal to 3.0 for the reference probe signals (1q25, 19p13).  \n \nANALYTE SPECIFIC REAGENT (ASR) DISCLAIMER \nNOTE:  One or more of the reagents used to perform assays on this specimen MAY have contained \ncomponents considered to be analyte specific reagents (ASRs).

Deep to cyst wall: White matter with cyst wall lined by moderately cellular, viable tumor.\nComment :This astrocytoma diffusely infiltrates white and gray matter. In some areas, especially the cyst\nwall, the cells are as^ocjated with prominent microcystic change. Tumor cells have moderately\npleomorphic astrocytic nuclei, some naked and others with gemistocytic cytoplasm; other areas have a\nmore round, monotonous pattern suggestive of an oligodendroglioma component. Immunostain for p53 is\ndiffusely positive, however, arguing against an oligodendroglioma. Perineuronal satellitosis is seen. No\nevidence of an underlying grade 1 tumor is seen (i.e. no EGBs, Rosethal fibers or noninfiltrative areas).\nNo mitoses are present. Though the cellularity and pleomorphism are in some areas pronounced, no\nmitoses, vascular endothelial proliferation or necrosis are present. Immunostain for MIB-1 (slide C3)\nshows a nuclear labeling rate of up to 6% (rates of greater than 3% are considered likely to represent\nanaplastic change by Burger et al., Surgical Pathology of the Nervous System and its Coverings, 4th ed.).\nThus the tumor is WHO grade 2, but is likely to represent early anaplastic change .Molecular testing for\nMGMT, 1 p 19q are in progress.\nBRAIN :Resection\nMACROSCOPIC\nSpecimen Type\nX Resection\nSpecimen Size\nGreatest dimension : 4.3 x 4 x up to 2.7 cm\nTumor Site\nX Cerebrum: right frontal\nTumor Size\nX Cannot be determined\nMICROSCOPIC\nHistologic Type\nX Astrocytoma, diffuse\nHistologic Grade\nX WHO Grade 2\ngaged o 7 Margins\nX Cannot be assessed\n*Additional Studies , .\n*-X-Molecular testing (specify): See above\nFrozen Section Diagnosis:\nA.

The differential diagnosis is between lymphoma and a \nglioma. \n,u>'~\"~rIVE CONSULTATION: Astrocytoma, anaplastic \nGROSS PATHOLOGY: Specimen received in a container labeled with the \npatient's name and MRN. A portion of this specimen is used for the \nintraoperative consultation and for fixation in glutaraldehyde for \neventual electron microscopy. The total amount of tissue removed \nequals \napproximately 5.0 9 and all remaining fragments are submitted in six \ntissue cassettes. \nMICROSCOPIC: Fragments of cerebral cortex and underlying white matter \nshowing multiple, focal and diffuse infiltrates by small neoplastic \ncells that in general lack differentiation. In many areas the cells \nsurrund individual neurons and in small sites they show some degree of \ncytoplasmic differentiation which appears similar to that of an \nastrocyte. There are mUltiple perivascular nests of neoplastic cells. \nAreas of coagUlation necrosis or atypical mitosis are not readily \nidentified, however the general impression is that this pattern of \ntissue infiltrate may represent distant extension of a rather \naggressive type of undifferentiated neoplasm. \nIn summary, the impression formed at the time of the intraoperative \nconsultation that this represents a small cell glioma with very \nanaplastic features is sustained by the evidence available at this  time. In an attempt to further identify the genetic derivation of \nthese cells additional sections will be cut and reacted with various \nantisera as follows: GFAP, LCA, EMA, CK-6, Synaptophysin and MIB-1. \nIn addition one of the samples taken for electron microscopy will be \nevaluated. \nAn addendum will be issued when all of these are completed. \nCOMMENT: Additional sections were cut from several blocks and reacted \nwith the following antisera: LCA, EMA, CK-6, and Synaptophysin; these \nare negative in all the neoplastic cells. These results are \ninterpreted as confirming the initial impression that the derivation \nof \nthese cells is not from lymphocytes, neuronal elements, or epithelial \ncells. GFAP is expressed by approximately 20% of the neoplastic \ncells. \nMIB-1: This protein is expressed by diverse percentages of cells in \nvarious locations; however! the mean percentage of cells expressing \nthis protein is estimated to be about 10%. \nSections evaluated with the electron microscope confirm the impression \nthat the cytoplasmic features as well as the nuclei of most neoplastic \ncells are compatible with those characteristic of a neoplastic \nastrocyte. \nA letter from Dr. \nin agreement with \ninvoluntary delay in the issuance of this final report represents a \ncombination of simultaneous events including my absence from the \ndepartment for over two weeks, and the fact that the slides were is \nmailed \nto Dr. IIIIIIIfor consultation before dictating the addendum, and his \nreply was not opportunely delivered to the pathologist on call during \nmy absence . .... \nTISSUE COMMITTEE CODE: II1II \nBILLING CODESIIIIIIIII ",

There is no evidence of allelic loss on the short arm of chromosome 1 (1p).  19q intact: A majority of nuclei showed similar numbers of 19q13 and 19p13 signals. There is no evidence of allelic loss of 19q.  Allelic loss at one locus does not necessarily predict the presence of alterations at other loci on the same chromosome, i.e. FISH may not detect partial allelic loss. FISH may not detect allelic losses if there is loss of one allele and replication on the allele.  \nComment:  \nAllelic loss on chromosome 1p has been shown to correlate with with chemoresponsiveness and long \nprogression-free survival in some gliomas. This correlation is stronger when there is concomitant \nallelic loss on 19q. An association of chemoresponsiveness and/or long progression-free survival with allelic loss on 19q in the absence of loss on 1p has not been established. In patients with 1p/19q loss,\n \nMethod:   \nThe integrity of the short arm of chromosome 1 (1p) and long arm of chromosome 19 (19q) was \nevaluated with interphase florescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using locus-specific probes target (1p36, 19q13) and reference probes (1q25,19p13) (Abbott Melecular/Vysis, des Plaines, IL). The analysis was performed on areas of glial neoplasm and only atypical nuclei with two or more reference probe signals were counted. Reported quantitative data represents an average of 40 nuclei. Loss is defined as a ratio of less than or equal to 0.7./ Aneusomy is defined as a mean of greater that or equal to 3.0 for the reference probe signals (1q25, 19p13).  \n \nANALYTE SPECIFIC REAGENT (ASR) DISCLAIMER  \nThis test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the Pathology and \nLaboratory Medicine Institute at the Cleveland Clinic. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not approved or cleared this test; however, FDA clearance or approval is not currently required for clinical use. \n \nNOTE:  One or more of the reagents used to perform assays on this specimen MAY have contained \ncomponents considered to be analyte specific reagents (ASRs).

Malignant glioma, pleomorphic, superficial (WHO III). \n2. MIB-l proliferation index: 35%. \nSee Microscopy Description and Comment. \nCOMMENT \nThe neoplasm is a malignant proliferation of spindle/epithelioid cells that \nhave prominent pleomorphism, focally brisk mitotic activity, and a high MIB-l \nproliferation index of about 35% throughout. The tumor is superficial, is \ngrowing focally in the leptomeningeal space, and has a prominent reticulin \nnetwork. The tumor heavily infiltrates the brain, at its margins has \nastrocytic differentiation, and contains numerous eosinophilic granular \nbodies. Xanthomatous cells are found occasionally. \nOverall, the histological features are more consistent with an anaplastic \npleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (PXA) , in spite of the paucity of GFAP \nexpression, a feature that has been observed in some PXAs, particularly when \ntransformed into anaplastic tumors. The possibility of this tumor being a \ngliosarcorna has been considered; however the absence of a clear sarcomatous \npattern, microvascular cellular proliferation, and tumor necrosis does not \nsupport that diagnosis at this point. \nThe features in the biopsy may be correlated with clinical, imaging, and \n~oerative findings for their final interpretation and patient's follow up. \nPage 1  INTRA-OPERATIVE CONSULTATION \nA. \n\"Brain, right frontal lesion, biopsy\": \n1.
