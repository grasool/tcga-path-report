Microsatellite instability is not detected in the carcinoma by immunohistochemistry ;therefore ,the likelihood that the
carcinoma is due to sporadic or hereditary (i.e.: Lynch syndrome -associated )defective DNA mismatch repair is very low.
However ,immunohistochemistry may not detect rare polymorphisms or missense mutations in DNA mismatch repair proteins
in up to 10% of cases .If strong clinical suspicion persists, additional testing is suggested.
Archived slides and paraffin blocks were reviewed for case block Al0 containing normal tissue and carcinoma was selected for MSI analysis.
Irnmamohistochemical studies were performed on formalin fixed ,paraffin -embedded tissue with adequate positive and negative control sections, including internal
positive control tissue.
The performance characteristics of these antibodies were determined by the _
They have not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration .The FDA has
determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary .These tests are used for clinical purposes .They should not be regarded as investigational or for research.

findings indicate an intact mismatch repair (MMR) gene function without evidence of significant microsatellite instability (MSI).
Although these findings make the diagnosis of hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer (HNPCC) or Lynch Syndrome very unlikely

SPECIMEN (S) SUBMITTED :GROSS DESCRIPTION
Right colon: In formalin labeled ""right colon"" is a 25 cm in length segment of cecum and right colon with an attached 20 cm of
terminal ileum and a 6 cm attached appendix. Within the right colon there is a 4.2 x 4 cm endophytic tumor with raised rolled
borders. This tumor is 9 cm from the distal margin and 24.5 cm from the proximal margin. The tumor invades into and through
the bowel wall into the pericolonic fat and is grossly 3 cm from the circumferential soft tissue margin. The tumor also appears to
near the serosa/peritonealized surface of the attached fat. There is an additional 4 x 3 cm polypoid mass 4.5 cm from the distal
margin and 29 cm from the proximal margin. The mucosa and wall adjacent to this mass is ragged, disrupted and hemorrhagic
with hemorrhage and necrosis in the surrounding pericoloic soft tissues. No gross invasion beyond the wall is noted and this
mass is 6 cm from the circumferential soft tissue margin. Within the cecum there is an additional 4.5 x 2.7 x 1.8 cm exophytic
polypoid mass. This mass is 17 cm from the distal margin and 22 cm from the proximal margin. Again, no invasion through the
wall is noted and the mass is 9 cm from the circumferential soft tissue margin. The remaining colonic mucosa is tan-pink with
several additional smaller, up to 0.6 cm, mucosal polyps and focal areas of congestion. The ileal mucosa is tan-pink with a few
polypoid projections and a 2.3 x 1.3 cm flat granular area 6 cm from the proximal margin and 27 cm from the distal margin. No
invasion into the mesenteric fat is noted and the lesion is 3.5 cm from the mesenteric resection margin. The cut surfaces of the
appendix display a lumen lined by congested mucosa. Multiple lymph nodes are identified in the attached fat. Representative
sections are submitted as labeled: A-C tumor in ascending colon to pericolonic fat and serosal/peritonealized surface; D-E distal
ascending colon polypoid mass with adjacent ragged hemorrhagic disrupted area; F-G cecal polypoid mass; H smaller colonic
mucosal polyps; I flat and granular irregular area in small bowel; J small bowel mucosa with small polypoid projections; K distal
margin and en face circumferential soft tissue margin; L proximal margin and appendix; M six lymph nodes; N six lymph nodes;
0 six lymph nodes; P six lymph nodes.

microscopic Exam ination
Microscopic examination is performed. Within part A, the fallopian tube
fimbria demonstrates a focal area of mild cytologic atypic.
Immunohistochemistry of this area (block Al) reveals weak/low cytokeratin 7,
p53 and Ki67 expression. Cytokeratin 20, Pax8 and CDX2 are negative. In
comparison, the tumor present in the colon demonstrates strong cytokeratin 20
and CDX2 expression and is negative for Pax8, p53, and cytokeratin 7. Ki6'7 is
moderately elevated. Overall, the findings in the fallopian tube are felt to
be secondary to cautery artifact. Dr. has reviewed parts of this case
and concurs with the interpretation.

consisting of 6 em. of terminal ileum \·lith 50 em of contiguous 
colon. There is a 30 x 11 x 1 em. portion of omentum which is 
adherent to the outer aspect of the colon wall over an area 6 x 5 
em, with induration of the omentum in that area. The serosal 
surface 
the of the bowel away from where the omentum is attached is glistening 
and tan-pink. No appendix is present with the specimen. The bm·1el

colon averages 8.5 em. in circumference. The mucosa of the small 
bowel is tan-pink, smooth, and glistening, with a normal pattern of 
folds. There are no focal lesions in the small bowel. The colon is 
notable for a circumferential mass, with the bowel 12 em. in 
circumference in this region, with this mass 9 em. long and 
maximally 1.2 em. thick. Sectioning through the mass reveals the 
tumor to invade through the bowel wall into fat in the region with 
adherent omentum noted above, appearing to involve the omentum. The 
tumor comes very near to1 but does not clearly reach1 the outer

 GROSS DESCRIPTION 
             A.  Received fresh subsequently fixed in formalin labeled              ""sigmoid, upper rectum with adherent posterior bladder 
wall 
    and small intestines"".  The specimen consists of a rectosigmoid 
    colon with adherent portions of small bowel and possible portion of 
    bladder.  A segment of small bowel was 12 cm long, stapled at both     ends, which are arbitrarily inked blue and black.  A portion of 
    colon is 46 cm long.  Both ends are stapled, inked blue and the 
    opposite is opened and is inked black.  There is also a small 
    portion of possible bladder, which is 7 x 5 cm.  This is smooth to 
    slightly velvety and the margin of this is inked blue.  Orientation     cannot be determined.  One end away from the tumor is inked blue. 
    The opposite end close to the tumor is inked black.  The specimen 
is     opened to show a large fungating mass, which is 12 x 11.5 x 3.5 cm. 
    This comes within 2.5 cm of the black inked margin.  This tumor is     centrally necrotic and goes through the wall of the colon, into the 
    surrounding fat and through the wall of the small bowel into the 
    mucosa of the small bowel.  The remainder of the mucosa of small 
    bowel is pink- tan smooth glistening with normal slightly dilated 
    poles having an average circumference of 6.5 cm and the mucosal 
    alteration of tumor is 3.5 x 3.5 cm.  This comes within equidistant 
    luminal margins of the small bowel.  The tumor also comes through 
    the wall into the fat and possibly involves the mucosa of the 
    portion of bladder.  This is velvety, coming within 0.5 cm of the 
    nearest peripheral margin.  The remainder of the mucosa of the     specimen is pink- tan smooth glistening with an average 
circumference                                        of 9.5 cm.  The tumor comes within 1.5 cm of being circumferential 
    and shows a markedly necrotic central focus.  Lymph nodes are 
    grossly identified.  Representative sections of the specimen are     submitted as follows:

           B.  Received in formalin labelled ""appendix"" is a 6.3 x 0.7 
cm           appendix 
    which is partially covered with pink- tan smooth glistening serosa 
    and yellow 
    lobular fat.  The specimen is sectioned to show an intact wall with 
    an average thickness of 0.4 cm.  The lumen ranges from pinpoint to 
    0.4 cm and shows 
    possible diverticula present.  No other discrete gross lesions are 
    identified.  The entire specimen with the exception of the fat is     submitted in t settes.  AS- 2 (fat retained), proximal end 
    inked.  AS- 2.  
 
     
 
MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION 
    A. Microscopic exam of the resection shows: 
    Histologic type:  Adenocarcinoma, not otherwise specified 
     Histologic grade:  Moderately differentiated 
    Primary tumor(pT):  Tumor invades through the entire colonic wall     and through the entire adhesed small intestinal wall into the lumen 
     of the small intestine.  The tumor also invades into the 
muscularis 
     propria of the bladder wall (pT4b). 
     Proximal margin:  Negative for tumor.      Distal margin:  Negative for tumor. 
     Circumferential (radial) margin:  Negative for tumor although not 
     truly applicable given the resection of the adhered additional 
      organs. 
     Distance of tumor from closest margin:  2.5 from one of the colonic 
     margins 
     Vascular invasion:  Not identified. 
     Regional lymph nodes (pN): 30 lymph nodes are dissected from the 
     specimen and they are all negative for metastatic (pN0).      Non- lymph node pericolonic tumor:  Present in the soft tissue 
     adhesing the small intestine and the bladder to the upper       rectal/sigmoid colon resection.  No discrete additional nodules 
of 
      
 
 
   
  
 
  pericolonic tumor seen. 
     Distant metastasis (pM):  Cannot evaluate pMX. 
     Other findings:  There is significant necrosis of the tumor in the 
     central areas.              B. Microscopic examination of the appendix reveals a 
benign 
             mucocele at the tip.  No dysplasia or malignancy is 
    identified.  There is focal fibrous obliteration of the tip 
    including obliteration of the diverticulum. There is acute serositis 
    and ahdesions.

 GROSS DESCRIPTION 
             A.  Received in formalin labeled ""apical lymph node"" is a 
             0.8 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm yellow fatty tissue fragment which may     be possible lymphoid tissue. The tissue is entirely submitted in 
one 
    cassette.   
             B. eived fresh subsequently fixed in formalin labeled              ""sigmoid and upper rectum"".  The specimen grossly consists     of a 20- cm long portion of colon which is stapled at the distal end 
    (inked black) and opened at the proximal end (inked blue).  The     serosa of the specimen is pink- tan smooth and glistening partially 
    covered with abundant yellow lobular fat. Retroperitoneal reflection     is located 6 cm from the distal margin.  The specimen is opened to 
    show a pink- tan smooth glistening mucosa with an average 
    circumference of 5.5 cm.  There is a large exophytic tumor closer 
to 
    the distal end, measuring 5.3 x 6.0 x 1.0 cm.  This is located 3.5     cm from the distal end.  The distal end has a circumference of 7.5 
    cm and the tumor comes within 0.6 cm of being circumferential.  The 
    cut surface of the tumor shows invasion into the muscularis 
propria. 
    However, no discrete invasion is grossly identified into the fat.     This comes within 2.5 cm of the radial margin. A sample was taken 
    for tissure procurement.  The remainder of the mucosa is pink- tan 
    smooth and glistening with normal to slightly dilated folds.  No     other discrete gross lesions are identified in the mucosa. Multiple 
    lymph nodes are grossly identified in the fat which are firm and     somewhat enlarged up to 1.7 cm in greatest dimension. 
    Representative sections of the specimen are submitted as follows: 
    Block 1 - representative luminal margin; block 2- 4 - representative 
    section of tumor which includes tumor to normal and tumor into fat;     block 5 - representative radial margin; block 6 - one possible

GROSS DESCRIPTION 
             Received fresh in a container labeled ""right hemicolectomy"" 
             is a segment of bowel consisting of 6 cm of terminal ileum 
    with contiguous 23 cm of proximal colon.  The serosal surface is 
    glistening and tan- pink, and there is a moderate amount of attached 
    adipose tissue.  There is an unremarkable appendix present, 
    measuring 6.5 cm long x 0.7 cm in diameter.  On cut surface, it is 
    without focal lesion, without gross evidence of inflammation. The 
    bowel measures 3.6 cm and 8 cm in circumference at the proximal and 
    distal resection margins respectively.  The bowel is opened, and 
    there is a circumscribed 5.3 x 5 cm rubbery white- pink mass located 
    11 cm proximal to the distal margin.  A portion of tumor and of 
    normal tissue are submitted for tissue procurement per the clinical 
    requested.  On sectioning, the tumor has a maximum thickness of 1.6 
    cm, and grossly extends through the musuclaris propria and into 
    surrounding adipose tissue.  It is 1 cm from the outer surface of 
    the specimen.  The remainder of the bowel wall averages 0.5 cm thick 
    and has a tan- pink glistening mucosa with a normal pattern and 
    folds. The adipose tissue is dissected, and soft tan lymph nodes are 
    identified up to 1.8 cm in greatest dimension.  RS- 17, following 
    fixation.

GROSS DESCRIPTION 
             Received fresh for tissue procurement labeled ""right 
             hemicolectomy with en bloc"" is a previously unopened, 24 cm 
    segment of proximal right colon with attached 17 cm of distal ileum 
    surfaced by smooth to scabrous tan- pink serosa with a moderate 
    amount of attached mesocolon, mesentery and unremarkable omentum. 
    An irregular 5 x 5 x 2.5 cm fragment of red- brown skeletal muscle is 
    present in the vicinity of the cecal pouch.  The cauterized surface 
    of the portion of abdominal wall is inked blue (representing true 
    surgical resection margin in that area).  A scant amount of adherent 
    omentum and retracted serosal surface are also present in the 
    vicinity of the attached portion of abdominal wall (subsequently 
    inked orange and representing the free radial serosal surface).  An 
    unremarkable 7.2 cm in length, 0.9 cm in diameter appendix is 
    present.  The proximal and distal margins measure 4 and 8 cm in 
    circumference respectively.  On opening, there is a nearly 
    circumferential rubbery tan- white tumor mass at the ileocecal valve 
    measuring 11.0 x 5.7 cm.  On sectioning, the tumor has a maximal 
    thickness of 2.8 cm, grossly extending into the muscularis to within 
    0.5 cm of the inked cauterized resection margin (abdominal wall) 
    (see paired contiguous sections blocks 2&3 and 4&5) and within 0.6 
    cm of the inked free radial serosal surface (see bisected contiguous 
    sections block 6 and 7).  The ileal and remaining colonic mucosa is 
    unremarkable glistening tan- pink with regular folds and the walls 
    average 0.4 cm in thickness.  Two palpable rubbery tan- pink-red 
    apical lymph nodes averaging 1.3 cm in greatest dimension are 
    recovered from the attached mesocolon.  Numerous additional rubbery 
    pale tan lymph nodes, 2.8 cm in greatest dimension, are recovered 
    from the remainder of the mesocolon and mesentery.  A portion of 
    tumor and a portion of normal mucosa are submitted for tissue 
    procurement as requeste  presentative sections are submitted in 
    25 blocks as labeled.  -

             unopened 30 cm.  segment of proximal right colon with 
    attached 8 cm. of distal ileum surfaced by smooth tan pink serosa 
    with a copious amount of attached, mesocolon, mesentery, and 
    unremarkable omentum.  No appendix is identified.  The proximal and 
    distal margins measure 4.0 and 8.0 cm. in circumference 
    respectively.  On opening, there is a moderately well circumscribed, 
    4.5 x 3.8 cm. rubbery tan white- pink tumor mass located 9 cm. distal 
    to the ileocecal valve.  A portion of tumor and a portion of normal 
    mucosa are submitted for tissue procurement as requested.  On 
    sectioning, the tumor has a maximal thickness of 1.8 cm., grossly 
    extending into the muscularis to within 0.6 cm. of the inked free 
    radial serosal surface. A few soft tan ink polypoid lesions 
    measuring up to 0.6 cm. in greatest dimension are present throughout 
    the remainder of the colon.  The ileal and remaining colonic mucosa 
    is unremarkable, glistening tan pink with regular folds and the 
    walls average 0.5 cm. in thickness.  Multiple soft to slightly 
    rubbery pale tan to tan- red tissues in keeping with lymph nodes

GROSS DESCRIPTION 
             A. Received fresh in a container labeled ""colon"" is a 
             segment of colon 23 cm long.  The specimen is received open 
    at both ends, which are arbitrarily inked blue and black.  The 
    serosal surface is tan- pink and glistening.  There is abundant 
    attached yellow adipose tissue.  There is also abundant omentum 
    present, 42 x 5 x 3 cm in greatest dimensions.  The omentum is 
    serially sectioned, and there are no focal lesions.  The segment of 
    bowel is opened.  It averages 6.5 cm in circumference.  5.5 cm from 
    the black- inked end of the specimen, there is a 5.5 x 5 x 3.8 cm 
    tumor mass.  On cut surface, this tumor grossly invades into, and 
    apparently through, the muscularis propria, into surrounding soft 
    tissues.  Although extending near to the serosal surface, tumor does 
    not appear to reach the serosal surface, and is not near the radial 
    margin.  The surface deep to the tumor is inked.  3.5 cm from the 
    blue- inked margin is a separate 3.5 x 3.3 x 2.7 cm polypoid lesion. 
    There is some black tattooing in this region.  On cut surface, the 
    polypoid lesion is exophytic, without definite gross invasion into 
    the bowel wall.  The specimen away from the lesions has a tan- pink 
    glistening mucosa and tan wall.  The adipose tissue is dissected, 
    and multiple tan lymph nodes are identified. RS- 22, following 
    fixation. 
 
    BLOCK SUMMARY:  A1,A2 - omentum; A3 - proximal and distal resection 
    margins; A4- A7 - invasive tumor mass, with one lymph node also 
    included in block A7; A8- A16 - entire polypoid lesion; A17- A22 - 
    lymph nodes. 
 
             B.  Received fresh in a container labeled ""B - small bowel 
             mass"" is a portion of tan tissue with mucosa along one 
    surface, 3 x 2 cm, and 0.3 cm deep, compatible with small bowel.  On 
    the serosal surface there is a tan- white plaque-l ike area, 0.8 x 0.5 
    x 0.1 cm.  A section is submitted for frozen section, including the 
    plaque- like area, and the remainder of the specimen is entirely 
    submitted for permanent sections in three additional blocks. 
             C.  Received in formalin in a container labeled ""appendix"" 
             is a 5.5 cm long x 0.7 cm in diameter appendix.  It is 
    grossly unremarkable, with a tan- pink glistening serosal surface, 
     wall, and tan mucosa.  There are no focal lesions.  AS- 1.

GROSS DESCRIPTION 
             A.  Received fresh in a container labeled ""sigmoid colon"" 
             is a 24 cm long segment of colon, which is received open at 
    one end, which is inked black black, and which is stapled at the 
    opposite end, which is inked blue.  It is 5 cm in circumference at 
    the open end of the specimen, and 9 cm in circumference at the 
    stapled end of the specimen.  The serosal surface is generally 
    tan- pink and glistening, with an area with tattoo pigmented 11 cm 
    from the open end of the specimen.  There is a palpable mass within 
    the bowel in this area, although there is not gross tumor 
    penetration to the serosal surface.  The specimen is opened, 
    revealing a near circumferential 7.5 x 6.5 x 1.5 cm mass lesion, 
    coming to within 4.5 cm of the open end of the specimen.  On cut 
    suface, there is invasion of tumor through the full thickness of the 
    bowel wall and into the surrounding adipose tissue, but the tumor is 
    not near the radial margin.  The mucosa away from this area is area 
    is tan- pink and glistening, with multiple polyps, ranging from 0.3 
    cm to 0.7 cm in greatest dimension.  There is no other worrisome 
    lesion in the bowel.  The adipose tissue is dissected, and multiple 
    soft tan- pink lymph nodes are identified.  RS- 16, according to the 
    accompanying block summary, following fixation. 
 
    BLOCK SUMMARY:  A1 - proximal and distal resection margins; A2- A6 - 
    polyps; A7 - radial margin; A8- A10 - tumor; A11- A15 - lymph nodes, 
    h multiple lymph nodes per block; A16 - one sectioned lymph node. 
     
 
             B.  Received fresh in a container labeled ""segment for 
             liver lesion"" is a wedge- shaped portion of tissue, with a 
    generally tan glistening capsular surface, but with an area of 
    tan- white discoloration on the capsular surface, and with the 
    non- capsular surface of the biopsy irregulary roughened and 
    cauterized.  The specimen spans an area 2 x 1.5 x 1.1 cm.  On cut 
    surface there is a nodular area approximately 0.6 cm in greatest 
    extent in the subcapsular region, corresponding to the discoloraton 
    noted on the capsular surface.  Two sections are submitted for 
    frozen section, with the apparent lesion in block BFS1, and the 
    remainder of the specimen is submitted for permanent sections one 
    additional block.

    opening, there is a nearly circumferential, 10.8 x 8 cm partially 
    necrotic dusky tan- gray-red tumor mass, 4 cm distal to the ileocecal 
    valve.  On sectioning, the tumor has a maximum thickness of 2.4 cm, 
    grossly extending into the muscularis to within 1.1 cm of the inked 
    free radial serosal surface.  The ileal and remaining colonic mucosa 
    is unremarkable, glistening tan- pink with regular folds and the 
    walls average 0.5 cm in thickness.  Several slightly rubbery pale 
    tan- white tissues in keeping with lymph nodes measuring up to 1.4 cm

GROSS DESCRIPTION
A.Received fresh, subsequently fixed in formalin, labeled
""sigmoid colon"". The specimen consists of a 22 cm. long
portion of colon which is stapled at the proximal end, opened at the
distal end. The proximal end is inked blue and the distal end is
inked black. The specimen is opened to show a pink tan smooth
glistening mucosa with normal to abundant folds. The circumference
of the proximal end is 4.5 cm. and the circumference at the distal
end is 7.5 cm. The specimen shows a 4.8 x 3.5 x 1 cm. tumor which
comes within 5 cm. of the distal margin. The serosa of the specimen
is pink tan smooth glistening and predominantly covered with yellow
lobular fat. The specimen shows a 2.5 x 1.5 cm. serosal
umbilication. This umbilication is inked blue. The tumor also shows
gross invasion through the muscularis propria into the fat. Multiple
lymph nodes are grossly identified in the surrounding fat. There is
a focus of mesenteric margin (peduncle) which feels somewhat
indurated. The proximal lymph node may be present in this area.
There is also a 1.5 x 1.5 irregular indurated focus on the surface
coming in within 9 cm. of the proximal margin. The cut surface of
this induration site shows possible tumor present. There is also a
small polyp grossly identified which is 0.5 cm. this is located 3
cm. from the distal margin. This polyp shows no invasion grossly
identified. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted
for tissue procurement. Representative sections of the remainder of
the specimen are submitted as follows:
BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 - Representative luminal margins; 2 - mesenteric
margin shave; 3 - polyp full thickness; 4 - tumor to serosal
umbilication; 5 - tumor to normal; 6 - tumor to fat; 7 - radial
margin; 8 - indurated surface nodule with possible tumor; 9-12 -
nine possible lymph nodes each; 13 - four possible lymph node; 14 -
lymph node at mesenteric peduncle bisected; 15 - rPnresentative
section of possible mottled lymph node. RS15
B.Received in formalin labeled ""appendix"" is a 6 x 0.5
cm.unremarkable appendix partially covered with pink tan
smooth glistening serosa and yellow lobular fat. The specimen is
sectioned to show an intact wall with an average thickness of 0.3
cm. The lumen ranges from pinpoint to 0.??. Representative sections
of the specimen are submitted in one cassette with the proximal end
inked. RS1
MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
Microscopic sections of the sigmoid tumor reveals a
moderate to poorly differentiated colonic adenocarcinoma
which has extended through the bowel wall into the mesenteric fat. The area of irregular indurated soft tissue at the mesenteric root
does not contain any carcinoma. There are three positive mesenteric
lymph nodes present. One of these is present at the mesenteric root
and represents the most proximal lymph node in the dissection.
There is a soft tissue metastasis present in the mesentery as well.
The results of the evaluation of the resection are summarized in the
following template.
Histologic type: Adenocarcinoma.
Histologic grade: Moderate to poorly differentiated.
Primary tumor (pT): Tumor invades through the colon wall into the
mesenteric fat (pT3).
Proximal margin: Negative.
Distal margin: Negative.
Circumferential (radial) margin: Negative.
Vascular invasion: Negative.

CLINICAL NOTES
GROSS DESCRIPTION
A.Received fresh, then fixed in formalin, labeled
""sigmoid colon"", is an 18 cm. long portion of colon, opened
at one end (inked blue) and stapled at the opposite end (inked
black). The specimen is partially covered with pink-tan, smooth and
glistening serosa. Externally, there is a focus of adhesions, 4 x 3
cm., located 3.5 cm. from the nearest luminal margin (inked black).
The mucosa is pink-tan, smooth and glistening, with normal to
abundant folds, and average circumference of 6 cm. There is a 4 x
3.5 cm. ulcerated tumor, 3.5 cm. from the nearest luminal margin
(inked black), and contiguous with the focus of serosal adhesions.
This focus of adhesion is inked blue. The tumor shows gross
invasion into the muscularis propria, and appears to penetrate
through the fat, to within 0.3 cm. of the surgical margin of the
adhesion. The focus of the radial margin is grossly unremarkable.
The remainder of the mucosa is pink-tan, smooth and glistening, with
two polypoid lesions, 0.3 cm. in greatest dimension, located within
2 cm. of the black inked margin and 5.5 cm. of the blue inked
margin. These show no gross invasion. Lymph nodes are identified
in the fat. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted as
follows:

Transverse colon cancer with clinical obstruction Gross Description
Received fresh labeled ""right hemicolectomy"" is a previously unopened
40 cm segment of proximal right colon with attached 15 cm of distal
ileum and an abundant amount of attached mesocolon, mesentery, and
omentum. An unremarkable 9 cm appendix averaging 0.5 cm in diameter is
present. The proximal and distal margins measure 5.2 and 7.8 cm in
circumference respectively. On opening, there is a circumferential,
6.0 x 3.9 cm rubbery tan-white-red tumor mass which is 8 cm from the
distal margin. On sectioning, the tumor has a maximal thickness of 2
cm, grossly extending through the muscularis and into the attached
mesocolon. The tumor is present within 0.2 cm of the inked free radial
serosal surface and visually appears to extend into the attached
omentum. A 3 cm in greatest dimension area of tan red discoloration is
noted within the distal ileum, 5 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve.
The remaining ileal and colonic mucosa is unremarkable tan-pink with
regular folds and the walls average 0.5 cm. A portion of tumor and a
portion of normal colonic mucosa are submitted for tissue procurement
as requested. Multiple soft to slightly rubbery tan-pink tissues in
keeping with lymph nodes measuring up to 1.3 cm are recovered from the
attached mesocolon and mesentery. RS 21

Diagnosis:
1.: Tumor-free lipomatous atrophic lymph node.
2.: Right hemicolectomy specimen with tumor-free resection margins and under inclusion
of an ulcerated, malignant, solid tumor in the cecum, conforming to the type of a poorly
differentiated adenocarcinoma, with infiltration of the lamina muscularis propria and
without regional lymph node metastases (G3, pT2 LO VO RO pNO 0/27).
Additional immunohistological investigations are being conducted due to the histological
peculiarities of the tumor. A follow-up report on this will be submitted at a later date.
Follow-up report:
From an immunohistological perspective ,the tumor cells were positive for broad-
spectrum cytokeratins .Large numbers of CD3- positive and CD20-negative or T-
lymphocytes are also interspersed.
Based on the histology and immunohistology ,this is thus a poorly differentiated
colorectal adenocarcinoma ,or cecum carcinoma ,with a dense lymphocytic stromal
infiltrate.
The poor tumor differentiation and the dense lymphocytic inflammatory infiltration may
be indicators of the presence of a microsatellite unstable (possibly HNPCC- associated)
colorectal carcinoma.

leads to the question of whether there are clinical indications for a lymphatic leukemia.,If

Diagnosis:
•The material in I is a partial resection of small intestine with reactive lesions,
The material in 11 is a preparation of the rectosigmoid colon (in clinical terms attributable
to the rectum or the sigmoid colon) with a poorly differentiated carcinoma in the area of the
rectosigmoid junction (G3), with infiltration of blood and lymph vessels (L1, V 1) and a
lymph node metastasis (pN 1).
Locally, the lesion was completely removed.
The distance from the mesorectal fascia was at least 1 cm.
The overall clinical findings and the topography should serve to determine whether this is a
rectal carcinoma in the narrower sense of the term or a carcinoma of the sigmoid colon.

Diagnosis /Diagnoses:
Colon ( sigmoid )resection specimen with bland diverticuli ,unremarkable oral and aboral
resection margins and including an ulcerated ,moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with
infiltration of the lamina muscularis propria (G2, pT2).
A follow-up report on the lymph node status will be issued.
Follow-up report:
34 lymph nodes of up to 0.9 cm in size were dissected out from the pericolic fatty tissue in thevicinity of the tumor after clarification with acetone.
These were found to be entirely tumor-free on microscopy.
In conclusion or in summary, therefore, a stage of pT2 pNO (0/34) is obtained.
E"," 1. ""Site"": Colon (sigmoid). Justified as the report clearly mentions the tumor's location in the sigmoid colon.
2. ""Laterality"": Not provided. The report does not mention any laterality as the tumor is in the colon which is a midline structure.
3. ""Histology"": Adenocarcinoma. Justified as the report clearly states the histology of the tumor as adenocarcinoma.
4. ""Stage"": T2 N0 (0/34). Justified as the tumor has invaded the muscularis propria (pT2) and there is no evidence of tumor in 34 dissected lymph nodes (N0).
5. ""Grade"": II. Justified as the report mentions the tumor is moderately differentiated (G2).

The report describes two separate adenocarcinoma tumors, one located in the cecum and the other at the hepatic flexure in the ascending colon.

Laterality: Not provided
The laterality of the tumors is not explicitly mentioned in the report.

Histology: Adenocarcinoma
The report clearly indicates that both tumors are adenocarcinomas, which is a type of cancer that begins in the glandular cells lining the inside of an organ.

Stage: pT3N1b
Based on the information provided in the report, both tumors have invaded through the muscularis propria into pericolorectal tissues (pT3) and have metastasized to 2-3 regional lymph nodes (N1b).

Grade: High-grade and low-grade
The cecum tumor is described as high-grade, indicating that it is poorly differentiated and more aggressive. The hepatic flexure tumor is described as low-grade, meaning that it is well to moderately differentiated and less aggressive.

Behavior: Malignant
As the report describes two adenocarcinoma tumors with invasive characteristics, the behavior of these tumors is malignant.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The specimen consists of a segment of terminal ileum, cecum, appendix and 
ascending colon with attached mesocolon and omentum. Multiple adhesions are 
seen on the surface of the specimen. The terminal ileum measures 
approximately 7.0 x 3.0 cm. The colonic and cecal segment measures 15.0 x 2.5 
cm. An area of induration and puckering is evident on the anterior aspect 
just above what appears to be ileocecal valve. Opening the colon reveals a 
large fungating ulcerated mass measuring approximately 8.0 x 9.0 cm involving 
the full circumference of the colon. It has a central area of ulceration and 
raised irregular erythematous edges. The appendix is dilated and measures 4.0 
DESCRIPTION: ~~~~~~~~=~~~~~ 
Sections through the tumor demonstrate a variable pattern. In areas, it 
consists of atypical glandular structures formed by cells with irregular and 
hyperchromatic nuclei. Additionally, areas consist of poorly differentiated 
tumor. Here, the cells form solids nests and cords of spindle and polygonal 
shaped cells without gland formation. The tumor invades the muscularis from 
an ulcerated mucosal surface and extends into serosal tissues where it is 
surrounded by a desmoplastic reaction. Sections through sixteen lymph nodes 
disclose lymphoid hyperplasia and reactive changes, but no metastatic tumor. 
The resection margins are free of tumor as well. The serosal surfaces of the

Gross Description: '''::('<=''/<=D DATE: REPORT 
Container labeled ""!!I!~~~~~~'- right colon"" is an 
approximately 14 cm previously opened moderately distorted portion 
of large bowel including cecum, as well as 4.5 cm of previously 
opened terminal ileum. The specimen is covered by a moderate amount 
of pericolic and epiploic adipose tissue in which a 4.3 x 0.6 x 0.6 
grossly unremarkable vermiform appendix is identified. The visible 
serosa is shaggy and gray-brown with several fibrofatty adhesions. 
The wall is up to 0.6 cm edematous and fibrotic. The lumen is lined 
by gray-tan mucosa with preservation of intestinal folds and a small 
amount of submucosal edema. Noted within the cecal pouch at a point 
0.3 cm from the ileocecal valve there is a previously sectioned 
moderately distorted fairly well defined approximately 3.0 x 2.8 cm 
centrally ulcerated finely granular tan brown plaque like lesion 
. with slightly raised rolled borders. This appears to have a gritty 
gray-tan fibrotic cut surface measuring up to 0.7 cm in thickness. 
This grossly appears to focally extend through the wall focally 
shallowly into the surrounding adipose tissue adjacent to the 
ileocecal valve. In addition, this lesion focally appears to extend 
into the appendiceal orifice but does not grossly appear to obstruct 
the appendix. On sectioning, the surrounding adipose tissue shows 
several poorly defined gray tan to brown nodules up to 0.6 cm. Also 
received in the same container are three tissue cassettes each 
labeled Representative sections are submitted 
labeled as follows: A -proximal margin; B -distal margin with a 
portion of proximal margin included; C-F -representative lesion and  surrounding tissue; G -random uninvolved bowel; H -representative

Gross Description: 
Container labeled ""_""'.!II_II!II- right colon"" is a 17.5 cm 
previously opened portion of large bowel including cecum, as well as 
6.6 cm of attached unopened terminal ileum. The specimen is covered 
by a moderate amount of pericolic, epiploic and omental adipose 
tissue. An 8.6 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm vermiform appendix is identified. 
The visible serosa is shaggy and gray pink. The wall is up to 0.5 cm 
edematous and fibrotic. The lumen is lined by gray-tan mucosa with 
preservation of intestinal folds. Noted within the cecal pouch at a 
point 1.2 cm from the ileocecal valve there is a 3.5 x 3.5 cm finely 
granular centrally ulcerated plaque-like gray pink lesion with 
raised rolled borders. On sectioning, this has a gritty gray-tan 
fibrotic cut surface measuring up to 1.4 cm. This grossly appears to 
extend through the wall and into the surrounding adipose tissue 
grossly to within 0.1 cm of the nearest outer surface margin. This 
lesion grossly impinges on and markedly constricts the appendiceal 
orifice. The appendiceal orifice is markedly constricted to 0.6 cm 
in diameter as opposed to 1.6 cm in diameter in the central portion 
of the appendix. The appendix has an intact gray tan fibrotic wall 
with smooth inner lining containing transparent viscid mucus. No 
gross lesion is noted within the appendix proper. On sectioning, 
the surrounding adipose tissue reveals several poorly defined gray 
tan to yellow nodules up to 2.2 cm. On sectioning the largest 
portion appears to be a mat of nodules having focally necrotic gray 
tan cut surfaces. Several of these nodules appear to be poorly 
defined and are associated with vascular structures. Also received  _tainer are three tissue cassettes each labeled

Final Diagnosis 
Distal ileum, appendix and right colon, segment: 
Tumor characteristics: 
Histologic type: Adenocarcinoma with mucinous component (see 
comment) 
Location of tumor: 1.2 cm from the ileocecal valve 
Size: 3.5 x 3.5 x 1.4 cm in greatest dimensions 
Grade: Moderately differentiated 
Lymphovascular space invasion: Yes 
Perforation of visceral peritoneum: Yes (see comment) 
Presence of mesenteric deposits: No 
Depth of invasion: Carcinoma extends through muscularis propria 
into subserosal adipose tissue with microscopic perforation. (see 
comment) 
Surgical margin status: 
Proximal margin: No carcinoma identified 
Distal margin: No carcinoma identified 
Radial deep margin: Carcinoma extends to serosal surface with 
perforation of visceral peritoneum (see comment). 
Lymph node status:

Other: 
Appendix: Mucocele. PAS 3 SPC-A 
Stage: 
pT4a N2b (see comment) 
CPT: 88309 
Comments 
The carcinoma extends up to the serosal surface and in slide F is 
associated with an area of desmoplasia-granulation tissue and 
mesothelial hyperplasia associated with the carcinoma consistent 
with an area of perforation. Therefore, this is staged as a pT4a 
lesion. Multiple lymph nodes are present within the mesentery. Some 
foci consist predominantly of adenocarcinoma with only a small 
amount of residual lymphoid tissue present and these are counted as 
lymph nodes totally replaced by tumor. Seventeen of 20 lymph nodes 
are positive for metastatic carcinoma. In addition, multiple foci of 
Iymphovascular space invasion are present within the mesentery. The 
carcinoma is an adenocarcinoma with focal mucinous component. The 
mucinous component is less than 50% of the tumor and, therefore, 
this does not qualify as a mucinous/colloid adenocarcinoma. Clinical 
correlation and followup is recommended.

diagnosis.

Gross Description: 
Received in a single container labeled"" -right colon"" 
is a previously opened portion of large bowel including cecum, as 
well as cm of previously opened portion of terminal ileum. The 
specimen is received after formalin fixation and shows the large 
bowel to measure 20.6 cm and the ileum to be 9.4 cm. The specimen is 
covered by a moderate amount of pericolic and epiploic adipose 
tissue in which an 8.0 x 0.6 x 0.6 cm grossly unremarkable vermiform 
appendix is identified. The visible serosa is shaggy gray tan to 
brown. The wall is up to 0.6 cm edematous and fibrotic. The lumen 
is lined by gray-tan mucosa with preservation of intestinal folds. 
Noted within the cecal pouch extending to the ileocecal valve is a 
4.6 x 3.0 cm centrally ulcerated finely granular tan-gray to pink 
lesion with raised rolled borders. This is stated during specimen 
opening to be noted at its nearest point 26 cm from the distal 
margin and 14 cm from the proximal margin. This has a gritty gray 
tan fibrotic cut surface measuring up to 1.9 cm in thickness. This 
grossly extends focally through the muscularis into the surrounding 
adipose tissue where it is seen at its nearest point 0.7 cm from the 
nearest outer margin. In addition, in one area the lesion 
umbilicates to the serosa and grossly appears to extend through the 
serosa. No other gross lesions are identified. On sectioning, the 
surrounding adipose tissue shows several well defined and poorly 
defined gray tan nodules measuring up to 1.2 cm in greatest 
dimension. The largest nodules have fibrotic necrotic cut surfaces.

Comments 
Grossly in one area, the lesion umbilicated to the serosa and 
grossly appears to extend through the serosa. Microscopically, 
carcinoma is present focally extending through the visceral 
peritoneum to focally involve the serosal surface. Therefore, this 
is staged as p T 4a. Eleven of 17 lymph nodes demonstrate metastatic 
carcinoma. Some of the nodes are completely replaced by carcinoma 
with no residual nodal tissue identified. These are counted as lymph 
nodes totally replaced by tumor. Therefore, this is staged as a 
pN2b. In addition, Iymphovascular space invasion is identified and 
the additional classifications of VL are therefore used. The final 
stage should be performed in conjunction with knowledge of the 
clinical stage.

bowel including cecum, as well as 8 cm of attached previously opened
terminal ileum. The specimen is covered by a moderate amount of
pericolic and epiploic adipose tissue in which a 8.4 x 0.8 x 0.8 cm
grossly unremarkable vermiform appendix is identified. The visible
serosa is foully shaggy and tan pink with a few fibrofatty
adhesions. Noted at a point approximately 9 cm from the distal
margin is a 3.3 x 3.2 cm area of indurated umbilication of the
serosa .The specimen has been received after tissue harvest for
genomic study .Within the specimen container are three tissue
cassettes each labeled ""The bowel wall is up to
0.6 cm edematous and fibrotic The lumen is lined by tan pink mucosa
with preservation of intestinal folds .In the area corresponding to
the umbilication at a point 8.6 cm from the distal margin and 3.8 cm
from the ileocecal valve is a partially sectioned 9 .2 x 7.5 cm
plaque like finely granular centrally ulcerated tan pink lesion with
raised rolled borders .This has a gritty gray tan fibrotic cut
surface measuring up to 3.2 cm in thickness. The lesion grossly
extends through the muscularis but is limited by the serosa in the
area away from the pericolic fat. In the area of the pericolic fat
the lesion grossly appears to focally extend through the wall into
the adipose tissue where it is seen at its nearest point

Clinical Information
Recurrent rectal cancer. Recurrence between J-pouch and
prostate/seminal vesicles
Gross Description
Received fresh and subsequently fixed in formalin labeled ""bladder
prostate and rectum"" is a specimen which includes a 4.3 x 3.7 white 3.7
cm prostate, an 8.5 cm portion of rectum with J-pouch, attached bladder
and prostate. The bladder is approximately 6.5 x 5.5 and is 4.0 cm
inflated. There is a catheter in the prostatic urethra and the specimen
is heavily stapled. Orientation of the specimen was reviewed by the
surgeon at time of tissue procurement. No frozen sections were
requested. Proximal end of the rectum is inked blue and the distal end of the rectum is inked black. The J-pouch of the specimen is
approximately 3 x 2.5 cm and is heavily stapled, located within 2.5 cm
of the distal margin of the rectum. The mucosa of this area is smooth
and glistening showing an average circumference of 7.5 cm in its opened
state. In the J-pouch there is a 1.2 x 0.7 cm ulcer. This comes within
2.5 cm of the distal rectal margin and 6.5 cm of the proximal rectal
margin. This comes within 1.2 cm of the anastomotic line surface of
this area shows tumor present and a scarred focus. This area of the
J-pouch is adherent to the posterior right side of the prostate. This
area is inked black. The cut surface of this area shows a white tan
scarred irregular focus which is approximately 2.5 x 2.5 x 2.5 cm. The
remainder of the cut surface of the prostate is pink-tan and diffusely
nodular. The remainder of the bladder and prostate are opened in an
anterior Y-shaped incision. Mucosa the bladder is pink-tan smooth
glistening with no other discrete gross lesions identified. The ureters
are propatent an average 4.5 x 0.3 cm. The seminal vesicles cannot be
grossly identified in a variegated and behind the rectum. Vas
deferentia cannot be grossly identified. From minimal fat is gross
identified surrounding the tissue. Possible lymph nodes may be present.
Representative sections of the specimen are submitted as follows: 1 -
representative luminal margins of the rectum, 2 - 6 - entire J-pouch
ulceration and to tumor including anastomotic line (inked blue) and
possible seminal vesicle and prostatic tissue, (from proximal to

             labeled ""rectosigmoid colon"" is a 19 cm. long portion of 
    colon which is stapled at one end (possibly proximal) inked blue and 
    the opposite end is opened and inked black. Retroperitoneal 
    reflection is located 7.5 cm. from the distal end.  The specimen is 
    otherwise covered with pink- tan, glistening serosa and abundant 
    yellow lobular fat.  The specimen is opened to show pink- tan 
    glistening mucosa with an average circumference of 5.4 cm. There is 
    a 4.5 x 3.8 x 1.0 cm. tumor coming to within 1.5 cm. from of the 
    distal margin. The cut surface of the tumor shows invasion into the 
    muscularis propria, coming to within 0.3 cm. of the radial margin. 
    This radial margin is inked orange.  No other discrete gross lesions 
    are identified.  Samples are taken for tissue procurement. Lymph 
    nodes are grossly identified in the fat, measuring up to 0.9 cm. in 
    greatest dimension.  Representative sections of the specimen are

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION 
             This tumor is a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma 
             with quite extensive invasion.  It extends through the 
  
  bowel wall and sends tongues of tumor into pericolonic fat and 
    incites a scirrhous reaction.  Because of the propensity to send 
    these narrow tongues of infiltrating tumor out into the fat, there 
    is minimal extension to the radial margin.  Also tumor nests are 
    present within soft tissue (blocks 11, 13).  Lymphatic invasion is 
    noted in the pericolonic soft tissue (block number 11).  Invasion of 
    an artery is also noted.  Please see the template below

GROSS DESCRIPTION 
             A.  The specimen is received fresh for frozen section 
             labeled ""metastatic colon cancer"".  It consists of a 
    portion of adipose tissue measuring 2.2 x 1.6 x 1 cm. In the center 
    there is a poorly demarcated firm dull tan nodule measuring 0.5 cm. 
    in diameter. A touch preparation is made and a sample is taken for 
    frozen section. The remainder of the tissue is submitted in one 
    block following fixation. 
             B.  Received fresh, subsequently fixed in formalin, labeled 
    ""rectosigmoid colon"" is a specimen that consists of a 25 cm long 
    portion of  colon.  The specimen is inked blue at the proximal end 
    and at the distal end it is inked black.  The serosa is pink- tan, 
    smooth,  glistening and predominantly fatty. There is a serosal 
    umbilication 8.0 cm. from the distal end.  The specimen shows 
    retroperitoneal reflection which is 7 cm from the distal margin. 
    The specimen is opened to show a pink- tan smooth glistening mucosa 
    with a 3.5 cm circumference at the proximal end and an 8 cm 
    circumference at the distal end. There is a nearly circumferential 
    tumor which is 6.5 x 4.5 x 0.8 cm.  On sectioning, the specimen 
    showed invasion through the muscularis propria and into the fat. 
    This is somewhat contiguous with the umbilication grossly identified 
    on the serosa of the specimen.  This area is inked blue.  Tumor 
    comes within 6.5 cm of the distal margin.  It grossly spares the 
    radial margin.  The fatty tissue is sectioned to show multiple lymph 
    nodes grossly identified which range from 0.8 cm to 2.5 cm in 
    greatest dimension.  No other discrete gross lesions are identified. 
    Representative sections of the specimen are submitted as follows: 
    Block 1 - representative luminal margins; blocks 2- 5 - 
    representative sections of tumor which include tumor to deep and 
    fat, tumor to normal and tumor to serosal umbilication; blocks 6- 13

GROSS DESCRIPTION
A.Received fresh, subsequently fixed in formalin labeled
""rectosigmoid"" is a 13 cm. long portion of colon. The specimen has
a suture marking the distal portion. This end is inked black, the
opposite end is inked blue. The ends of the specimen appear to be
not stapled. The specimen is partially covered with pink-tan,
smooth, glistening serosa and abundant yellow, lobular fat. There
is no retroperitoneal reflection. The specimen is entirely covered
with a portion of smooth, glistening serosa. The specimen is opened
to show possibly circumferential tumor which is 4.5 x 4 x 1 cm.
This comes to within 3.5 cm. of the distal margin. This shows gross
evidence through muscularis propria and into the fat, coming to
within 2.5 cm. of the radial margin. There is also a slight
umbilication in the serosa (focus is inked blue). The remainder of
the mucosa is pink-tan, smooth and glistening with normal to
slightly dilated folds, both having an average circumference of 5
cm.Lymph nodes are grossly identified in the fat. Representative
sections of the specimen are submitted as follows:
BLOCK SUMMARY: #Al - Representative luminal margin; A2 - tumor to
serosal umbilication; A3 - tumor to fat; A4 - representative radial
