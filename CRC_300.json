Within the right colon there is a 4.2 x 4 cm endophytic tumor with raised rolled\nborders. This tumor is 9 cm from the distal margin and 24.5 cm from the proximal margin. The tumor invades into and through\nthe bowel wall into the pericolonic fat and is grossly 3 cm from the circumferential soft tissue margin. The tumor also appears to\nnear the serosa/peritonealized surface of the attached fat. There is an additional 4 x 3 cm polypoid mass 4.5 cm from the distal\nmargin and 29 cm from the proximal margin. The mucosa and wall adjacent to this mass is ragged, disrupted and hemorrhagic\nwith hemorrhage and necrosis in the surrounding pericoloic soft tissues. No gross invasion beyond the wall is noted and this\nmass is 6 cm from the circumferential soft tissue margin. Within the cecum there is an additional 4.5 x 2.7 x 1.8 cm exophytic\npolypoid mass. This mass is 17 cm from the distal margin and 22 cm from the proximal margin. Again, no invasion through the\nwall is noted and the mass is 9 cm from the circumferential soft tissue margin. The remaining colonic mucosa is tan-pink with\nseveral additional smaller, up to 0.6 cm, mucosal polyps and focal areas of congestion. The ileal mucosa is tan-pink with a few\npolypoid projections and a 2.3 x 1.3 cm flat granular area 6 cm from the proximal margin and 27 cm from the distal margin. No\ninvasion into the mesenteric fat is noted and the lesion is 3.5 cm from the mesenteric resection margin. The cut surfaces of the\nappendix display a lumen lined by congested mucosa. Multiple lymph nodes are identified in the attached fat. Representative\nsections are submitted as labeled: A-C tumor in ascending colon to pericolonic fat and serosal/peritonealized surface; D-E distal\nascending colon polypoid mass with adjacent ragged hemorrhagic disrupted area; F-G cecal polypoid mass; H smaller colonic\nmucosal polyps; I flat and granular irregular area in small bowel; J small bowel mucosa with small polypoid projections; K distal\nmargin and en face circumferential soft tissue margin; L proximal margin and appendix; M six lymph nodes; N six lymph nodes;\n0 six lymph nodes; P six lymph nodes.\nCPT CODE( S): ICD-9 CODE(S):\n88342 x4, 88309 , 8721 [1539]\nEND OF REPORTFACILITY:\ncrlterla\nDiagnosis DiscrepancyYes\nPrimary Tumor Site Discrepancy\nCase is (circle):Prior Malignancy History\nDual/Synchronous Primary NeiHIPAA Discrepancy\nReviewer Initials9",

Received fresh in a container labeled \"colon\" is a \n             segment of colon 23 cm long.  The specimen is received open \n    at both ends, which are arbitrarily inked blue and black.  The \n    serosal surface is tan- pink and glistening.  There is abundant \n    attached yellow adipose tissue.  There is also abundant omentum \n    present, 42 x 5 x 3 cm in greatest dimensions.  The omentum is \n    serially sectioned, and there are no focal lesions.  The segment of \n    bowel is opened.  It averages 6.5 cm in circumference.  5.5 cm from \n    the black- inked end of the specimen, there is a 5.5 x 5 x 3.8 cm \n    tumor mass.  On cut surface, this tumor grossly invades into, and \n    apparently through, the muscularis propria, into surrounding soft \n    tissues.  Although extending near to the serosal surface, tumor does \n    not appear to reach the serosal surface, and is not near the radial \n    margin.  The surface deep to the tumor is inked.  3.5 cm from the \n    blue- inked margin is a separate 3.5 x 3.3 x 2.7 cm polypoid lesion. \n    There is some black tattooing in this region.  On cut surface, the \n    polypoid lesion is exophytic, without definite gross invasion into \n    the bowel wall.

Received fresh in a container labeled \"sigmoid colon\" \n             is a 24 cm long segment of colon, which is received open at \n    one end, which is inked black black, and which is stapled at the \n    opposite end, which is inked blue.  It is 5 cm in circumference at \n    the open end of the specimen, and 9 cm in circumference at the \n    stapled end of the specimen.  The serosal surface is generally \n    tan- pink and glistening, with an area with tattoo pigmented 11 cm \n    from the open end of the specimen.  There is a palpable mass within \n    the bowel in this area, although there is not gross tumor \n    penetration to the serosal surface.  The specimen is opened, \n    revealing a near circumferential 7.5 x 6.5 x 1.5 cm mass lesion, \n    coming to within 4.5 cm of the open end of the specimen.  On cut \n    suface, there is invasion of tumor through the full thickness of the \n    bowel wall and into the surrounding adipose tissue, but the tumor is \n    not near the radial margin.  The mucosa away from this area is area \n    is tan- pink and glistening, with multiple polyps, ranging from 0.3 \n    cm to 0.7 cm in greatest dimension.  There is no other worrisome \n    lesion in the bowel.  The adipose tissue is dissected, and multiple \n    soft tan- pink lymph nodes are identified.  RS- 16, according to the \n    accompanying block summary, following fixation. \n \n    BLOCK SUMMARY:  A1 - proximal and distal resection margins; A2- A6 - \n    polyps; A7 - radial margin; A8- A10 - tumor; A11- A15 - lymph nodes, \n    h multiple lymph nodes per block; A16 - one sectioned lymph node. \n     \n \n             B.  Received fresh in a container labeled \"segment for \n             liver lesion\" is a wedge- shaped portion of tissue, with a \n    generally tan glistening capsular surface, but with an area of \n    tan- white discoloration on the capsular surface, and with the \n    non- capsular surface of the biopsy irregulary roughened and \n    cauterized.  The specimen spans an area 2 x 1.5 x 1.1 cm.  On cut \n    surface there is a nodular area approximately 0.6 cm in greatest \n    extent in the subcapsular region, corresponding to the discoloraton \n    noted on the capsular surface.

A  palpable area \n    of induration is noted.  The omentum overlying the area is focally \n    retracted and subsequently inked orange.  The pre- serosal surface in \n    the vicinity of the palpable mass is inked black.  The undesignated \n    margins measure 6.0 and 6.5 cm. in circumference respectively.  Upon \n    opening, there is a circumferential 10.5 x 9.5 cm. focally necrotic \n    glistening tan- pink tumor mass which is 9 cm. from the larger \n     circumference margin.  On sectioning, the tumor has a maximal \n    thickness of 2.4 cm. grossly extending through the muscularis to \n     within 0.15 cm. of the inked pre- serosal surface (block 4) and \n    adherent omentum (see blocks #2 and 3).  A portion of tumor and a \n    portion of normal mucosa are submitted for tissue procurement as \n    requested.  A pedunculated 1.2 x 0.8 x 0.6 cm. tan pink- red polyp is \n    present within 2 cm. of the margin of the tumor mass (between the \n    tumor mass and the larger circumference margin).  The remaining \n    mucosa is unremarkable glistening tan- pink with regular folds and \n    the wall averages 0.7 cm.  A single shallow \n    diverticulum is also identified.  Several soft to slightly rubbery \n    mucoid- appearing tan- white tissues in keeping with lymph nodes \n    measuring up to 1.3 cm. in greatest dimension are recovered from the \n    attached mesocolon. \n    Representative sections are submitted in fifteen (15) blocks as \n    labeled:` \n    ` \n    BLOCK SUMMARY:  #1 - Undesignated margins (smaller circumference \n    margin inked \n    blue larger, circumference margin closest to tumor inked green); 2,3 \n    - tumor \n    to inked indurated omentum; 4 - tumor to inked free radial serosal \n    surface; 5 \n    - central tumor; 6 - tumor to normal mucosa; 7,8 - bisected polyp \n    (1/2 per \n    cassette); 9,10 - random from remainder of specimen; 11 - eight (8) \n    whole \n    lymph nodes; 12,13 - seven (7) whole lymph nodes per cassette; 14 - \n    six (6) \n    whole lymph nodes; 15 - one (1) bisected lymph node.        \n  \n  \n \n           B.

The specimen is partially covered with pink-tan, smooth and\nglistening serosa. Externally, there is a focus of adhesions, 4 x 3\ncm., located 3.5 cm. from the nearest luminal margin (inked black).\nThe mucosa is pink-tan, smooth and glistening, with normal to\nabundant folds, and average circumference of 6 cm. There is a 4 x\n3.5 cm. ulcerated tumor, 3.5 cm. from the nearest luminal margin\n(inked black), and contiguous with the focus of serosal adhesions.\nThis focus of adhesion is inked blue. The tumor shows gross\ninvasion into the muscularis propria, and appears to penetrate\nthrough the fat, to within 0.3 cm. of the surgical margin of the\nadhesion. The focus of the radial margin is grossly unremarkable.\nThe remainder of the mucosa is pink-tan, smooth and glistening, with\ntwo polypoid lesions, 0.3 cm. in greatest dimension, located within\n2 cm. of the black inked margin and 5.5 cm. of the blue inked\nmargin. These show no gross invasion. Lymph nodes are identified\nin the fat. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted as\nfollows:\nBLOCK SUMMARY: 1- Representative luminal margins; 2 - polyps, full\nthickness; 3-5 - representative sections of tumor, including\nrepresentative to normal and representative to surgical margin; 6 -\nsix possible lymph nodes, with representative cross sections of\nvasculature; 7 - nine lymph nodes; 8 - seven lymph nodes; 9 - three\nlymph nodes. RS-9\nB.Received in formalin, labeled \"distal margin\", is a 1.5\ncm. long portion of annular tissue, which is stapled at one\nend and opened at the opposite end. The staples are irregular.

Some \nfoci consist predominantly of adenocarcinoma with only a small \namount of residual lymphoid tissue present and these are counted as \nlymph nodes totally replaced by tumor. Seventeen of 20 lymph nodes \nare positive for metastatic carcinoma. In addition, multiple foci of \nIymphovascular space invasion are present within the mesentery. The \ncarcinoma is an adenocarcinoma with focal mucinous component. The \nmucinous component is less than 50% of the tumor and, therefore, \nthis does not qualify as a mucinous/colloid adenocarcinoma. Clinical \ncorrelation and followup is recommended. \nAt the request of the undersigned pathologist, these slides have  been additionally reviewed by Dr .... who concurs with the \ndiagnosis. \n",

Received fresh and subsequently fixed in formalin labeled \"uterus\ntubes and ovaries\" is a 294 g, supracervically amputated uterus which\nis 7.5 x 7.5 x 7.5 cm. The specimen is partially covered pink-tan\nsmooth glistening serosa showing 3 subserosal fibroid ranging from 1.3\ncm to 4.5 cm in greatest dimension. Amputation site is inked. The\nspecimen has attached bilateral fallopian tubes which are both\nfimbriated measuring 8.0 x 0.7 cm. The ovaries are also present\naveraging 3.2 x 1.7 x 1.4 cm and are pink-tan and cerebriform with a\npink-tan cystic and mottled cut surface. No papillary excrescences are\ngrossly identified. The specimen is opened show smooth glistening\nendometrium with an average thickness of 0.2 cm. The specimen is\nsectioned to show multiple intramural fibroids which range from 0.1 cm\nto 5.5 cm in greatest dimension. Due to the nodular distortion of the\nspecimen, average thickness of the myometrium cannot be grossly\ndetermined. Possible cystic spaces may be grossly identified subjacent\nto the endometrium a 1.2 cm area. This is located within 2.8 cm of the\namputation site. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted\nas follows: AFS 1 representative section of endometrium and myometrium\n,1 - representative section of amputation site 2 - 3 - representative\nendomyometrium with subjacent fibroid and area of cystic spaces, 4 -\nare present at section of 2 smaller subserosal fibroids, 5 -\nrepresentative section of large subserosal fibroid, 6 - 8 -\nrepresentative section of largest intramural fibroid, 9 -\nrepresentative right ovary, 10 - representative left ovary, 11 -\nrepresentative right fallopian tube with entire fimbria, 12 -\nrepresentative left fallopian tube with entire fimbria. RS 12\nB. Received fresh and subsequently fixed in formalin labeled \"rectum\nand sigmoid\" is a 26.5 cm long portion of rectosigmoid colon which is\npartially covered with abundant yellow lobular fat and pink-tan smooth\nglistening serosa. Retroperitoneal reflection is located 8.5 cm from\nthe distal end which is inked black. The specimen is opened to show a\n5.5 x 4.8 x 0.8 cm exophytic tumor coming within 1.9 cm of distal\nmargin. The cut surface of the tumor shows invasion into the muscularis\npropria but shows no discrete invasion into the fat. This comes within\n2.5 cm or greater of the radial margin. The remainder of the mucosa is\npink-tan smooth glistening with an average circumference of 5.5 cm\nshowing no other discrete gross lesions identified.
