Case is (circle ): UALIFifDISQUALIFIED"," 1. ""Site"": Right dorsolateral bladder wall. Justification: The report specifically mentioned the location of the tumor.
2. ""Laterality"": Right. Justification: The report clearly states that the tumor is located on the right dorsolateral bladder wall.
3. ""Histology"": High grade muscle invasive urothelial cell carcinoma +CIS. Justification: The report clearly identifies the type of cancer as high grade muscle invasive urothelial cell carcinoma +CIS.
4. ""Stage"": T3aN0Mx. Justification: The tumor has invaded the subepithelial connective tissue (T3a), there is no regional lymph node metastasis (N0), and no distant metastasis (Mx) based on the report.
5. ""Grade"": III. Justification: The report describes the tumor as high grade, which corresponds to Grade III in the given scale.
6. ""Behavior"": Malignant. Justification: The tumor is a high grade muscle invasive urothelial cell carcinoma, indicating malignant behavior."
