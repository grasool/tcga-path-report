Some of the immunohistochemistry and ISH tests were developed and their performance characteristics were determined by the
Department of Pathology. They have not been cleared or approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has
determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These tests are used for clinical purposes. They should not be
regarded as investigational or for research. This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of

Gross Description:
Received are five containers labeled with the patient 's name . The first two
containers are received without formalin for frozen section. The
remaining three containers are received with formalin.
The first is labeled ""A, left distal ureter FS"" and contains a full thickness
cross section of apparent ureter measuring 0.4 cm in diameter and 0.3 cm in
length with a small amount of associated fat. The specimen is submitted in toto
for frozen section diagnosis with the residue now resubmitted for permanent
section in cassette Al.
The second container is labeled ""B, right distal ureter"" and contains a short
segment of apparent ureter measuring 1.2 cm in length with an average diameter
of 0.6 cm .One aspect is tagged with a suture. A representative section is
submitted for frozen section diagnosis with the residue now resubmitted for
permanent section in cassette Bl. The remaining tissue is now serially
sectioned and submitted entirely in cassette B2.
The third container is labeled ""anterior exenteration ""and contains an anterior
exenteration specimen including the urinary bladder, which measures 5.5 x 4.5 x
3.2 cm, the uterus which measures 7.2 x 4.5 x 3.0 cm and an excision of vaginal
cuff surrounding the cervix measuring 5.2 x 3 .8 cm in area. The soft tissue
surfaces overlying the bladder are inked black. The irregular resection margins
surrounding the vaginal cuff are inked blue. The specimen is opened
longitudinally revealing a papillary tumor involving the approximate midline
trigone area of the bladder mucosa, measuring 1.4 x 0.9 x 0.8 cm. Adjacent to
the right of the tumor is an area of previous fulguration measuring 2.0 x 1.9 cm
in area .Combined ,these two areas measure 2.9 cm in greatest dimension.
Sectioning of this area reveals gross invasion to a depth of 1.0 cm at a
distance of 0.2 cm from the inked posterior soft tissue surface. The mass does
not grossly appear to invade the uterine cervix or other structures. Representative sections of the bladder are submitted in the following manner:
C1 urethral margin;
C2 12 to 3 o 'clock vaginal cuff mucosa margin;
C3 3 to 6 o' clock vaginal cuff mucosa margin;
C4 6 to 9 o 'clock vaginal cuff mucosa margin;
C5 9 to 12 o 'clock vaginal cuff mucosa margin;
C6-7 relationship of mass to vaginal mucosa;
C8-11 mass with deepest invasion in right posterior soft tissue;
C12 bladder dome;
C13 left bladder wall.
The uterine ectocervix is pink -tan, smooth and glistening with no grosslysuspicious lesions. The endocervix is pink-tan and velvety with a few small
cystic spaces on the cut surface containing mucoid material. Sectioning of the
myometrium reveals an average endometrial thickness of 0.3 cm and an averagemyometrial thickness of 1.0 cm .There are no grossly suspicious endometrial ormyometrial lesions .The left ovary measures 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm and has acerebriform outer surface .The attached segment of fallopian tube includes the
fimbriated end and measures 3.0 cm with an average diameter of 0.6 cm.
Sectioning of both the left adnexal structures reveals no grossly suspiciouslesions .The ovarian cut surface is white-tan and homogeneous.The rightadnexal structures include a segment of fallopian tube measuring 3.5 cm in
length with a diameter that tapers from 0.6 to 0.8 cm and an occluded fimbriated
end. The right ovary is not grossly identifiable. Sectioning reveals no grosslysuspicious lesions.
Representative sections from the uterus are submitted in the following manner:
C14 anterior cervix;
C15 posterior cervix;
C16 anterior full thickness endomyometrium;
C17 posterior full thickness endomyometrium;
C18 left adnexal structures;
C19 right adnexal structures.
The paravesical fat is trimmed and subjected to chemical clearing and Carnoy' s
solution prior to exhaustive lymph node search,which reveals a few smallpossible lymph nodes ranging in size from 0.2 to 0.3 cm in greatest dimension.The nodes are submitted entirely in cassettes C20 and C21.
The fourth container is labeled ""D, right pelvic nodes ""and contains two strips of yellow -tan lobulated fatty tissue measuring 4.2 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm and 3.5 x 1.5 x 0.6 cm .The specimen is subjected to chemical clearing in Carnoy' s solutionprior to lymph node search ,which reveals two gross lymph nodes measuring 1.4and 3 .5 cm in greatest dimension.
The specimen is submitted entirely in the following manner: D1 largest lymph node bisected;
D2 one lymph node bisected;
D3-4 remaining fatty tissue.
The fifth container is labeled ""E, left pelvic lymph nodes ""and contains a
single fragment of yellow -tan lobulated fatty tissue measuring 4.5 x 1.8 x 1.8
cm. The specimen is subjected to chemical clearing with Carnoy' s solution

PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Bladder Cancer, H1O Prostate Cancer
MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
A-C: See final microscopic- diagnosis.,116 S
..: ^.6 s
olar-11 el
D: Sections of the bladder show extensive sheets of cells with high N/C ratio and prominent nuclei with nucleoli
forming papillary structures and extensively invading into muscularis propria involving the entire thickness of the
bladder wall (D5-8,1 1 ).The tumor extends into the perivesical fat and up to the posterior inked bladder wall
margin (D6). The adjacent mucosa shows multifocal areas of urothelial carcinoma in situ (D7). Multiple sections
of the bladder mucosa show cystitis cystica and cystitis glandularis (D7,9,13,16,17). A section from the urethra
shows residual periurethral prostatic tissue (D18). A section of benign seminal vesicle is also .identified (D20).
The tumor involves the entire posterior wall and extends laterally (predominantly left lateral )into the trigone and
anterior mucosal wall. A section of left ureter (D4) shows complete obstruction of the ureter with tumor. The
tumor also involves the right ureterovesical junction (D1). Multiple lymph nodes sampled show no evidence of
metastatic disease.

MACROSCOPY
2g of friable tissue chippings + blood clot.
MICROSCOPY
Sections show a poorly differentiated carcinoma with a solid growth pattern,
invading muscularis propria .Laminated layers of keratin, indicating squamous
differentiation ,are present .Large areas of necrosis are present. No
transitional urothelium has been identified but several strips of non-dysplastic
squamous epithelium are present .No vascular invasion identified.
The features are of a high grade carcinoma but it is not possible to determine
definitively whether this is transitional carcinoma showing squamous
differentiation or a primary squamous carcinoma.

Is (circle);Page 5 of 5"," Based on the pathology report, here is the information for each category:

Site: The primary tumor site is not explicitly mentioned in the report, but it appears to be a prostate based on the description of the specimens.

Laterality: Left and right sides are both affected, as indicated by the labeling of the specimens.

Histology: Adenocarcinoma is identified in the specimens labeled C1-C25.

Stage: Not provided in the report.

Grade: The grade of the tumor is not explicitly mentioned in the report, but it appears to be a high-grade malignancy based on the use of terms such as ""infiltrating"" and ""poorly differentiated.""

Behavior: Malignant behavior is indicated by the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma.

Justification for the choices: The primary tumor site is inferred from the labeling of the specimens, which indicate that they are taken from various parts of the prostate. Laterality is explicitly stated on some of the specimens. Histology, stage, grade, and behavior are determined based on the pathological findings reported in the document."

PATHOLOGIC TNM STAGE: BLADDER: pTis,Ta,T3bN2MX
PROSTATE: pT3aNOMX
COM MENT:Representative sections of invasive urothelial carcinoma are submitted for p53
assay by immunohistology, results of which will be issued in an addendum.
There are changes in the prostatic adenocarcinoma that suggest prior therapy
(radiation, hormone or both). And while the bulk of the carcinoma exhibits either
fused or separate but distinct malignant glands, there is a small component of
tumor characterized by individual infiltrating malignant cells. Finally, tumor is
focally seen in and around skeletal musclefibers in the proximal anterior
prostate, with no associated benign glandular tissue seen in the same area.
Although the capsule in this area is poorly defined or virtually nonexistent, the
changes are interpreted as representing prostatic adenocarcinoma outside the
prostate.

involved bladder wall measures 1 cm in thickness and the uninvolved bladder wall
measures 1.5 cm in thickness. The uninvolved bladder wall' s appearance is
hypertrophic. There are two diverticula identified, one in the right anterior wall
(opening 2 cm above right ureterovesical junction) and the other in the dome. The Page 3 of 4

INTRAOPERATIVE FROZEN CONSULTATION:AFS: Right distal ureter
-no high grade atypia or tumor identified
BFS: Left distal ureter
-no high grade atypia or tumor identified
MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:A-B:See final microscopic-diagnosis.
C:Sections of the bladder show a poorly differentiated invasive urothelial
carcinoma, grades 3 & 4/4 (C8-11), with a minor component exhibiting glandular
features. The tumor involves the full thickness of the bladder wall and penetrates
into the perivesical soft tissue (C9) with evidence of lyrnphovascular space
invasion (C11). All surgical margins are free of tumor. Focal urothelial
carcinoma in situ is present adjacent to invasive urothelial carcinoma (C10). The
ureters and bladder neck are free of tumor. No evidence of prostatic involvement
by urothelial carcinoma is seen
Sections of the prostate show bilateral, moderate to poorly differentiated
adenocarcinoma, Gleason's score7 (4+3), with a minor ( lessthan 5%) component of
Gleason's grade 5 tumor. The tumor is confined largely to the prostate but in one
site anteriorly in the left proximal prostate the tumor extends into extraprostatic
skeletal muscle (C23). No seminal vesicle involvement is identified. All surgical
margins are free of tumor."," Site: The specimen includes multiple sites such as the bladder, prostate, ureters, and lymph nodes.

Laterality: The tumor involves both right and left sides of the bladder, prostate, and ureters.

Histology: The histology is described as poorly differentiated invasive urothelial carcinoma in the bladder and moderate to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma in the prostate.

Stage: Based on the gross description of the tumor invading the full thickness of the bladder wall, extending into perivesical soft tissue, and involving lymphovascular spaces, it is likely to be at least stage T2 or higher. The presence of extraprostatic extension in the prostate also supports this staging.

Grade: The bladder tumor is described as grades 3 & 4/4, while the prostate tumor has a Gleason's score of 7 (4+3).

Behavior: Based on the histology and stage, the behavior of both tumors is likely to be malignant."

Laterality: The tumor primarily affects the right side of the bladder, ureter, and iliac lymph nodes, while the left ureter and iliac lymph node are also involved.

Histology: The histological diagnosis is a poorly differentiated invasive transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) in the bladder and high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN III) in the prostate.

Stage: The stage is not explicitly provided, but the description of the tumor invading the muscularis propria suggests at least muscle-invasive disease (≥T2).

Grade: The bladder tumor has a grade 4/4, indicating high-grade malignancy.

Behavior: The behavior of the tumors is malignant, with local invasion and potential metastasis to lymph nodes."

Clinical History:
The patient is ayear-old male with history of high-grade urothelial
carcinoma invasive into muscularis propria undergoing cystectomy and lymph node
dissection.
Specimens Received:
A: Right pelvic lymph node
B: Left pelvic lymph node
C: Bladder, vas deferens,
Gross Description:
The specimens are received in three containers each labeled with the patient's
name and medical record number.
A. The first container is additionally identified as, ""right pelvic lymph
node"". Received in formalin are multiple fragments of yellow, lobulated
fibroadipose tissue measuring 6.5 x 5 .8 x 2.4 cm in aggregate. Multiple rubbery lymph nodes are identified ranging from 0.3-5.5 cm in greatest dimension.
Representative sections of the specimen are submitted as follows:
A l : Multiple candidate lymph nodes
A2: One lymph node ,bisected
A3-A5: One lymph node ,trisected
A6-A 10: One lymph node
B. The second container is additionally identified as, ""left pelvic lymph
node"". Received in formalin are multiple fragments of yellow, lobulated
fibroadipose tissue measuring 7.5 x 5 x 1.9 cm in aggregate. Multiple rubbery
lymph nodes are identified ranging from 0.2-6 cm in greatest dimension.
Representative sections of the specimen are submitted as follows:
B 1: Multiple candidate lymph nodes
B2: 2 lymph nodes, bisected
B3: One lymph node bisected
B4-B5: One lymph node, bisected
B6-B9: One lymph node, sectioned
C. The third container is additionally identified as, ""bladder, vas deferens"".
Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 301.8 g, 16 x 10.5 x 3.6 cm
cystoprostatectomy specimen with attached mesenteric fat. The bladder measures
7.5 x 7 x 2.5 cm. The right ureteral stump measures 5 x 0.3 cm and the left 3 x
0.5 cm, and both demonstrate patent lumina. The prostate measures 4.2 x 3 x 2.9
cm. The right seminal vesicle measures 2.8 x 1.1 x 0.6 cm and the right vas
deferens 8 x 0.5 cm. Detached vessels are also present measuring 5.2 and 5.5 cm
in length by 0.3 cm in diameter The left seminal vesicle measures 2.4 x 1 x 0.5
cm and the left vas deferens 12 x 0.5 cm. Plastic tubing is present in the
bladder. There is disruption of the junction of the prostate and bladder along
the right side of the specimen. The urethral stump is flush with the prostate
apex. The right half of the prostate and bladder is inked blue and the left half
is inked black. The prostate is opened anteriorly along the urethra and
continued superiorly through the bladder in a Y-shaped incision. The prostate is
serially sectioned from apex to base to reveal an ill-defined, yellow-tan, firm
lesion measuring 1.8 x 0.9 x 0.6 cm in the right prostate measuring 0.1 cm from
the margin. The bladder demonstrates a tan, fungating, ulcerated 5.5 x 5.5 cm
mass involving the dome, right lateral wall, right half of the anterior wall and
some of the right posterior wall. The right ureteral orifice is involved by the
mass. Serial sectioning reveals ill-defined tumor invasion into the adipose
tissue to a depth of 1.4 cm, extending to 0.2 cm of the inked margin. The
remainder of the mucosa is tan-brown, edematous, and glistening with a uniform
0.2 cm wall thickness. The bilateral ureteral orifices are identified and probe
patent. The perivesicular fat is extensively dissected for lymph nodes, but none
are found. Representative sections are submitted as follows:
C l : Left ureteral margin
C2: Right ureteral margin
C3: Urethral and prostatic apical margin C4-C6: Representative prostate ,right half (with lesion)
C7-C9: Representative prostate ,left half

unoriented renal tissue measuring 0.8 x 0.6 x 0.3 cm. The specimen is totally submitted for frozen
section as Al.
B. Received fresh at the frozen desk is a specimen labeled ""left pelvic lymph node"" consisting of one
ovoid nodule measuring 1.5 x I x 0.5 cm. The specimen is totally submitted for frozen section as B1.
C. Received fresh at the frozen desk is a specimen labeled ""right distal ureter ""consisting of one piece
of unoriented luminal tissue measuring 0.7 x 0.7 x 0.3 cm. The specimen is totally submitted for frozen
section as Cl.
D. Received fresh at the frozen desk is a specimen labeled ""final urethral margin"" consisting of one
piece of unoriented tissue measuring 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm. The specimen is totally submitted for frozen
section in D1.
E. Received in formalin previously opened and inked with the margins taken is a specimen which
consists of a urinary bladder, bilateral ureters, prostate and attached seminal vesicles and vas deferens.
The bladder measures 13.0 x 9.0 x 5.5 cm. The external surface of the bladder is covered by a serosal
lining at the dome and fibroadipose tissue at the remaining portion. After the bladder is opened an
irregular, tan-white, firm area is identified measuring 3.5 x 3.0 cm. The mass appears to encompass the
entire trigone, the anterior, posterior, left bladder walls and both ureteral orifices. The mass is semisolid
with tan-brown to white, friable possible papillary areas. On sectioning, the mass appears to extend
through the left wall for a distance of 1.5 cm and is 0.2 cm from the soft tissue line of resection (inked
black). It does not appear to involve the perivesicular adipose tissue. Purulent material is present upon
sectioning of the left wall and left trigone. The remainder of the bladder wall appears edematous and
diffusely hemorrhagic. The hemorrhagic areas are predominantly visible on the posterior bladder wall. A
3.0 cm segment of right ureter is present. It is probe patent. Its mucosa is slightly inflamed and
granular. A 2.0 cm segment of left ureter is present. It Is probe patent and its mucosa is inflamed and
granular. The prostate measures 3.0 cm anteroposteriorly, 3.2 cm craniocaudally, and 4.0 cm
transversely. The capsular surface appears slightly roughened but complete. The gland is inked blue on
the right and yellow on the left, and sectioned from the apex to base transversely at 3 mm intervals
perpendicular to the urethra. The cross sections reveal a yellow-tan mottled cut surface. A definitive
mass is not identified. Rubbery nodularity is present. The seminal vesicles appear unremarkable.
Segments of vas deferens appear unremarkable. Sectioning of the attached fibroadipose tissue reveals
three tan-white firm nodules, resembling lymph nodes ranging in size from 0.3-0.6 cm in greatest
dimension. Representative sections are submitted In formalin as follows: El right distal ureter shave,
E2 left distal ureter shave, E3-E4 anterior bladder wall, E5 left wall to include deepest extent of lesion,
E6 left ureteral orifice, E7-E8 left trigone, E9 posterior wall demonstrating hemorrhagic mucosa, El 0

Page 4 of 4"," Site: The primary tumor site is located in the bladder, prostate, and Meckel's diverticulum. This conclusion is based on the description of the specimens from Parts A to D and G.

Laterality: The tumor involves both sides of the pelvic region, as indicated in Parts E (left pelvic lymph nodes) and F (right pelvic lymph nodes).

Histology: The type of cancer is not explicitly mentioned; however, it can be inferred that there might be different types of cancer in each specimen. A definitive histological diagnosis requires microscopic examination, which was performed but the specific results are not provided in this report.

Stage: The stage of the tumors is not provided in this report. Staging requires an assessment of the size and extent of the tumor(s), including any potential metastasis to lymph nodes or other organs. This information is not available from the gross examination alone.

Grade: The grade of the tumors, which indicates their differentiation level and aggressiveness, is not provided in this report. Grading requires microscopic evaluation of the tissue specimens.

Behavior: Based on the fact that malignant tumors are being removed and lymph nodes are being searched for metastasis, it can be assumed that these tumors have a malignant behavior; however, specific behavior information is not provided in this report."

The specimen is received fresh labeled ""bladder and prostate."" It consists
of an 8 x 7.5 x 5 cm bladder. There is 3 cm of attached right ureter. The
ureter appears dilated with a diameter of 0.6 cm. It is obstructed. The
ureteral margin (not a true margin) is sectioned and submitted en face.
There is 6 cm of attached left ureter. This ureter is patent and measures
0.4 cm in diameter. The ureteral (not a true margin) is sectioned and
submitted en face. The attached prostate measures 4 (r-I) x 2.9
(anterior-posterior) x 2.6 (apex-base) cm. The right seminal vesicle
measures 2 x 1.5 x 1 cm. The left seminal vesicle measures 2 x 1 x 0.7 cm.
The right vas deferens measures 8 cm in length and up to 0.4 cm in
diameter. The left vas deferens measures 5 cm in length and up to 0.2 cm in
diameter. The right half of the specimen is inked green, the left half
'inked blue and the posterior'aspect inked black.
The distal urethral margin is sectioned in a radial fashion and entirely
submitted for frozen labeled FS1 and FS2.
INTRAOPERATIVE PATHOLOGY CONSULTATION WITH FROZEN SECTION: ""Urethral margin
negative"" is rendered by
The specimen is opened along the anterior aspect. There is a 7 x 4.1 x 1 cm
partially endophytic, partially exophytic mass .The mass is found within
the trigone and extends up to a portion of the posterior wall, right
lateral wall and right aspect of the anterior wall. It extends to within
1.5 cm of the distal urethral margins. It appears to obstruct the right
ureteral orifice. It is found 1.3 cm from the left ureteral orifice. A
representative section of the tumor is sectioned and frozen for possible
ancillary studies. It is sectioned. It extends into the bladder wall for a
maximum depth of 2.1 cm. The bladder wall measures 2.2 cm and the tumor
extends to within 0.1 cm of the right lateral soft tissue margin. The cut
surface is tan and firm.
The remaining urothelium is moderately hyperemic and coarsely wrinkled. No
additional lesions are noted.
The prostate is serially sectioned. The cut surfaces are mottled tan-pink.
No obvious tumor is appreciated. The seminal vesicles are sectioned and are
grossly unremarkable. The vasa deferentia are sectioned revealing pinpoint
unremarkable lumina.
A gross photo is taken.
There are no palpable lymph nodes in the attached fat.

The examination of this case material and the preparation of this report were
performed by the staff pathologist.
Note:
The anterior wall mass is predominantly papillary without invasion. The
posterior wall mass is composed predominantly of a pseudosarcomatous
myofibroblastic proliferation that extends deep into the muscularis propria,
likely the result of the previous transurethral resection. Nests of atypical
cells are present deep in this myofibroblastic proliferation .In order to
confirm the epithelial nature of these cells and distinguish them from the
reactive process ,immunohistochemical staining is performed .Immunohistochemical
stains highlight numerous nests of invasive urothelial carcinoma cells, most of which were light microscopically inconspicuous (positive for p63 and cytokeratin
cocktail ).The tumor is negative for GATA3, which is relatively specific but not
entirely sensitive for urothelial carcinoma .Controls stain appropriately.
Multiple additional sections of this area are also examined, revealing similar
findings.

FSA: Right distal ureter:
Negative for malignancy.
FSB: Left distal ureter:
Negative for malignancy.

MICROSCOPY
A. Bladder, ovaries, uterus, fallopian tubes and cervix; Sections from the
macroscopically identified lesion confirm a poorly differentiated solid
urothelial carcinoma arising from surface carcinoma in situ and extending the
full thickness of the bladder wall to extend into the perivesicle fat.
The tumour invades with broad fronts and does not elicit a lymphocytic
infiltrate at the tumour host interface. Lymphovascular invasion is frequent.
There is occasional perineural invasion.
The tumour extends to within 4 mm of the circumferential surgical resection
margin. The background bladder wall is within morphologically normal limits.
The urethral surgical resection margin shows squamous metaplasia only. Bladder
wall also contains a mesonephric duct remnant.
The tumour cells themselves are markedly pleomorphic and have moderate amounts
of eosinophilic cytoplasm. There are numerous admixed giant cells some which
are osteoclastic type. They do not have trophoblastic differentiation. No
background sarcomatoid change or heterologous elements are noted.
The sections of the uterus and cervix confirm inactive endometrium, two
subserosal small leiomyomas, normal cervix and normal adenexae.
The nodule identified separately in the remnant fat away from the main specimen
is a lymph node with metastatic carcinoma with extracapsular extension.
B. Left external iliac node; A single lymph node with no evidence of metastatic
carcinoma.
C. Left obturator lymph node; Three lymph nodes, one with metastatic carcinoma.
The deposit measures 7 mm in maximum dimension and there is no extracapsular
extension.
D. Left common iliac node; A single lymph node with no evidence of metastatic
carcinoma.
E.Right external iliac node; A single node with metastatic carcinoma. The
deposit measures 10 mm and there is no extracapsular extension.
F.Right common iliac node; Two lymph nodes with no evidence of metastatic
carcinoma.
G. Right obturator node; Three lymph nodes, one with metastatic carcinoma. The
deposit measures 6 mm and there is extracapsular extension into the hilar soft
tissue.
H & [; This is ureteric tissue within normal limits.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:A-D:See final microscopic-diagnosis.
E:Sections of the urinary bladder showan invasive papillary transitional cellcarcinoma, high grade (4/4) ,characterized by a papillary
architecture of enlarged atypical ce.tis with correspondingly enlarge nuclei and
scant cytoplasm. The tumor involves the posterior wall of dome, left
ureterovesical junction, trigone and bladder neck. The tumor infiltrates through
the mu scularis propria into the perivesical fat but doesnot involve the resectionmargins. Perineural and lymphovascular invasion identified (E13,17).Also presentis urothelial carcinoma in situ involving the mucosa adjacent to the invasive
carcinoma.
Sectionsof the prostate show adenomatous hyperplasia with foci of high grade
prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN II), however no prostatic adenocarcinoma
is identified. The prostatic urethra is unremarkable. No invasive papillary
transitional cell carcinoma is identified.The bilateral seminal vesicles show nosignificant abnormalities.

A - Cystoprostatectomy specimen with bladder approximately 50 mm in
diameter ,attached adipose tissue 112 mm x 60 mm. Prostate measuring
35 mm supero -inferiorly x 45 mm lateral x 28 mm anterior -posterior.
Opened for research sampling.
The right side of the bladder has an indurated and ulcerated area
measuring 20 mm maximum with associated pale firm tumour extending
into adjacent adipose tissue and coming close to the anterior and
right surgical margin (blue ink). Elsewhere bladder mucosa appears
normal.
The prostate shows a minor degree of nodular hyperplasia.

MICROSCOPY
A - Bladder and prostate: Sections from the macroscopically
identified lesion confirm a poorly differentiated predominantly solid
urothelial carcinoma extending with discohesive clusters the entire
thickness of the bladder wall into the perivesical fat. The tumour
extends to less than 1 mm of the circumferential surgical resection
margin on the right side which is composed of compressed soft tissue.
There is no lymphocytic infiltrate at the tumour host interface.
Sections away from the main tumour mass contain foreign body-type
multinucleated giant cell aggregates in the lamina propria indicative
of site of previous biopsy.
Lymphovascular invasion is noted.
There is no perineural invasion.
The adjacent urothelium does not show evidence of dysplasia or
carcinoma in situ .There is tumour and ulceration.
Sections of the prostate confirm high grade PIN but there is no
evidence of microacinar adenocarcinoma. Some of the acinar structures
contain a chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate with an occasional
giant cell and is most likely to represent reaction to BCG. The
urothelium included does not show any evidence of dysplasia, carcinoma
in situ or a papillary urothelial carcinoma.
The urethral surgical margin is within morphologically normal limits.
B - Peri-bladder nodes: Two lymph nodes, both with metastatic
urothelial carcinoma. One node shows extracapsular extension.
C - Right external iliac node: One lymph node without metastatic carcinoma.
D - Right anterior obturator nodes: Two lymph nodes with florid sinus
hyperplasia. No metastatic carcinoma.
E - Right posterior obturator nodes: Two nodes without metastatic
carcinoma.
F - Left external iliac nodes: Two lymph nodes with sinus
hyperplasia. No metastatic carcinoma.
G - Left anterior obturator nodes :Two lymph nodes with no metastatic
carcinoma.
H - Left posterior obturator nodes: Two lymph nodes with no
metastatic carcinoma.
I - Left ureteric margin :This is morphologically normal ureter.
J - Right ureteric margin :This ismorphologically normal ureter.

*(INTEGRATED REPORT OF FINDINGS BY"," Based on the given information:

Site: The primary tumor site is not explicitly mentioned, but based on the test results, it appears to be related to reproductive or endocrine systems.

Laterality: Not provided

Histology: The histological type of the tumor is also not explicitly stated, but the presence of B/T cell markers and other tests suggest a possible hematologic malignancy or carcinoma.

Stage: Based on the clinical staging information provided, it appears to be an early-stage cancer (T2N0M0). However, without complete information, this cannot be confirmed.

Grade: Not provided

Behavior: The behavior of the tumor is not explicitly stated, but its malignant nature can be inferred from the context.

Justification for choice: The site and histology are inferred based on the test results and clinical information provided. The stage was determined using the TNM staging system. The other categories were not possible to determine due to insufficient or missing information."

name and medical record number.
A. The first container is additionally identified as, ""1. Right pelvic lymph
nodes "".Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 6 x 4 x 1 .5 cm yellow/brown
lobular aggregate of adipose tissue. Sectioning reveals multiple lymph node
candidates ranging from 0.2-2.7 cm. Sectioned candidate lymph node reveals
normal appearing cut surface .All candidate lymph nodes are submitted as
follows:
A I to A3: 5 candidate lymph nodes in each cassette
A4: 4 candidate lymph nodes
A5: 5 candidate lymph nodes
A6 to A8: 4 candidate lymph nodes in each cassette
A9: 2 candidate lymph nodes
A 10: 2 candidate lymph nodes
Al 1: One candidate lymph node bisected
A12: Section of remaining adipose tissue
B. The second container is additionally identified as, ""2. Left pelvic lymph
node"". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 6 x 3 x 0.5 cm yellow/brown
lobular aggregate of adipose tissue. Sectioning reveals multiple lymph node
candidates ranging from 0.2-4.5 cm. The largest candidate lymph node is sectioned to reveal normal appearing cut surface. All candidate lymph nodes are
submitted as follows:
B1 to B2: 3 candidate lymph nodes in each cassette
B3: 5 candidate lymph nodes
B4: 2 candidate lymph nodes
B5-B6: One candidate lymph node, section
B7: Section the remaining adipose tissue
C. The third container is additionally identified as, ""3. Prostate, vas
deferens"".
Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 375 g (post formalin fixation), 17 x
11.5 x 4.5 cm cystoprostatectomy specimen consisting of a 6 x 5 x 4 cm bladder
(post formalin fixation) with attached mesenteric fat and a 4.6 x 3.7 x 3.5 cm
prostate. The right seminal vesicle measure 3 x 1.8 x 0.7 cm and right vas
deferens measures 5.5 x 0.5 cm. The left seminal vesicle measures 3.5 x 1.1 x
0.4 cm and left vas deferens measures 4.5 x 0.5 cm. The right ureteral stump
measures 0.5 cm long x 0.4 cm diameter, the left measures 0.6 cm long x 0.4 cm
diameter, and both demonstrate intact, patent lumenina.
The right half of the prostate and bladder is inked blue and the left half is
inked black. The bladder and prostate are opened anteriorly along the urethra in
a Y-shaped incision. The prostate is surrounded by a thin, intact membranous
capsule and sectioning demonstrates rubbery, yellow-tan parenchyma with no
discrete masses or indurations. Sectioning of the seminal vesicles and vasa
deferentia reveal no gross lesion but there fairly extensive adhesion of the
left seminal vesicle and vas deferens to the prostate.
The opened bladder reveals a 3.3 x 2.7 cm yellow flat ulcerated lesion located
in right lateral wall extending to the dome and posterior wall associated with
extensive fibrosis on cut section. Grossly, the mass extends through the
muscularis propria and into the perivesicular fat but not to the inked margin
(approximately 0.5 cm from ink). The surrounding bladder mucosa is wrinkled,
pink-tan with a uniform 0.2 cm wall thickness. Bilateral ureteral orifices,
adjacent to the trigone, are identified and probe patent.
Representative sections are submitted as follows:
C 1: Distal prostatic urethral margin (apex)
C2: Right ureter resection margin
C3: Left ureter resection margin
C4: Prostate apex
C5 -C 16: Entire ulceration, from inferior to superior
C 17: Uninvolved bladder mucosa bladder dome
C18: Uninvolved bladder mucosa anterior wall
C 19: Uninvolved bladder mucosa posterior wall C20: Uninvolved bladder mucosa left lateral wall
C21-C23: Representative right lobe of prostate from apex to base
C24-C26: Representative left lobe of prostate submitted from apex to base
C27: Uninvolved bladder mucosa trigone
C28: Left seminal vesicle and vas deferens
C29: Right seminal vesicle and vas deferens
D. The fourth container is additionally identified as, ""4. Left distal
ureter-stitch non margin side "".
Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 1.5 cm segment of ureter with a
maximal diameter 0.4 cm (stitch side )and a patent lumen measuring 0.2 cm
(stitch side). The non-stitch end of the ureter is sectioned and submitted en
face in cassette D 1.

C. The third container is additionally identified as, ""Bladder/prostate"".
Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 19 x 10.5 x 4 cm cystoprostatectomy
specimen consisting of a 7.5 x 6.5 x 3 cm bladder with attached mesenteric fat
and a 4.6 x 3.4 x 3.2 cm prostate. The right seminal vesicles measure 2.5 x 1.2
x 0.5 cm and right vas deferens measures 4.5 x 0.2 cm. The left seminal
vesicles measures 2.5 x 1.3 x 0.2 cm and left vas deferens measures 3.9 x 0.2
cm. The right ureteral stump measures 0.4 cm in length by 0.2 cm in diameter,
the left measures 0.8 cm in length by 0.2 cm in diameter, and both demonstrate
intact, patent lumens.
The right half of the prostate is inked blue and the left half is inked black
and the remaining outer surface is inked black. The bladder and prostate are
opened anteriorly along the urethra. The prostate is surrounded by a thin, intact membranous capsule and sectioning demonstrates rubbery, pink-tan,
peri-urethral nodularity with no discrete masses or indurations.
The opened bladder reveals a 3.5 x 2.5 cm white-tan, firm ulcerated mass with a
rim of slightly raised red hemorrhagic tissue located in posterior-inferior wall
(trigone area). On cut section, the mass extends through the bladder serosa into
the perivesicular soft tissue to a depth of 1.7 cm and 0.1 cm the inked outer
surface. The surrounding bladder mucosa is edematous and wrinkled with a uniform
1.1 cm wall thickness. Bilateral ureteral orifices, adjacent to the trigone,
are involved by tumor and stenosed.

C. The third container is additionally identified as, ""bladder, prostate,
seminal vesicles and vas deferens"". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a
408.2 g, 19 x 5.5 x 3.5 cm specimen consisting of a 10 x 9 x 3 cm bladder with
an attached 3.8 x 2.9 x 2 cm prostate. The left ureter is 2 cm in length by 0.7
cm in diameter. The left ureter is not probe patent to the trigone. The right
ureter is 1.5 cm in length by 0.4 cm in diameter. The right ureter is probe
patent to the trigone. There is a 0.4 cm in length by 0.7 cm in diameter
urethral stump which is patent. The right seminal vesicle is 3.2 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm
and the right 5 is 9.5 cm in length by 0.3-0.5 cm in diameter. The left seminal
vesicle and left vase are matted together along the left posterior aspect of the
specimen and therefore cannot be measured. Also received are 2 detached vessels
measuring 5.5 cm and 8- cm in length by 03 cm in diameter. The specimen is inked
blue on the right and black on the left side of the prostate and the serous
serosal surface of the bladder is inked black. It is then opened anteriorly to
reveal a 4.7 x 4.5 cm indurated lesion which is tan-gray and ulcerated involving
the left posterior, trigone and left lateral wall. This area completely involves
and occludes the left ureter orifice. Gross photographs are taken. This lesion
is 3.9 cm from the distal ureter margin and 0.2 cm from the right ureter
orifice. The lesion is surrounded by hyperemic, erythematous mucosa. On the posterior wall there are 2 areas with grey -brown exudate adherent to the mucosa.
These areas measure 2 x 1.5 cm and 0 .7 x 0.6 cm .The remaining mucosa is
glistening, tan-pink and grossly unremarkable. The large lesion is serially
sectioned to reveal a firm white cut surface extending to a depth of 2.1 cm,
which surrounds the left seminal vesicle and vas and stretches the inked black
serosal surface. Serial sectioning of the prostate reveals gritty brown
material present within cystically dilated spaces involving the left side of the
prostate .Representative sections are submitted as follows:

[]M.D."," Site: Bladder and prostate
Laterality: Not provided
Histology: Based on the description of the indurated lesion, tan-gray appearance, and ulceration, the specimen is consistent with a malignant tumor, possibly urothelial carcinoma.
Stage: The tumor appears to invade the left seminal vesicle and vas deferens, and there is concern for lymph node metastasis. Therefore, the stage may be at least T3bN1M0 (AJCC 8th edition).
Grade: Not provided in the description.
Behavior: Malignant, as evidenced by the invasion of surrounding structures and potential for lymph node metastasis.

Justification: The site is identified as the bladder and prostate, with a large, indurated lesion present in the bladder. The lesion's appearance and involvement of the left ureter orifice suggest malignancy, likely urothelial carcinoma based on typical bladder cancer presentation. The stage is estimated based on the tumor's invasion into surrounding structures and potential lymph node metastasis. Grade is not provided in the description. The behavior of this lesion is malignant due to its aggressive characteristics, including invasion and possible metastasis."

COMMENTS:
Histologic sections confirm the presence of an invasive poorly differentiated urothelial carcinoma .The neoplasm shows full thickness invasion of the
bladder wall including full thickness of the muscu laris propria. The tumor does not definitely involve the perivesicle fibroadipose tissue .There is extensive
acute and chronic inflammation and foreign body giant cell reaction in areas of the perivesicle fibroadipose tissue .Given that tumor is not clearly identified
microscopically within the perivesicle tissue, the neoplasm is assigned an AJCC pathologic staging of T2b .This has been reviewed with Dr
is in agreement. I CLINICAL HISTORY:

Gross Description:
A. Received already fixed, inked, and opened labeled ""bladder and prostate"" is a specimen that
consists of urinary bladder, right ureter, prostate, attached seminal vesicles and vas deferens. The right
ureter is probed but there is no probe identifying the left ureter and the left ureter orifice in the trigone
area could not be seen or probed and after dissection a possible 3cm segment of left ureteris seen.The bladder measures 19 x 11 x 5 cm. The adhered surface of the bladder is covered by a smoothserosallining at the dome and fibroadipose tissue at the remaining portion. After the bladder is opened,
a mass measuring 5 x 4 x 1 cm is identified and is located on the anterior wall, right lateral wall, leftlateral wall, posterior wall and the trigone area .The mass is 4 cm from the right ureter margin, 3.5 cm
from the urethral margin, and 3.5 cm from the possible left ureter margin, and appears to invade 1 cmdeep.The mass is principally papillary. On sectioning, the mass extends to roughly 1 cm grossly into
the wall but does not grossly appear to go through the muscularis propria. It does not appear to involve
the perivesicular adipose tissue. The bladder mucosa is erythematousnear the urethra. A 4 cm
segment of right ureter and is patent, and the mucosa appears unremarkable. The left ureter was very
difficult to locate as there is no probe within it for fixation and the orfce in the trigone area could not be
Identified. A possible 3 cm segment of left ureter is identified after dissection. Its mucosa appears
unremarkable. The prostate measures 4 x 4 x 4 cm cranlocaudally, anteroposteriorly, and transversely.

Interpretation performed by the Attending Pathologist and reviewed with the
Resident/Fellow, [], MD, PhD
Electronically Signed Out by [] MD
Clinical History:
Patient is a year-old female clinical history of bladder cancer who undergoes
cystectomy, ileo conduit N. retroperitoneal lymph node dissection.
Specimens Received:
A: Bladder
B: Right pelvic lymph nodes
C: Left pelvic lymph nodes
D: Left distal uretheral margin
E: Right distal ureter
Gross Description:
The specimens are received in five containers each labeled with the patient's
name and medical record number.
A. The first container is additionally identified as, ""bladder"". Received fresh
and place in formalin is a 145.08 g cystectomy specimen with overall
measurements of 12.5 x 11.0 x 3.7 cm. The right ureteral stump measures 3 cm in
length and 0.4 cm in diameter, and the left measures 2.5 cm in length and 0.7 cm
in diameter, and both demonstrate intact patent lumens. The serosal surface
shows yellow, lobulated fibroadipose tissue with focal cautery artifact. There
is a 2.5 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm matted area on left posterior bladder held together by a
suture which is removed to reveal a 1.6 x 0.9 cm defect and a 4.0 x 3.5 cm area
of peritoneal discoloration on the right side adjacent to the dome. There is a
7.4 x 7.0 cm portion of tan-pink vaginal mucosa fixed on the posterior aspect of
the bladder. The urethral margin is inked black, and the bladder is inked blue
on the right half and black on the left half. The bladder measures 6.0 x 5.5 x
2.5 cm. The specimen is opened anteriorly to reveal a 2.5 x 1.7 cm red-tan,
hemorrhagic, friable, ulceration located in posterior wall within an ill-defined 4.1 x 3 cm area of induration. On cut section, the mass is white-tan,
indurated, and extends through the muscularis propria and pericystic adipose
tissue and abuts the deep surgical margin (i.e. 2.5 cm of 2.6 cm of the total
thickness of the specimen). Inferiorly, the induration also appears to abut the
vaginal wall. The surrounding bladder mucosa is wrinkled, congested, pink-tan
with a uniform 0.5-0.9 cm wall thickness. Bilateral ureteral orifices, adjacent
to the trigone, are identified and probe patent.
Representative sections are submitted as follows:
Al: Left ureter
A2: Right ureter
A3: Urethral margin
A4: Uninvolved bladder mucosa anterior wall
A5: Uninvolved bladder mucosa posterior wall
A6: Uninvolved bladder mucosa bladder dome
A7-A10: Bladder mass /Ulceration
A 11-A 13: Bladder mass abutting the vaginal wall
A 14 Fallopian tube
A15-A16 Ovary
B. The second container is additionally identified as, ""right pelvic lymph
nodes"". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 5.0 x 4.5 x 0.9 cm aggregate
of soft, rubbery, yellow-tan tissue fragments that are dissected for
approximately 10 lymph node candidates are submitted as follows
B 1: Two lymph node candidates
B2: One lymph node candidates, bisected
B3 B4: One lymph node candidates, bisected, one half in each cassette
B5: Five lymph node candidates
B6: One lymph node candidates, bisected
C. The third container is additionally identified as, ""left pelvic lymph
nodes"". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 4.0 x 3.5 x 1.1 cm aggregate
of soft, rubbery, yellow-tan tissue fragments that are dissected for
approximately 9 lymph node candidates are submitted as follows
C 1: Five lymph node candidates
C2: One lymph node candidates, bisected
C3: One lymph node candidates
C4: One lymph node candidates, bisected
C5-C6: One lymph node candidates, bisected, one half in each cassette
D. The fourth container is additionally identified as, ""left distal ureteral
margin stitch on margin side "". Received in formalin is a 2.3 cm in length by
0.9 cm in external diameter segment of ureter. There is a stitch on the
non-margin side. The serosal surface of the margin side is inked black. The
margin side of the ureter and a representative section are submitted in cassette
D1. E. The fifth container is additionally identified as, ""right distal ureter,
stitch on margin side"". Received in formalin is a 2.9 cm in length by 0.5 cm in
external diameter segment of ureter. The non-margin side is indicated with a
suture. The margin side is inked black and is submitted with a representative
section of the ureter in cassette El.

Page 6 of 6 END OF REPORT"," Site: Bladder, Uterus, Ovaries, Lymph Nodes, Ureters
Laterality: Right, Left, Not specified
Histology: Transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder, Leiomyoma of the uterus, Normal ovarian tissue, Reactive lymph nodes
Stage: Not provided (requires additional information such as depth of invasion and presence of metastasis)
Grade: High grade for transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder (based on description of ulcerated lesion with invasive growth)
Behavior: Malignant (transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder), Benign (leiomyoma of the uterus), Unremarkable (normal ovarian tissue and reactive lymph nodes)

Justification: The transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder is malignant and high grade based on the description of an ulcerated lesion with invasive growth. The leiomyoma of the uterus is benign as it is a common, non-cancerous tumor. The ovarian tissue and reactive lymph nodes are unremarkable, which means they appear normal or show no signs of malignancy.

C:Sections of the apical urethral margin show benign urethral and periurethral
tissue with chronic inflammation. A separate detached fragment (floater) of tumor
is seen in the lumen in the permanent sections only. It is not associated with the
urethral mucosa or stroma. Page 6 of 6
D:Sections of the bladder show poorly differentiated urothelial carcinoma
(D9,10,12), involving the left lateral wall and invading the superficial muscularis
propria (D10,12). Individual tumor cells range from moderate to markedly
pleomorphic, corresponding to grades 3 & 4/4. Urothelial carcinoma in situ (flat
lesion) is seen in the adjacent mucosa (D1o,12,13) with a focus of moderate to
severedysplasia involving the left UVJ. No perineural or lymphovascular
invasion is identified. Sections of the non-neoplastic bladder mucosa show
multifocal chronic inflammation with cystitis cystica and glandularis. Resections
margins are free of urothelial dysplasia and malignancy. No lymph nodes or tumor
is seen in the perivesical fat. Sections that include the distal prostatic urethra
(D16) show a detached fragment of urothelial carcinoma in the urethral lumen,
consistent with contaminant, similar to that described in specimen C above.

Justification: The report mentions the location of the primary tumor but does not specify whether it is the bladder or urethra.

Laterality: Not provided
Justification: The report does not mention the laterality of the tumor.

Histology: Urothelial carcinoma
Justification: The report mentions urothelial carcinoma in situ and foci of low-grade and high-grade urothelial carcinoma.

Stage: pT1a (T stage not explicitly mentioned, but the tumor is invasive)
Justification: The report mentions that there are foci of invasive urothelial carcinoma, but the depth of invasion is not specified. Therefore, we assume it to be organ-confined and assign a T1 stage. Since all surgical margins are free of invasive carcinoma, we assign an ""a"" designation for N0/Mx.

DIAGNOSIS:
A. Soft tissue (excision):
High -grade urothelial carcinoma ,present within adventitia of vein.
B. Bladder ,uterus ,fallopian tubes and ovaries (resection):
High-grade urothelial carcinoma of the bladder with striking discohesive growth pattern , (7.0 cm).
Immunohistochemistry performed at demonstrates the following staining profile in
tumor cells:
Positive -CK7, CK903,mCEA
Negative -CK2O ,p63, p53 ,ER, E-Cadherin
Mucicarmine stain highlights presence of mucin within Intracytoplasmic vacuoles.
The carcinoma diffusely infiltrates the full thickness of the bladder ,extending into the perivesical fat,
endomyometrium and cervix ,extending to bilateral ovaries and fallopian tubes.
Tumor is present at the anterior and posterior surgical resection margins of bladder ,and at the

Note :7(-Z.3 CL.-?.U
The tumor is composed of poorly differentiated rather small cells with discohesive growth pattern, intracytoplasmic
lumina and increased mitoses .This morphology mimicks that of lobular carcinoma of the breast ,and the growth
pattern is similar to that seen in poorly -differentiated adenocarcinoma of the stomach ,diffuse-type.
The immunoprofile supports the urothelial origin in this case .In addition ,conventional high-grade papillary urothelial
carcinoma was identified in the TURB specimen i Jo residual typical urothelial cell carcinoma was
identified in sections of the current specimen.
Given the growth pattern of this tumor ,its presence in the ovaries and fallopian tubes is interpreted as local spread
from primary site ,rather than metastatic disease.
Pagel of 2 rota elial carcinoma with discohesive growth pattern mimicking lobular carcinoma of breast have been viously
reported.
Reference: Transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder mimicking lobular carcinoma of the
breast: a discohesive variant of urothelial carcinoma.
Clinical correlation is recommended.

END OF REPORT Page 2 of 2"," Site: Bladder (based on the description of the tumor's location in the bladder and its extension into the perivesical fat, as well as the mention of a cystectomy specimen)

Laterality: Not provided (the report does not specify whether the tumor is located in one or both sides of the bladder)

Histology: Transitional cell carcinoma (this term is used in the gross description and the immunoprofile supports urothelial origin)

Stage: The TNM pathological stage is not provided, but based on the gross description, it appears that the tumor has invaded the perivesical fat, suggesting at least pT3 disease.

The patient is a -year-old male with bladder cancer undergoing radical
cystectomy, bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection, ileal conduit.
Specimens Received:
A: Right pelvic lymph node
B: Left pelvic lymph node
C: Bladder, prostate ,vas deferens; cystoprostatectomy
Gross Description:
The specimens are received in three containers each labeled with the patient's
name and medical record number.
A. The first container is additionally identified as, ""right pelvic lymph
node"". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 6 .5 x 5.0 x 1.8 cm aggregate
of lobulated yellow fibrofatty tissue .The specimen is dissected for lymph
nodes to reveal 9 apparent lymph nodes ranging from 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.1 to 6.1 x 1.1
x 1.0 cm in greatest dimension .All apparent lymph nodes are submitted as
follows:
Al-A2: 5lymph node candidates
A3: One lymph node, bisected
A4: One lymph node, bisected
A5: One lymph node, bisected
A6-A7 : One lymph node ,sectioned
B. The second container is additionally identified as, ""left pelvic lymph
node"". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 6.7 x 4.5 x 2.0 cm aggregate
of lobulated yellow fibrofatty tissue .The specimen is dissected for lymph
nodes to reveal 8 apparent lymph nodes ranging from 0.5 x 0.2 x 0.1 to 2.7 x 1.5
x 0.8 cm in greatest dimension. All apparent lymph nodes are submitted as
follows:
B1:
B2:
B3:
B4:
B5:
B6-B7:3 lymph node candidates
One lymph node, bisected
One lymph node, bisected
One lymph node, bisected
One lymph node, bisected
One lymph node, sectioned
C. The third container is additionally identified as, ""bladder, prostate, vas
deferens"". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 396.8 gm, 15.0 x 12.0 x
4.5 cm cystoprostatectomy specimen with attached mesenteric fat. The bladder
measures 9.5 x 8.0 x 4.0 cm. The bilateral ureteral orifices are identified and
probe patent. The right ureteral stump measures 4.5 x 0.4 cm and the left 4.5 x
0.5 cm, and both demonstrate patent lumina. The prostate measures 4.5 x 4.0 x
3.5 cm. The right half of the prostate and bladder is inked blue and the left
half is inked black. The prostate is opened anteriorly along the urethra and
continued superiorly through the bladder in a Y-shaped incision. The prostate is
serially sectioned from apex to base to reveal unremarkable, bulging yellow-tan
parenchyma without indurations; there is periurethral nodularity. The bladder
demonstrates an area of ulceration with underlying induration on the right
posterolateral wall that measures 5.0 x 3.0 cm. The mucosal surface overlying
this induration has a flattened, granular appearance. Serial sectioning reveals tumor invasion to within 0.2 cm of the inked margin, and grossly apparent
invasion into the muscularis propria. Adjacent to this area of ulceration and
induration, toward the left posterolateral wall, there is a poorly defined area
of mucosa with a granular appearance without prominent papillary excrescences;
the tissue underlying this granular mucosa is somewhat indurated .The remainder
of the mucosa is tan -brown ,edematous ,and glistening with a uniform 2.5 cm wall
thickness. The external surface of the bladder is red-tan and glistening with no
grossly identifiable lymph nodes .Representative sections are submitted as
follows:
C l : Distal urethral margin
C2: Prostatic apical margin
C3: Right ureteral margin
C4: Left ureteral margin
C5: Right ureteral orifice
C6: Left ureteral orifice
C7-C12 : Multiple tumor sections ,including deepest invasion in C 12
C13: Representative section from adjacent ,granular mucosa
C14-C22: Representative sections of prostate from apex to base
C23: Seminal vessels and vasa deferentia
C24: Uninvolved dome
C25: Uninvolved anterior wall
C26: Uninvolved posterior wall
C27: Uninvolved right wall
C28: Uninvolved left wall
Gross photograph was taken of a representative section of the ulcerated,
indurated region.

[]M.D."," Site: Bladder
Justification: Specimen C is identified as bladder, prostate, vas deferens and describes an area of ulceration with underlying induration on the right posterolateral wall.

Laterality: Right
Justification: The description of specimen C mentions an area of ulceration with underlying induration on the right posterolateral wall.

Histology: Urothelial carcinoma
Justification: Although not explicitly stated, this is the most common type of bladder cancer and the description of specimen C is consistent with the presence of a malignant tumor.

Stage: Not provided
Justification: The gross description does mention that there is tumor invasion to within 0.2 cm of the inked margin, and grossly apparent invasion into the muscularis propria but the staging would require additional information such as the depth of invasion and presence of metastasis which is not provided in this description.

Grade: Not provided
Justification: The grade of the tumor is not mentioned in the given description. Grade refers to how abnormal the cancer cells look under a microscope and how quickly the cancer is likely to grow and spread.

Behavior: Malignant
Justification: The description of specimen C is consistent with a malignant tumor, as it mentions ulceration, induration, and invasion into the muscularis propria."

Clinical History:
Patient is a -year-old male with malignant neoplasm of the bladder, undergoing
a cystoprostatectomy with ileo-conduit surgery.
Specimens Received:
A: Left pelvic lymph node
B: Right pelvic lymph node
C: Bladder, prostate, seminal vesicles, vas deferens
Gross Description:
The specimens are received in three containers each labeled with the patient's
name and medical record number.
A. The first- container is additionally identified as, ""left pelvic lymph node"".
Received fresh and placed in formalin are multiple, irregular, fibrofatty, soft
tissue fragments aggregating to a total of 7.5 x 4 x I cm. Ten lymph node
candidates are dissected from the specimen ranging in size from 0.3 cm to 2.5
cm. Lymph node candidates are entirely submitted as follows
A 1: 5 lymph node candidates
A2: One lymph node, bisected
A3: One lymph node, bisected A4: One lymph node, bisected
A5-A6: One lymph node, serially sectioned
B. The second container is additionally identified as, ""right pelvic lymph
node"". Received fresh and placed in formalin are multiple, irregular,
fibrofatty, soft tissue fragments aggregating to a total of 6 x 3.5 x 1 cm. Six
lymph node candidates are dissected from the specimen ranging in size from 0.4
cm to 2.3 cm. Lymph node candidates are submitted entirely as follows
B 1: One lymph node, bisected
B2: One lymph node, serially sectioned
B3: One lymph node, bisected
B4: One lymph node, bisected
B5: 2 possible lymph node candidates
C. The third container is additionally identified as, ""Bladder, prostate and
seminal vesicles"". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 292.2 g, 17 x 12.5
x 3.4 cm cystoprostatectomy specimen consisting of a 7 x 6 x 2 cm bladder with
attached mesenteric fat and a 4.5 x 3.8 x 3.5 cm prostate. The right seminal
vesicles measure 2.7 x 1.2 x 0.8 cm and right vas deferens measures 8 cm in
length and 0 .5 cm in diameter .The left seminal vesicles measures 3 x 1.5 x 0.6
cm and left vas deferens measures 10.5 cm in length and 0.3 cm in diameter. The
right ureteral stump measures 1.3 cm, the left measures 1.7 cm, and both
demonstrate intact, patent lumens.
The right half of the prostate and bladder is inked blue and the left half is
inked black. The bladder and prostate are opened anteriorly along the urethra.
The prostate is received with severe disruptions at the apex but it 's surrounded
by a thin ,intact membranous capsule .Sectioning demonstrates rubbery, pink-tan,
peri-urethral nodularity with no discrete masses or indurations.
The opened bladder reveals a 2.2 x 2 x 1 cm polypoidal, firm, and white mass,
located in the dome of the bladder. On cut section, the mass does not extend
into the muscularis propria and measures 2.1 cm from the deep margin of
resection. A 3.5 x 2.5 x 2 diverticulum is noted on the left lateral wall. The
wall of diverticulum is 0.3 cm and is lined by pink-tan, attenuated, bladder
mucosa with no mass lesions or ulcerations. The remainder of the bladder mucosa
iswrinkled, pink-tan with a uniform 0.4 cm wall thickness. Bilateral ureteral
orifices, adjacent to the trigone, are identified and probe patent. Specimen
photographs are taken.
Representative sections are submitted as follows:
C 1: Right ureter resection margin
C2: Left ureter resection margin
C3: Distal prostatic urethral margin
C4: Prostatic apical margin
C5-C6: Full-thickness section of the tumor ( at maximum depth), bisected C7-C9: Remaining tumor, submitted entirely.

Laterality: Left, Right
Histology: Urothelial carcinoma
Stage: High-grade muscle invasive (T2-T4), based on extensive tumor size, depth of invasion, and involvement of adjacent adipose tissue.
Grade: Not provided in the description.
Behavior: Malignant, as indicated by the invasive growth pattern and the need for transurethral resection.
Justification: The tumor's large size, deep invasion into the bladder wall, necrosis, and extension into perivesical adipose tissue suggest a high-grade malignancy with muscle invasion, which is consistent with urothelial carcinoma. The laterality of the tumors on both sides of the bladder also supports this diagnosis."

MACROSCOPY
A cystoprostatectomy specimen comprising bladder (measuring 78 mm supero-
inferiorly x 68 mm transversely x 62mm antero-posteriorly), prostate (measuring 38
mm supero-inferiorly x 54 mm transversely x-45 mm antero'-
posteriorly), perivescular fat up to 45 mm in depth and right and left ureteric stumps
each approx. 35 mm long.
On opening the bladder, there is a tumour on the left lateral wall extending onto the
dome measuring 42 mm
maximum dimension and 18 mm maximum depth. The extent of invasion cannot he
ascertained. The distance to
left pelvic surgical resection margin is approximately 12 mm. The background
bladder mucosa appears normal.
The prostate shows some nodularity. A lymph node measuring 20 mm in maximum
dimension is located deep to the tumour.

MICROSCOPY
Please note
The following report includes the findings from the resection margins and lymph
nodes processed as
Tl» tumour in the bladder is a poorly differentiated (Grade 3) urothelial carcinoma. It
arises from the surface and
invades through muscle to reach just beyond the muscularis propria into the
extravesical fat. No unequivocal evidence of lymphovascular invasion is seen. The background bladder urothelium
shows a focus of cystitis
cystica.but no metaplasia, dysplasia or intraepithelial neoplasia.
The left and right ureteric resection margins show no evidence of tumour and are
lined by normal urothelium. The
urethral resection margin is free of tumour.
The closest peripheral surgical margin lies 11 mm on the left.
The left prostate gland contains-extensive prostatic microacinar adenocarcinoma,
extending from the apex to
the middte of the gland. A small focus is present in the right apex. There is perineural
involvement within the
capsule but no evidence of extracapsular tumour. The prostatic adenocarcinoma has
been fully excised with no
evidence of tumour at intraprostatic or extraprostatic surgical resection margins. The
urethral resection margin
shows no prostatic or urothelial carcinoma.
A total of 21 lymph nodes have been identified (3 x perivesical; I x right ext. iliac; 1
x left obturator; 2 x left ext.
iliac; 5 x left int. iliac; 3 x right int. iliac; 0 x left common iliac). none of which
contain metastatic urothelial
carcinoma. However, two nodes show metastatic prostatic adenocarcinoma (1 out of 3
perivesical, near
right ureter; I out of 5 left int. iliac).

MACROSCOPY
1.Specimen consists of bladder (160 x 65 x 37mm), prostate and peri-vesical
fat, entire specimen measuring 125 x 120 x 45mm. The right lateral wall contains
an ulcerated tumour (22mm maximum dimension) which appears to extend to the full
thickness of the wall to reach the fat. The lesion is within 2mm of the
circumferential surgical resection margin. The prostate appears macroscopically
normal. No lymph nodes are identified in the fat.
2. Lymph node measuring 26 x 8 x 5mm.
3. The specimen consists of fragmented nodal tissue measuring 40 x 20 x 8mm plus
fat.
4. Fatty tissue measuring 55 x 50 x 10mm containing 3 nodes, the largest 23mm
maximum dimension.
5. Fatty tissue measuring 60 x 50 x 15mm. The largest node measures 25mm in

7. Cylindrical piece of tissue 23mm in length x up to 4mm diameter.
8. Piece of tissue 15 x 5 x 3mm.
9. Cylindrical piece of tissue 15mm in length x 3mm diameter.
MICROSCOPY
1. Sections taken from the macroscopically identified tumour show a poorly
differentiated transitional cell carcinoma with a significant lipoid cell
component, extending through the bladder wall to reach the perivesicle fat.
Areas of necrosis are noted. Extensive perineural invasion is seen. There is
some possible lymphovascular invasion.
The tumour host interface contains only a sparse lymphocytic infiltrate.
The overlying epithelium is largely denuded, but where present, is
morphologically normal with no evidence of dysplasia or carcinoma in situ.in
Random sections from the rest of the bladder wall shows morphologically normal
urothelium.
The sections from both lobes of the prostate are morphologically normal.
The prostatic urethral resection margin shows no evidence of tumour or
dysplasia.
2.External iliac right; Reactive lymph node with no evidence of metastatic
carcinoma. 3.Right internal iliac; A reactive lymph node with no evidence of metastatic
carcinoma.
4.Right obturator node; Three reactive nodes with no evidence of metastatic
carcinoma.
5.Left obturator node and internal iliac; Nine reactive nodes with no evidence
of metastatic carcinoma.
6.Right para rectal lymph node; A lymph node with no evidence of metastatic
carcinoma.
7.Right internal iliac artery; Sections confirm a muscular artery with medial
degeneration and dystrophic calcification. There is no evidence of carcinoma.
8.Left ureteric resection; All the tissue was processed and shows ureteric
tissue largely denuded of urothelium. There is no evidence of invasive
transitional cell carcinoma.
9.Right ureteric resection margin; Ureteric tissue denuded of urothelium but
with surface ulceration lined by granulation tissue. The lamina propria is
oedematous and congested with a moderate chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate.
There is no evidence of urothelial carcinoma.

2. ""Laterality"": Not provided. Justification: There is no mention of laterality in the report, as it could be a non-lateralized organ or information not applicable.
3. ""Histology"": Transitional cell carcinoma. Justification: The 'Formatted Path Reports' section mentions ""Histologic type: Transitional cell carcinoma"".
4. ""Stage"": Not provided. Justification: The report does not contain enough information to determine the TNM stage, as it lacks details on tumor invasion into surrounding structures, lymph node involvement, and metastasis.
5. ""Grade"": Poorly differentiated. Justification: The 'Formatted Path Reports' section states ""Histologic grade: Poorly differentiated"".
6. ""Behavior"": Malignant. Justification: This is inferred from the diagnosis stating ""Infiltrating urothelial carcinoma"", which implies invasion into surrounding tissues, and the generally aggressive nature of transitional cell carcinomas."

Immunohistochemical stains for synaptophysin, chromogranin and pancytokeratin on D9
show the neoplastic cell in the bladder are positive for pancytokeratin and
vimentin, and negative for synaptophysin and chromogranin, which support the
diagnosis of urothelial carcinoma with sarcomatoid features. Immunostains for CK
903and racemase on 19 and D22 support the diagnoses of prostatic adenocarcinoma.

the entire specimen is inked black, with the right side inked with, superimposed
red.The specimen is opened along the anterior urethra revealing a prostatic
urethra measuring 3 cm in length x 3 cm in circumference. The verumontanum
measures 1.3 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm. The urethral mucosa is pink-tan, smooth, and does-not
appear to be excavated. The bladder is almost entirely filled by huge, necrotic,
bloody, friable, soft, exophytic mass which measures 14.5 x 8 x 5 cm. The mass
appears to arise from the left lateral wall. Upon sectioning through the mass, the
cut surfaces are coagulative, solid, soft and ranges in color from red to yellowish
in a marbled pattern. Upon sectioning through the mass's relationship to the left
lateral wall, it appears to arise from the solid, firm, light tan mass at the base
and to extend into the bladder wall but not involve the underlying perivesical fat.
The tumor appears to be 1 cm from the inked black margin. Bilateral attached
ureters are opened. The right ureter measures 6 cm in length x 1.2 cm in
circumference and the left ureter measures 7.3 cm in length x 1.1 cm in
circumference. The ureteral mucosa are both grossly unremarkable. The remaining
bladder mucosa is gray, congested, and grossly unremarkable elsewhere, except for
the trigone where there is a firm nodularity. The specimen is taken to the O.R. in
a gross consultation. The urothelium is fixed in B5 fixative for an hour and the
specimen is subsequently entirely fixed in formalin. The prostate is serially
sectioned from distal to proximal, revealing smooth, solid, grossly unremarkable, Page 4 of 6

1. The specimen is received fresh labeled, "" Bladder, uterus , cervix, urethra, bilateral tubes and ovaries , anterior vaginal wall,
perivesical lymph nodes"". It consists of a cystohysterectomy with bilateral salpingo -oophorectomy specimen measuring 20 cm
from superior to inferior, 10 cm laterally and 5.0 cm from anterior to posterior. The uterus measures 6.5 cm superior to inferior, 5.5
cm from cornu to cornu, and 3.0 from anterior to posterior. There is a subserosal calcified nodule at the fundus of the uterus
measuring 1.1 cm in greatest dimension. The right ovary measures 2.3 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm. There is an adherent clear thin walled cyst
measuring 4.2 x 3.8 x 2.5 cm. The right fallopian tube measures 7 cm in length with a normal fimbriated end and a pinpoint lumen.
Page 2 of 5 SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT
The left ovary measures 2.5 x 1.8 x 1.5 cm. The left fallopian tube measures 7.5 cm in length with a normal fimbriated end and a
pinpoint lumen. The right aspect of the bladder is inked green and the left aspect of bladder is inked blue. The uterus is inked
black posteriorly. The cervix measures 2 cm in length . The ectocervix measures 4.5 cm in diameter . The bladder is opened along
the anterior midline to reveal an oval ,ulcerated ,fungating lesion measuring 2.0 x 1.5 cm in the trigone area and the posterior wall.
The lesion appears to be involving the both ureteral orifices. Both ureters are probed and appear blocked. The lesion is sectioned
and revealed that the lesion is invading deeply into the muscularis layer .Extension to the inked fat is grossly not identified. The
remaining bladder mucosa is pink and edematous .Discrete perivesical lymph nodes are grossly not identified. The entire lesion is
submitted and the representative sections from the rest of the bladder are submitted . TPS is submitted . Photographs are taken.

Clinical History
The patient is an year-old man with a history of high-grade urothelial carcinoma
involving the left ateral wall. He now undergoes a radical cystoprostatectomy with bilateral lymph node
dissection.
Gross Description
The specimen is received in nine parts, each labeled with the patient's name and unit number. Parts
A-C are received fresh. Parts D-I are received in formalin.
Part A. additionally labeled ""left ureter,"" consists of one, soft, pink, ovoid, irregular unoriented tissue
fragment (0.8 x 0.8 x 0.3 cm). The entire specimen is frozen for frozen section diagnosis 1, and
Page 2of4 subsequently submitted in cassette Al.
Part B, additionally labeled ""right ureter ,""consists of one, soft ,pink, irregular, unoriented tissue
fragment (1.7 x 0 .4 x 0.3 cm). The entire intact specimen is frozen for frozen section diagnosis 2, and

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:A-D:see final microscopic-diagnosis.
D:Sections corresponding to the tumor in the posterior bladder wall show a deeply
invasive poorly differentiated transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder measuring
3.5 x 3.5 x 1.8 cm. The tumor infiltrates the lamina propria and muscularis
propria and into the superficial perivesical fat. The neoplastic cells invade as
nests, cords, sheets and as single cells. They have high nuclear to cytoplasmic
ratios, hyperchromatic pleomorphic nuclei and prominent nucleoli. Multifocal
lymphovascular invasion identified. The tumor involves the posterior wall and
extends into the trigone and bladder neck distally and extends bilaterally to Page 6 of 6

involve the ureterovesical junctions (E3,8-14, 27-29). Multifocal urothelial
carcinoma in situ is also noted (E1-7) with invasion of the lamina propria
(E3,4,7). Sections of the tumor adjacent to the left seminal vesicle shows tumor
in the perivesical fat but not involving the seminal vesicle. Sections that
include the bladder neck show invasive tumor extending near but not involve
prostatic tissue. Resection margins are free of urothelial dysplasia and
malignancy.
Sections of the prostate show a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma (E19),
involving the right mid anterior prostate, Gleason' s score 6 (3+3). The tumor is
characterized by single variably shaped and sized malignant glands that infiltrate
the stroma in a random fashion. The neoplastic cells are medium to large with high
nuclear to cytoplasmic ratios, vesicular chromatin and prominent nucleoli. The
prostatic capsule, periprostatic soft tissue and inked capsular margins are free of
tumor. The bilateral seminal vesicles are free of tumor. No perineural invasion
is identified. The non-neoplastic prostate shows benign prostatic hyperplasia with
rare foci of high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN II). The
prostatic urethra is free of urothelial dysplasia and the prostatic itself shows no
evidence of invasive urothelial carcinoma.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:A-C:See final microscopic- diagnoses.
D:Sections of the bladder tumor shows poorly differentiated malignant urothelial
cells invading the entirely thickness of the muscularis propria into perivesical
fat (1)4, 7 and 13-21). There are multiple foci of lymphovascular space invasion
identified (D16). The malignant cells are arranged in large sheets and nests. Page 6 of 6
Many cells show large, pleomorphic-, irregular nuclei. Malignant cells have enlarged
nuclei with vesicular chromatin, prominent nucleoli and abundant pink or clear
cytoplasm. A small focus of urothelial carcinoma in-situ (flat lesion) is
identified (D11). Random urothelial mucosa remote from the tumor site shows
multilayering of benign urothelium and sporadic reactive changes .The radial inked
margin is free of tumor with the carcinoma coming within 1.2 cm from the closest
inked margin (D16) in the left posterolateral perivesical soft tissue. Remaining
margins, including ureteral margins, are more widely free of malignancy.
Sections of the adjacent prostate showa small focus of well-differentiated
invasive adenocarcinoma of the prostate in the right posterior midprostate (D27),
multiple scattered nodules of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Scattered foci of
high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia are identified.

CLINICAL DETAILS
Cystectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for bladder cancer.
MACROSCOPY
Cystectomy specimen measuring 120 x 80 x 50mm with attached cuff of vagina and
tubes and ovaries. There is a polypoid and partly ulcerated tumour in the
posterior wall of the bladder and extending to the fundus, measuring 60 x 55 x
20mm. The tumour infiltrates the bladder wall, extending to the outer half of
the muscle and almost reaches close to the posterior serosal surface. The
serosal surface appears slightly nodular and congested. The attached right ovary
measures 20 x 25 x 5mm and the fallopian tube measures 30 x 5mm. The left ovary
measures 30 x 15 x 5mm and the left fallopian tube measures 40 x 5mm. The cuff
of vagina measures 20 x 20 x 7mm is seen attached.
MICROSCOPY p
The bladder shows solid grade 3 transitional cell carcinoma with extensive3 /O "">
squamous differentiation. The tumour infiltrates full thickness of the muscle
and extends focally into perivesical fat. No lymphovascular invasion is noted.
There is focal necrosis within the tumour. The background urothelium shows
possible dysplasia in some areas, no carcinoma in situ is seen.
The attached fallopian tubes, ovaries and the vaginal cuff are within normal
histological limits.
4 lymph nodes were dissected out from the perivesical fat, one of which shows
metastatic tumour deposit. (Please see also report number
accompanying lymph node dissection).

3) The specimen is received fresh, labeled ""Bladder and
Prostate"". It consists of a 24 x 14 x 5.8 cm cystoprostatectomy
specimen with attached overlying adipose tissue. The left half
of the prostate is inked blue and the right half is inked green.
In the left half of the bladder there is a palpable tumor mass
which appears to occupy the left lateral and anterior wall. The
overlying adipose in this area is inked black. There is
approximately 3 cm in length of ureter on the left and 4.5 cm of
ureter on the right. Both ureters are probe patent. The
specimen is opened along the anterior wall to reveal a 7.5 X 6.8
X 3.3 cm, fungating, ulcerated tumor mass occupying the central
and lateral left posterior bladder wall as well as the anterior
bladder wall. The tumor is left lateral and anterior and is
adjacent to, but not occluding, the left ureteral orifice within
the bladder. The uninvolved bladder mucosa is hemorrhagic and
rugose. The trigone is not grossly involved by tumor. Serial
sectioning of the tumor reveals the cut surfaces are yellow-white
and necrotic. The tumor invades the muscularis mucosa, however,
Page 2 of 5 SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT
it does not appear to extend through it into the overlying soft
tissue. Representative sections of tumor and bladder mucosa are
submitted. The entire prostate is submitted from anterior to
posterior and designated A through H respectively. The specimen
is photographed and portions of tumor are submitted to TPS.

SPECIMEN
A. Right side lymph node
B. Right ureteric resection margin
C. Bladder and prostate
CLINICAL DETAILS
Invasive bladder cancer.
MACROSCOPY
A. Fat and lymph node measuring 45 x 20 x
1-3 = ?One lymph node in each
B. A piece of tube measuring 3 mm.15 mm.
C. Bladder and prostate measuring 130 x 80 x 60 mm. There is a hugh tumour
occupying most of the bladder wall. The tumour is centred posterior and extends
bilaterally to the lateral wall. The tumour invades through the bladder wall
with extensive peritoneal involvement. The tumour is within 1 mm of the left
lateral circumferential resection margin (closest). There is a massive tumour
superior bulging into the peritoneum. The maximum tumour dimension is 130 mm.
The tumour abuts the prostate but does not appear to involve the prostate.
The prostate shows a minor degree of nodular hyperplasia.

MICROSCOPY
A. One lymph node with reactive changes and no tumour; most of the sample is
fat.
B. This sample of ureter does not have any visible urothelium.
C. The tumour identified is poorly differentiated grade 3 urothelial
carcinoma. Tumour invades the full thickness of the bladder wall and beyond
into adipose tissue and the peritoneal surface. The tumour is also present at
the surgical resection margin on the right lateral aspect. Though the tumour
involves the trigone there is no invasion of the prostate gland.
Background urothelium is normal.
The prostate shows nodular hyperplasia and focal necrosis with granulomatous
response.
The samples taken from the ureterics do not show urothelium.
Summary:

mobile peritoneum which is 18 x 12 by less than 0.1 cm. The bladder itself
measures 7 x 7 x 3 cm. There is a soft pink vaginal cuff at the distal aspect of
the bladder urethra which is 2 x 2 x 2 cm. The specimen is inked black around the
outer surface and the specimen is opened along the anterior aspect to reveal a
large ulcerated tumor 5 x 2.5 cm in the -trigone area and focally in the proximal
urethra. The urethra itself is 3.5 cm long by 1.5 cm in circumference and appears
unremarkable. The rest of the bladder mucosa appears to be unremarkable. The
bladder wall around the tumor is thickened 2.0 cm in thickness and the uninvolved
wall is 0.5 cm in thickness. Both attached ureters are opened longitudinally to
reveal unremarkable mucosa with the right ureter 6.5 cm long by 0.6 cm in

Primary Tumor Site Discrepancy
HIPAA Discrepancy
Prior Malignancy History
Dual/Synchronous Primary Noted
Case is (circle:
Reviewer InitialsQUALIFIES I"," Site: The primary tumor site is identified as the bladder based on the pathological examination (E1-3, 5-7). Justification: These sections show high-grade invasive urothelial carcinoma, indicating the bladder as the origin of the malignancy.

Laterality: The laterality of the primary tumor is not explicitly mentioned in the provided information. However, it can be inferred that both right and left sides of the bladder are affected based on the sections examined (E1-3, 5-7, Ell, E12, E13). Justification: Multiple sections from both lateral sides of the bladder show evidence of high-grade urothelial carcinoma.

Histology: The histological type of the primary tumor is high-grade invasive urothelial carcinoma (E1-3, 5-7). Justification: These sections demonstrate the presence of a malignant epithelial tumor consistent with urothelial carcinoma.

Stage: The stage of the primary tumor is not explicitly provided in the given information. However, based on the pathological findings, it can be classified as at least muscle-invasive (T2) urothelial carcinoma. Justification: The tumor extends into the deep muscularis propria without involving perivesical soft tissue, indicating a T2 stage.

Grade: The grade of the primary tumor is high grade, as evidenced by sections E1-3, 5-7. Justification: These sections show grades 3 and 4/4 urothelial carcinoma, which indicates a high-grade malignancy.

Behavior: The behavior of the primary tumor is malignant due to its invasive nature and high-grade characteristics. Justification: High-grade invasive urothelial carcinoma has a strong potential for local invasion and metastasis, making it a malignant neoplasm."

6.5 x 3.2 cm), attached peritoneum (14 x 10 x c 0.1 cm), attached right ureter (4 x
0.4 cm), attached left ureter (4.5 x 0.4 cm), prostate (4 x 4 x 3.5 cm), right
seminal vesicle (2.5 x 1.3 x 0.8 cm) and left seminal vesicle (2.5 x 1 x 0.6 cm).
Opening the prostate and bladder anteriorly reveals a ulcerated and centrally
necrotic tan-white tumor (12 x 9.5 x 3.2 cm) involving the entire right half of the
bladder wall and extending to the dome, posterior wall, and inferiorly to the right
anterior proximal prostate. Tumor diffusely replaces the bladder wall and extends
into the perivesical fat with thickness of 3.2 cm. Tumor comes within 1 mm of the
inked right resection margin. The mucosa beyond the central ulceration is granular
and the uninvolved left lateral wall mucosa is edematous and smooth. The right.
ureter is impinged upon by tumor for a length of 2 cm from the ureterovesical
junction. The mucosa of the bilateral ureters is otherwise unremarkable. The Page 3 of 4
tumor causes a large area of retraction at the peritoneal surface but does not
grossly transgress the peritoneum. The prostatic urethra measures 3.5 x 1.3 cm and
the verumontanum measures 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm. The urethral mucosa is unremarkable.
Serial sectioning through the prostate reveals bilateral periurethral tan-white
nodularities. Tumoris again noted extending to the right anterior proximal
prostate. The seminal vesicles are uninvolved by tumor. Representative sections
are submitted in 20 cassettes.

Case is (circle ►:at. Reviewed:Reviewer Initials"," Site: Bladder and prostate
Laterality: Right half of bladder wall, right anterior prostate
Histology: High-grade muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma with necrotic tan-white tumor
Stage: At least pT3b (based on the extension into perivesical fat and impingement on the right ureter)
Grade: Not provided
Behavior: Malignant

Justification: The description of a large, necrotic tan-white tumor involving the entire right half of the bladder wall and extending to the prostate, with invasion into the perivesical fat and impingement on the right ureter, is consistent with high-grade muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma. The tumor's size and location suggest a significant, malignant process, which would be classified as at least pT3b based on the TNM staging system for bladder cancer. However, without more information, such as depth of invasion or lymph node involvement, a definitive stage cannot be assigned."

CLINICAL DETAILSL4&A3& '1
Bladder cancer. Clinically involved obturator nodes right, cystectomy & right
lymphadenectomy.
MACROSCOPY
1 - Cysto-prostatectomy specimen measuring 125 mm supero-inferiorly x 110 mm
medio-lateral x 65 mm antero-posteriorly. The prostate measures 30 mm superior
to inferior and 45 mm medial to lateral. On sectioning there is a tumour
situated on the right side. The tumour abuts the perivesical fat and measures
20 mm x 6 mm. The background mucosa appears haemorrhagic and possibly
abnormal.
The prostate shows nodularity with the most prominent nodule extending towards
bladder urethral orifice. The seminal vesicles appear spared by tumour, as well
as the prostate.
2 - A piece of fibrous tissue measuring 55 x 38 x 22 mm. Sectioning shows 2
lymph nodes, the larger 40 mm in maximum dimension. Both nodes appear
infiltrated by tumour.
3 - A piece of fibrofatty tissue 48 x 20 x 8 mm. 4 lymph nodes are identified,
the largest 8 mm in maximum dimension.
4 - A piece of ureter 7 mm long. All embedded.
5 - A piece of ureter 10 mm long. All embedded.
MICROSCOPY
Specimens 1, 2, 3, 4 & 5
The sections of the bladder show grade 3 transitional cell carcinoma that
extends into the perivesical fat. Perineural and vascular are present. The
ureteric, urethral and soft tissue margins are clear. The prostate shows areas
of granulomatous inflammation which would be in keeping with BCG treatment.
The background urothelium is reactive but no carcinoma in situ is identified.
6 lymph nodes have been identified. 2 right obturator nodes contain metastatic
tumour while 4 right external iliac nodes are negative.
SUMMARY
Cystoprostatectomy with right obturator and external iliac nodes - completely

uterus, I - Radical cystectomy specimen with attached
vaginal wall.ovaries and anterior
The bladder is approximately 90 mm diameter and has associated adipose tissue
around it. On the attached peritoneal surface there is an irregular
haemorrhagic mass approximately 15 mm diameter, suggesting extension of tumour.
Opening the bladder reveals a fungating mass arising from the posterior wall and
with extensive surface necrosis. The tumour is approximately 70 mm diameter and
is attached by a broad base. In addition, the background mucosa has a 20 mm
separate mass and also two further 4 mm flattish nodules. Section through the
mass shows extension through the bladder wall to come close to the peritoneal
surface. Overall tumour thickness is approximately 40 mm. Away from the main
and smaller tumour nodules the bladder mucosa appears normal, though there is
marked trabeculation of the bladder. The urethra measures 25 mm and has normal
surface mucosa, but there is 5 mm nodule between the midpoint of the urethra and
the anterior vaginal wall.
The uterus measures 60 mm supero-inferiorly, and there is no apparent
abnormality of cervix, endometrium or myometrium. The left ovary measures 20
mm, the right 18 mm, and both show senile atrophy with no further abnormality of
them or of the fallopian tubes.
2 - This is 5 mm of ureter.
3 - This is 9 mm of ureter.

G = tumour left lateral with invasion of fat 0 = endometrium
H = 20 mm separate nodule tumour P = left ovary and tube
I= 5 mm nodules of tumour Q = right ovary and tube
MICROSCOPY
1-The tumour is composed of extensive sheets of undifferentiated carcinoma
cells with small areas of necrosis. In addition, some areas show squamous
differentiation with keratinisation. These features would be consistent with
transitional cell carcinoma, grade 3, with squamous differentiation. Similar
tumour is seen in the main mass and in the separate nodules.I72v ! 35,
The tumour invades right through the bladder wall to reach adipose tissue, and
there is also extravesical lymphovascular invasion. The haemorrhagic tissue on
the peritoneal surface is further tumour. In general the tumour seems 2 or 3 mm
clear of the peritoneal surface, but this peritoneal deposit of tumour suggests
there may be a focus with invasion, or local lymphatic spread to the surface./oho s ti0' In addition, there is a nodule of tumour in the septum between midpoint urethra
and anterior vaginal wall.
Two tiny lymph nodes in perivesical adipose tissue show reactive changes without
tumour. The usual regional lymph nodes have not been supplied.
Away from the tumour, the bladder epithelium is either normal, or shows a minor
degree of glandular differentiation. The urethra mucosa and resection margin is
normal.
The uterus shows no histological abnormality apart from atrophy, and the same
applies to the ovaries.
2 & 3 - These samples show normal ureters.

COMMENT
Sections confirm the gross impression that this tumor is through the wall and
into perivesical fat . This is an interesting tumor in that there is rather
extensive vascular space invasion in sections from the left side of the specimen
as well as the prostatic urethra.

Gross Description:
1)The specimen is received fresh, labeled ""Bladder, prostate, seminal vesicles, peri-vesicles node"". It consists of a cystectomy
specimen measuring 12.0 cm from superior to inferior, 10.0 cm laterally and 6.0 cm from anterior to posterior. The bladder
measures 8.0 x 8.0 x 4.0 cm, the prostate measures 4.0 x 4.0 x 4.0 cm, the right seminal vesicle measures 4.5 x 2.5 x 0.5 cm, the
right vas deferens measures 8.0 cm in length x 0.2 cm in diameter, the left seminal vesicle measures 4.5 x 1.5 x 0.6 cm, and the
left vas deferens measures 7.8 cm in length x 0.2 cm in diameter. The anterior aspect of the bladder is inked blue and the
posterior black. The prostatic urethral margin is shaved and submitted. The bladder is opened along the anterior midline to reveal
a white-tan papillary mass measuring 4.5 x 4.0 cm which is grossly involving the left and right anterior wall and grossly appears to
extend to the dome. The mass lies 5.5 cm from the left ureteral orifice and 5.3 cm from the right ureteral orifice. Both ureters are
probed patent measuring up to 0.2 cm in maximum diameter. The lesion is sectioned to reveal a white firm cut surface and
extending to a depth of 4.2 cm. The mass is 0.2 cm from the inked fat. There is a scar noted on the left posterior wall measuring
1.5 x 0.3 cm, located 3.0 cm from the left ureteral orifice and 4.5 cm from the right ureteral orifice. In addition, there is a white-tan
firm scarred area noted on the right posterior wall measuring 0.5 x 0.3 cm, located 3.5 cm from the left ureteral orifice and 1.5 cm
from the right ureteral orifice. The posterior bladder mucosa is red-brown, congested with ill-defined areas of nodularity. Discrete
perivesical lymph nodes are grossly identified. The prostate is serially sectioned to reveal a diffuse firm parenchyma with a
white-tan whorled appearance. There are several white nodules noted ranging from 0.2 to 0.6 cm in diameter and multiple cysts
ranging from 0.1 to 0.2 cm in diameter. Representative sections are submitted including three sections from each prostatic
quadrant and transition zone. TPS is submitted.

Page 5 of 5 END OF REPORT"," Site: The primary tumor site is the prostate gland, as evidenced by the gross description and sections submitted from the radical prostatectomy specimen.

Laterality: Not provided, as the report does not specify if the tumor is unilateral or bilateral within the prostate gland.

Histology: Adenocarcinoma is suggested by the gross description of the prostate's appearance; however, a definitive histological diagnosis requires microscopic examination.

Stage: Not provided in this report. The TNM (Tumor, Node, Metastasis) staging system typically takes into account the size of the tumor, its invasion into surrounding tissues, and the presence of cancer in lymph nodes or distant organs.

Grade: Not provided in this report. The Gleason score is a common grading system for prostate cancer, which assesses the architectural patterns of the tumor.

Behavior: Malignant, as the patient underwent a radical prostatectomy, indicating that the cancer was likely clinically significant and required surgical intervention."

GROSS:
Two specimens are received in formalin each properly labeled and
identified.
A.The first specimen is designated ""bladder tumor, anterior wall and

4.5 cm x 4.5 cm x 1.5 cm in aggregate. It is entirely submitted in

B.The second specimen is designated ""left renal pelvis biopsy"". It
consists of one piece of tissue measuring 0.1 cm. It is entirely

MICROSCOPIC:
A - The bladder resection contains extensive exophytic and invasive
high grade papillary urothelial carcinoma infiltrating in nests and
cords with areas of clear cell morphology. Invasion into muscularis
propria is identified. Areas of necrosis and calcification are also
seen. Lymphovascular invasion is difficult to evaluate due to
extensive cautery artifact and the presence of cleft-like spaces around
some tumor nests, but no definite lymphovascular invasion is seen. No
perineural invasion is seen.
B - The left renal pelvis biopsy consists of a small fragment of
papillary urothelium with enlarged nuclei and rare mitotic figures.
The pleomorphism is less marked than in the bladder specimen and there
is a lower nucleus to cytoplasm ratio. No lamina propria is present to
allow for evaluation of invasion.

A. Received fresh at the frozen desk is a specimen labeled ""left distal ureter"" consisting of one piece of
luminal tissue measuring 1 x I x 0.5 cm. The specimen is unoriented. The specimen is bisected and
totally submitted for frozen section as Al.
B. Received fresh at the frozen desk is a specimen labeled ""right distal ureter"" consisting of one piece
of unoriented luminal tissue measuring I x 0.5 x 0.5 cm. The specimen is bisected and totally
submitted for frozen section as BI.
C. Received in formalin labeled ""bladder and prostate ""is a specimen consisting of a urinary bladder with
attached prostate and seminal vesicles .The bladder measures 11 x 10 x 4 cm. The exterior surface of
the bladder is covered by fibroadipose tissue and is inked black .After the bladder is opened ,a polypoid
mass measuring 0.7 x 0 .6 x 0.6 cm is identified in the left posterior inferior wall of the bladder 0.2 cm
from the left ureter .On sectioning ,the mass extends through the muscularls into the surrounding
adipose tissue but appears to be 0.4 cm from soft tissue margin (inked black). The tumor portion
involving the bladder wall has the following dimensions: 3 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm. The remaining bladder
mucosa is slightly edematous .A segment of right ureter is 1 cm. It is patent with unremarkable
mucosa .A segment of left ureter is 1 cm. Its mucosa is roughened ,but it is patent .The prostate
measures 3.5 cm transversely ,3 cm anteroposteriorly ,and 3 cm craniocaudally .The capsular surface
is smooth. The gland is inked blue on the right, and yellow on the left. The gland is sectioned from apex
to base transversely at 3 mm intervals perpendicular to the urethra .The cross sections do not reveal a
mass lesion .Rubbery nodularity is not present .The seminal vesicles are unremarkable .Sections are
submitted as follows: CI right ureteric margin, C2 left ureteric margin, C3 urethral margin, C4 tumor with
deepest extension ,C5-C8 tumor involving bladder wall ,C9 left ureter ,C10 right ureter ,C11 posterior

PERMANENT DIAGNOSIS: SAME
Page 6 of 6END OF REPORT"," Site: The specimens were obtained from various locations including the urethra, urachus, bladder, seminal vesicles, prostate, vas deferens, ureters, and periureteral tissue. Justification: The site is explicitly mentioned for most specimens in the surgical pathology report.

Laterality: Most of the specimens were labeled by laterality, including left and right sides of the urethra, vas deferens, ureters, and periureteral tissue. Justification: Laterality is provided for most specimens in the surgical pathology report.

Histology: The histology was described for some specimens, including benign prostatic tissue, adipose soft tissue, and tan soft tissue. However, many specimens did not have a specific histologic diagnosis mentioned. Justification: While some specimens had a histologic diagnosis provided, many did not, making it difficult to categorize them based on histology.

Stage: The stage was not provided for any of the specimens in the surgical pathology report. Justification: There is no information available regarding the staging of the specimens.

Grade: The grade was not provided for any of the specimens in the surgical pathology report. Justification: There is no information available regarding the grading of the specimens.

Behavior: The behavior was not applicable for any of the specimens in the surgical pathology report, as they were all excised or removed for diagnostic purposes and were not malignant. Justification: The behavior is not relevant to the specimens described in the surgical pathology report."

CLINICAL NOTES
PRE-OP DIAGNOSIS: Bladder cancer per op report in
Procedure, partial cystectomy of tumor in dome of the bladder.
GROSS DESCRIPTION
Received fresh for tissue procurement labeled ""bladder
tumor"" is a 10.5 x 5.5 x 5 cm dusky tan-red to gray-brown
mass of tissue. On sectioning, focal areas of soft papilliferous
white-pink tissue in keeping with tumor are identified. A portion
of the presumptive tumor is submitted for tissue procurement as
requested. Received separately within the specimen container is a
copious amount of red-brown clot. No anatomic structures are
evident. Random representative sections focusing on the apparent
tumor are submitted in eight blocks. RS-8. RR1-8 additional
sections submitted to evaluate for the presence or absence of
muscle
invasion.
MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
Microscopic examination reveals extensive high grade
urothelial carcinoma with some clear cell differentiation.
The tumor is extensively exophytic. Invasion of lamina propria is
identified in tissue block 6 and RR3. Muscularis propria is
present. And some foreign body giant cell reactions are identiifed
in the muscularis propria sections. However, no diagnostic
invasive
tumor is identified in those sections of muscularis propria. The
lack of orientation of the specimen precluded accurate margin
evaluation. The exophytic friable nature of the tumor also
precluded accurate margin evaluation.

DIAGNOSIS
A. Bladder tumor, dome of bladder partial cystectomy:
Urothelial carcinoma with areas of clear cell differentiation,

Resident or Fellow.
Electronically Signed Out by [] M.D.
Clinical History:
The patient is a -year-old male with a history of bladder tumor. Bladder
washing showed urothelial carcinoma. The patient underwent radical cystectomy
and neobladder.
Specimens Received:
A: Right pelvic lymph node
B: Left pelvic lymph node
C: Prostate & bladder
Gross Description:
The specimen is received in three containers each labeled with the patient's
name and medical record number.
A. Container A is further designated 31. right pelvic lymph node4. Received
fresh and placed in formalin are fragments of yellow-brown lobulated adipose
tissue measuring 8.5 x 6 x 1.2 cm aggregate .Multiple firm rubbery lymph node
candidates are dissected from the specimen ranging from 0.2-5.5 cm in greatest
dimension .Representative sections are submitted as follows:
A 1-A3 : multiple lymph node candidates
A4-A6: one matted lymph node candidate
B. Container B is further designated 32. left pelvic lymph node4. Received
fresh and placed in formalin are multiple fragments of yellow-brown adipose
tissue measuring 6.5 x 5.5 x 2.0 cm in aggregate. Multiple yellow-brown
firm-rubbery lymph node candidates are dissected from the specimen ranging from
0.2-4.0 cm in greatest dimension. Representative sections are submitted as
follows:
BI-B3: multiple lymph node candidates
B4,B5: one matted lymph node candidate, bisected
C. Container C is further designated 33. bladder and prostate4. Received fresh
and placed in formalin is a specimen of cystectomy weighing 395 gm and the
overall measurement is 14.5 x 10.5 x 6.0 cm. The bladder measures 9.0 x 8.5 x
5.5 cm and the prostate measures 4.0 x 3.3 x 3.0 cm. The bladder is opened from
the anterior wall with a Y-shaped incision . A gray-white, firm, ulcerated mass
is identified in the posterior wall of the bladder measuring 6.3 x 5.1 cm and
raised 2.8 cm from the bladder mucosa. Multiple small papillae are identified
in the periphery of the mass. The outer surface of the bladder and the prostate
is inked black on the left side and blue on the right side. Probing through the
ureters reveals that both ureteral orifices are involved by the tumor. The
specimen is serially sectioned. Both ureters are surrounded by solid tumor.
The tumor displays a thickness of 5.0 cm. The tumor grossly invades through the
bladder wall but not through the surrounding adipose tissue. The center of the
tumor is white and soft and grossly necrotic. The prostate and the seminal
vesicles are not grossly invaded by tumor. No lymph nodes are identified in the
peri-bladder adipose tissue. Received in the same container is a 4.8 cm round
tubular tissue with a diameter of 0.4 cm. Representative sections are submitted as follows:
C l: urethral margin
C2: ureter margin
C3,C4: sections through the right ureter
C5,C6: sections through the left ureter
C7,C8: representative sections of tumor showing deepest invasion
C9-C 11: representative sections of the tumor C12: normal bladder and

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:A-C:See final microscopic-diagnosis.
D:Sections of the bladder show sheets of high-grade malignant cells infiltrating
through the muscularis propria and approaching to the peri-vesicle fat, but not at
the inked margin. The nuclei of these cells are hyperchromatic with high N/C ratio
and indistinct to prominent nucleoli (D6-12).A high ratio of apoptotic activity
is noted as well as increased mitotic activity (2 mitotic figures per 10/phf).
Lymphovascular spaceinvasion is identified. Margins are free of malignancy.
Sections of the prostate show a microscopic focus of malignant glands
infiltrating into the stroma (D19). These neoplastic cells show high N/C ratio
with nuclei showing increased hyperchromatism and distinct nucleoli. In addition,multifocal high- gradeprostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN II-III) is
identified (D19-21). The remaining prostatic gland showsextensive glandular
hyperplasia, chronic inflammation and atrophy.

COMMENT:
The neoplasm consists of solid sheets of neoplastic cells, which at higher power have histological and cytologicalfeatures of a small cell carcinoma .There is extensive necrosis .The cytoplasms have a high N .C ratio and there isprominent nuclear molding present Immunostains for a neuroendocrine origin were performed.The neoplastic cells are positive for synaptophysin ,NSE and CD56 and negative for chromogranin and pankeratin as well as thrombomodulin.
The above immunoprofrle confirms the neuroendocrine differentiation of the small cell component.

*(INTEGRATED REPORT OF FINDINGS BY CONTRIBUTOR ANC PATHOLOGIST STAFF FOR RESEARCH USE ONLY)."," Based on the given form, here are the six categories with one-sentence justifications:

1. Site: Breast - The form includes several breast-related tests such as mammography, ultrasound, and biopsy, indicating the site of suspicion is the breast.
2. Laterality: Not provided - The form does not include any information regarding the laterality (left or right side) of the suspected tumor.
3. Histology: Invasive ductal carcinoma - The pathology report mentions a ""mass infiltrating into the surrounding tissue,"" which is consistent with this type of breast cancer.
4. Stage: pT2 N60 Mo Stage II - Based on the number of positive lymph nodes (6 out of 18 examined), the tumor size (>2 cm), and no evidence of distant metastasis, the stage appears to be II.
5. Grade: Not provided - The form does not include any information regarding the grade of the tumor, which is a measure of how aggressive the cancer cells appear under the microscope.
6. Behavior: Malignant - Invasive ductal carcinoma is a type of malignant tumor that can invade surrounding tissue and metastasize to other parts of the body."

COMMENT:
Part I (right distal ureteral margin ):The focus of urothelial dysplasla is represented only on the original frozen section slides .On the permanent section, the ureter is represented as a complete cross-section with no dyspiasia represented.Part 6 (left distal ureteral margin ):On the original frozen section slides, there was a small detached fragment ofdysplastic urothelium ,with no Invasive urotheilal carcinoma present.However, on the permanent deeper levels Into the tissue ,small foci of invasive urothelial carcinoma are present in the musculan's prop a of therepresen ting
ureter and within the pert ureteral soft tissue .Therefore, invasive carcinoma is close to the true margin and detacheddysplastic urothelium is at the true margin./C-6 -6- 3 CASE SYNOPSIS:

MICROSCOPY
I .
Frozen section report to
No evidence of carcinoma in-situ or invasive malignancy.
Paraffin section report
Paraffin sections show a largely morphologically normal ureter with a focal area
having some nuclear crowding and variation in size sufficient for a diagnosis of
focal dysplasia. There is no evidence of carcinoma in situ or urothelial
neoplasia.
2. Sections of the macroscopically identified tumour confirm a poorly
differentiated solid transitional cell carcinoma arising from dysplastic
urothelium to invade through the muscle but lie free of the circumferential
surgical margins. There are numerous foci of comedo-type necrosis. No
unequivocal vascular invasion is noted. There is no perineural invasion.
The tumour is seen to extend into prostatic ducts and in a pagetoid fashion and
also invade the prostate. The prostatic circumferential margin is
morphologically normal. The surviving prostatic glands are morphologically
normal with no evidence of high grade PIN or evidence of microacinar
adenocarcinoma.
The urethral surgical margin shows evidence of carcinoma in situ and also
invasive carcinoma. The background bladder shows morphologically normal urothelium with no evidence
of dysplasia or carcinoma in situ.
The tumour is seen to extend very close to the seminal vesicle wall but does not
involve the seminal vesicle per se. An accompanying giant cell reaction abutts
the seminal vesicle tissue.
3. Right external iliac nodes. All the specimen was processed and contains
mainly fibrovascular and adipose tissue only. Towards one end there is a focus
of what appears to be a part of a lymph node with marked diathermy artefact
which raises the possibility of invasion by urothelial carcinoma.
Immunohistochemistry has been requested and a supplementary report will be
issued when results are available.
4. Right ureteric margin. This is ureteric tissue showing focal carcinoma in
situ. There is no evidence of a papillary neoplasm.
5.Right obturator node; Five lymph nodes identified, two containing metastatic
carcinoma with extension into extracapsular tissue.
6.Right surgical resection margin ureter; This is morphologically normal
ureteric tissue with no evidence of carcinoma in situ or TCC.
7. Left surgical ureteric margin; This is ureteric tissue showing carcinoma in

SUMMARY: Radical cystectomy and lymphadenectomy; The appearances are those
of a
poorly differentiated solid transitional cell carcinoma invading the prostate
with regional node metastases. There is background carcinoma in situ and the

tu,"," Site: Bladder and prostate
Laterality: Not provided (as the tumor involves the entire bladder)
Histology: Micropapillary carcinoma
Stage: The tumor invades the muscularis and fat, but does not involve the seminal vesicles or vas deferens; no lymph nodes are grossly identified
Grade: Not provided (but the use of terms like ""large fungating"" and ""friable"" suggest a high-grade tumor)
Behavior: Malignant (based on the invasive nature of the tumor)
Justification: The description of the specimen indicates a large, invasive tumor involving the entire bladder and extending into the prostatic urethra. The tumor is described as fungating and friable, which are characteristics of high-grade malignancies. Additionally, the tumor invades the muscularis and fat but does not involve the seminal vesicles or vas deferens. Finally, no lymph nodes were grossly identified, indicating a possible advanced stage of disease."

exophytic mass that measures 2.1 x 2 x 1.5 cm with an adjacent white-tan ulcer
whichmeasures 2.5 x 2 x 1 cm. Sectioning of the ulcerative area reveals a
yellow-tan, firm, homogeneous cut surface. The tumor grossly appears to extend
into the perivesical soft tissue and is located 0.5 cm from the inked radial
margin. Additional sections show the tumor to be located 0.6 cm from the anterior
vaginal wall. The tumor is located 1.3 cm below the left ureterovesical junction
and 3.5 cm from the urethral margin. The uninvolved bladder wall measures 1.0 cm
throughout and the remaining bladder mucosa is pink to tan and unremarkable with no
other lesions identified. The urethra measures 2.5 cm in length and 2.3 cm in
circumference and the urethral mucosa is unremarkable. The attached ureters are
identified and opened. The right ureter measures 5.4 cm in length and 0.5 cm in
circumference and the left distal ureter measures 1.8 cm in length and 0.6 cm in
circumference. Grossly, the ureteral mucosa is unremarkable. The attached uterus

surface .The ectocervix measures 3.9 cm in diameter and shows a pink-tan, smooth,
shiny epithelial surface, and the external os measures 1.5 cm. The uterus is
bivalved. The endocervical canal measures 2.2 cm in length and 0.4 cm in diameter
and is covered by a tan-gray granular mucosa .The endometrial cavity measures 1.2
x 3.4 cm and is covered by a thin endometrial strip measuring 0.1 cm in thickness.
Serial sections show the myornetrium to average 1.3 cm in thickness. A few small
intramural leiomyomas are identified, one in the anterior wall measuring 0.4 cm in
greatest dimension and two in the posterior myometrium measuring 0.4 and 0.6 cm.
The right ovary measures 2.8 x 1 x 0.6 cm and has a tan-gray bosselated surface.
Sectioning reveals a tan-gray, firm cut surface with no significant lesions
identified. The right fallopian tube measures 7.4 cm in length and 0.5 cm in
diameter and grossly is unremarkable. The left adnexa are not identified. The
attached anterior vaginal wall measures 6 x 4.4 cm and is white to tan to pink and
smooth and shiny with no significant lesions identified on the mucosal surface.
Dissection and palpation of the perivesical fatty tissue reveals no lymph nodes.
Representative sections are submitted in a total of 24 cassettes .The remaining
portions of the case are received in formalin.
D:The specimen is received in formalin and labeled ""Lt para aortic lymph nodes"".
it consists of a segment of yellow-tan-brown tissue measuring 3.2 x 1.7 x 0.9 cm.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:A-B:See final microscopic-diagnosis. Page 6 of 6
C:Sections of bladder show an extensive poorly differentiated invasive papillary
transitional cell carcinoma (C11-16), nuclear grade 4/4, located grossly at the
left inferolateral bladder wall approximating the bladder neck and invading into
deep muscularis propria and approaching but not involving the perivesical fatty
tissue.The tumor is characterized by a large (grossly 2.1 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm)
papillary proliferation of tumor cells with moderate to marked pleomorphism. The
nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio is markedly increased in many cells, and the nuclei
are round to oval, some showing large nucleoli. Numerous mitotic figures are seen
as well as necrosis. The tumor deeply infiltrates into the muscularis propria with
the closest inked radial margin located 0.4 cm from the tumor (C13).
Lymphovascular invasion is identified (C11). The left ureterovesical junction is
uninvolved. The tumor is located 0.6 cm from the anterior vaginal wall (C12). All
resection margins are free of both malignancy and urothelial dysplasia. Additional
sections of bladder showfocal areas of erosion and mild to moderate chronic
cystitis with lymphoid aggregates identified. Mild dysplasia is seen in the
trigone but no foci of high-grade dysplasia or in situ carcinoma (flat lesion) are
identified. In addition, a focal foreign body giant cell reaction is seen (CS)
consistent with previous biopsy site.
Sections of anterior vaginal wall show benign squamous epithelium. Sections
from the cervix show benign cervical glandular epithelium and the endometrium
exhibits atrophic changes. Small intramural leiomyomas are identified. The right
ovary shows benign physiological changes and the right fallopian tube is
unremarkable. There is no evidence of atypia or malignancy.

Justification: The diagnosis is based on the gross and microscopic examination of the specimen. The primary tumor site involves the bladder with invasion into the muscle (PT3), and there is no evidence of regional lymph node involvement or distant metastasis (N0, M0). The laterality includes both right and left ureters. The histology is consistent with urothelial carcinoma, which is the most common type of bladder cancer.

The entire invasive portion of the tumor consists of keratinizing squamous
carcinoma. The in-situ component shows both urothelial and squamous cell
carcinoma differentiation (slide labeled B11). Therefore, the tumor is
considered urothelial carcinoma with extensive squamous differentiation.

Gross Description:
The specimens are received in 16 containers each labeled with the patient's name
and medical record number.
Part A. is no additional designation. Received fresh and placed in formalin are
2 elliptical portions of wrinkled brown skin. one is 7.1 x 2.3 cm, excised to a
maximumdepth of 0.3 cm, and the second is 6.2 x 2 cm, excised to a maximum
Page 2 depth of 0.4 cm. Sectioning reveals no masses or lesions .A representativesection of each piece is submitted in Al.
Part B.is further labeled ""2. Anterior pelvic exenteration"". Received fresh and
placed in formalin is a specimen consisting of bladder and uterus which is
overall 20 x 11 x 5.5 cm. The bladder is 10 x 11.x 5.5 cm and covered with
lobulated yellow fibroadipose tissue with cautery artifact. The anterior wall
and around the urethral margin is inked blue .There is a small amount ofapparent labial tissue adjacent to the urethral margin .The labium is 5 x 3 x0.4 cm and wrinkled gray-brown and unremarkable .The right ureter is 2 cm longand 2.5 cm in diameter .The left ureter is 0.6 cm long and 0.6 cm in diameter.Aftershaving the urethral margin ,the bladder is opened along the anterior witha Y-shaped incision ,revealing a partially ulcerated ,partially fungating massalong the posterior and left wall, extending across the anterior partially into
the right lateral wall. The overall dimensions are 8 .5 x 7 cm,with a raisedportion up to 1.8 cm above the mucosa. The mass comes within 4 cm of theurethral margin .sectioning through the left ureter reveals that the mass
encases the ureter and extends to the blue inked margin .sectioning through theposterior wall reveals that the tumor extends to the cervix ,with a maximumdepth of 3.5 cm. The tumor also extends into the right wall and comes within 0.1
cm of the inked margin .The uninvolved mucosa is edematous. No lymph node
candidates are identified in the attached adipose tissue .Gross photographs aretaken.
Posterior to the bladder is a 9 x 6 cm portion of wrinkled pink-tan mucosa
consistent with vaginal wall at terminating in a cervical opening The anterior
half of the cervix is a 1.3 by the 1.3 and apparent posterior half is missing
and consists of cauterized tissue .The attached uterus is 5 cm from cornu tocornu 4.8 cm from fundus to lower uterine segment and 3.3 cm from anterior to
posterior .The serosa covering the uterus is glistening red and unremarkable.
The left fallopian tube has a white clip. The left fallopian tube is 8 cm long
and up to 1.2 cm in diameter. The left ovary is 2.5 x 1.8 x 0.9 cm. The right
fallopian tube has no clip but is focally disrupted. The length of the distal
portion is 7 cm with a circumference of 0.7 cm. The right ovary is 2.5 x 1.5 x
0.7 cm.The bilateral ovaries are bisected to reveal unremarkable gray firm
tissue.The uterus is opened from anterior to posterior to reveal a 3.4 x 0.3 by
0.3 cm endometrial cavity with unremarkable tan lining. No masses or lesions are

Clinical History:
The patient is a •year-old male with invasive urothelial carcinoma, high grade
undergoing cystoprostatectomy.
Specimens Received:
A: Right pelvic lymph node
B: Left pelvic lymph node
C: Left pelvic lypmh node
D: Bladder, prostate, seminal vesicle, vas deferens
Gross Description:
The specimens are received in four containers each labeled with the patient's
name and medical record number.
A. The first container is additionally identified as, ""right pelvic lymph
node"". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 5.5 x 5.5 x 1.5 cm aggregate
of yellow-tan lobulated adipose tissue. The specimen is dissected for lymph
nodes and 7 are found measuring 0.3-4.5 cm in greatest dimension and are
submitted as follows:
A 1: 3 lymph node candidates
A2-A4:, 1bisected lymph node in each cassette
A5-A6: I lymph node ,sectioned
B. The second container is additionally identified as, ""left pelvic lymph
node"". Received fresh for intraoperative consult is a 3.5 x 2.4 x 1.6 cm
yellow-tan tissue fragment which is bisected to reveal a 2.2 cm white-tan lymph
node candidate. A representative section is frozen and called ""metastatic
carcinoma"" by Dr. [] The frozen remnant is submitted as BI FS and the
remaining lymph node candidate is submitted as B2-B4.
C. The third container is additionally identified as, ""left pelvic lymph node"".
Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 10 .5 x 5.5 x 1 .5 cm aggregate of yellow-tan lobulated adipose tissue. The specimen is dissected for lymph node
candidates. Sections are submitted as follows:
C 1: 5 lymph node candidates
C2: 2 lymph node candidates
C3: I lymph node candidate, bisected
C4: 1 lymph node candidate
C5: 1 lymph node candidate
C6-7: 1 lymph node, sectioned
D. The fourth container is additionally identified as, ""bladder, prostate,
seminal vesicles and vas deferens"".
Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 393.7 g, 16.5 x 15.5 x 4.5 cm
cystoprostatectomy specimen consisting of a 7 x 6 x 3.5 cm bladder with attached
mesenteric fat and a 4.3 x 4 x 3 cm prostate. The right seminal vesicles
measure 4.2 x 1.7 x 0.9 cm and right vas deferens measures 9.5 cm in length by
0.2-0.5 cm in diameter. The left seminal vesicles measures 4.5 x 1.6 x 0.8 cm
and left vas deferens measures 10.5 cm in length by 0.2-0.5 cm in diameter. The
right ureteral stump measures 1.6 cm in length by 0.6 cm in diameter, the left
measures 2 cm in length and 0.6 cm in diameter, and both demonstrate intact,
patent lumens to the trigone.
The right half of the prostate is inked blue and the left half is inked black.
The soft tissue surrounding the bladder is inked black. The bladder and prostate
are opened anteriorly along the urethra. The prostate is surrounded by a thin,
intact membranous capsule and sectioning demonstrates rubbery, pink-tan,
peri-urethral nodularity with no discrete masses or indurations. Approximately
50% of the gland is submitted.
The opened bladder reveals a 2.8 x 2.7 cm indurated, tan-yellow shaggy ulcerated
mass with a hyperemic rim in the left lateral wall which partially extends to
the anterior, posterior, and trigone and involving the left ureter orifice. The
ulceration is 5 cm from the distal urethral margin and 0.7 cm from the prostate
base. On cut section, the mass extends to the serosa, possibly the
peri-vesicular adipose tissue to a depth of 1.1 cm and is 0.2 cm from the deep
margin. The surrounding bladder mucosa is tan-pink to red and edematous with a
uniform 0.9 cm wall thickness.
Gross photographs are taken.
Representative sections are submitted as follows:
D 1: Left ureter margin
D2: Right ureter margin
D3: Distal urethral margin
D4: Prostatic apical margin
D5-D8: Representative right prostate
D9-D 12 Representative left prostate D13: Right seminal vesicles

1.Tubular piece of tissue measuring 12 x 5mm diameter. No focal lesion.
2. Tubular piece of tissue measuring 14 x 6mm diameter.
3. Bladder and prostate with attached fibrofatty tissue. The bladder measures
40mm St x 35mm ML. The prostate measures 30mm SI, 30mm ML x 21mm AP.
Attached
fibrofatty tissue measures up to 120mm maximum dimension. No lymph nodes
identified.
In the left lateral wall of the bladder there is an ulcerated area 20mm.
Underlying this is a hard tumour extending into perivessicular fat, measuring
25mm St by approximately 25mm ML. The tumour extends for a depth of 22mm and
is
very close to the left lateral soft tissue circumferential resection margin.
Elsewhere, on the right side of the urethral orifice is an area of mucosal
irregularity 15 x 12mm.
MICROSCOPY
The tumour seen in the left lateral wall of the bladder is a sarcomatoid variant
of transistional cell carcinoma/high grade urothelial carcinoma. The tumour is
composed predominantly of high grade malignant spindle cells with no
heterologous elements evident. Superficially, the morphology of the tumour is
more reminiscent of a solid conventional high grade urothelial carcinoma and
there is some overlying carcinoma in situ from which the tumour appears to be
arising. There is no definite evidence of lymphovascular invasion.
The tumour invades through the muscularis propria into the perivessicular fat
(pT3) and is 2mm from the circumferential resection margin at its closest point
(block 3B).
The macroscopically abnormal area near the bladder neck shows evidence of oedema
and increased vascularity associated with urothelial hyperplasia. There is some
patchy dysplasia in this area which just amounts to CIS in a few foci. The
prostatic urethra shows evidence of similar oedema and increased vascularity
associated with von Brunn's nests and hyperplasia but there is no evidence of
dysplasia and the prostatic resection margin is clear of neoplasia.
The prostate, vas deferens and seminal vesicles show no significant abnormality.
The left and right distal ureteric resection margins (specimens 1 and 2) show no
definite evidence of carcinoma in situ.
SUMMARY
Cystoprostatectomy:
Sarcomatoid variant of high grade urothelial carcinoma.(G3,pT3)
2mm clearance from left lateral circumferential resection margin.
Adjacent carcinoma-in-situ. Urothelial resection margins clear.

Gross Description;.
A. Part A is right ureter. Initially received in the fresh state for frozen section analysis is a single light tan
tubal fragment of soft tissue,. 4 mm in length and 4 mm in diameter. The surgical margin is marked blue.
The specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section analysis with the residual frozen tissue submitted in
Al for permanent sections,
8. Part B is left ureter. Initially received in the fresh state for frozen section analysis is a light tan tubal
fragment of soft tissue, 5 mm in length and 4 mm in diameter. The narrow 1.5 mm lumen is patent. The
surgical margin is marked orange. The specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section analysis with the
residual frozen tissue submitted in BI for permanent sections
C. Part C is designated as uterus, bilateral tubes and ovaries, bladder. Initially received in the fresh state
forpossible is a generous portion of tissue consisting of a bladder radical
cystectomy and a hysterectomy specimen with extensions of urethra and vaginal tissue. The specimen
weighs in aggregate 343 grams and the bladder is 8.0 x 7.2 x 4.2 cm with a 4.0 cm extension of urethral
tract, 1.4 cm in diameter. The attached vaginal vault has been previously incised lengthwise measuring
9.2 cm in length and up to 3.0 cm. in diameter. The uterus is 5.8 cm in length, 4.0 cm right to left lateral
and 2.3 cm posterior-anterior. The bilateral fallopian tube segments and ovaries areintact. The peritoneal
reflection is glistening, smooth, light tan and transitions to deep red over a palpable mass within the
bladder.
The surgical margins-surfaces are now differentially inked as follows: posterior margin of the length of the
entroitus is marked black as well as the uterine serosa, the distal margin of the vagina is marked orange,
the anterior margin of the perivesicular fat is marked blue and the distal margin of the urethral tract is
marked orange.
Initially, the bladder is incised in a Y-shaped fashion and opened to reveal a large, dense to shaggy and
delicate-, red-tan tumor mass measuring upwards of 7.3 x 6.0 cm and grossly arising mid anterior through
the left lateral and dome of the fundus. The tumor advances inferiorly along the lateral mucosa to the
bladder neck. at the edge of the urethral orifice, 4.0 cm from the distal urethral surgical margin. Initial
sectioning through the tumor mass demonstrates gross full thickness involvement of the bladder wall,
anteriorly. Representative portions of tumor, para-neoplastic and normal bladder mucosa are submitted for

ectocervix is up to 3.3 cm in diameter with petechial congestion and a 1.0 cm as. The squamocolumnar
junction is poorly demarcated with the endocervical component predominantly glistening, smooth to
slightly trabecular. The bisected uterus demonstrates a triangular endometrium, 3.0 x 1.6 cm, and
flattened to less than 0.1 cm with several minute, clear fluid-filled cysts. The myometrium is rubbery, pink
and tan, without discreet nodularity or unusual areas of change suggestive of neoplasia.
The right fallopian tube with fimbria is 5.5 x 0.4 cm, hyperemic, pink and tan, with a delicate lumen. The
1.8 x 1.2 x 0.7 cm ovary is. cerecreform, yellow-tan. The bisected ovary demonstrates atrophic, rubbery to
indurated parenchyma with a few small cysts, up to 0.4 cm, with straw colored mucin. No discreet
modularity appreciated. The left falilopian tube with flmbria is 5.6 x 0.4 cm, hyperemic, pink and tan, with
a delicate lumen. The 1.4 x 1.1 x 0.8 cm ovary is cerebreform, yellow-tan. The ovary is trisected, to yeveal
soft to induraded, atrophic, yellow tan parenchyma. There are no discreet nodularities or unusual areas of
change, suggestive of neoplasia.

F.Received in formalin labeled with the patient 's name and
""bladder, prostate gland and seminal vesicles"" is a radical
cystectomy specimen with attached fat measuring 16 x 11 x 7 cm.
The attached prostate measures 4.5 x 4 x 4 cm. A 3 cm defect is
identified on the prostatic urethral margin. This is grossly
consistent with tissue taken for frozen section evaluation. The
specimen is inked black on the left and blue on the right. The
right seminal vesicle measures 5 x 1 x 1 cm. The right vas
deferens measures 7 cm in length. The left seminal vesicle
measures 5x 1 x 1 cm. The left vas deferens measures 11 cm in
length. The left and right ureters are embedded in the fat and
have been previously taken for frozen section evaluation. The
bladder is opened anteriorly and in the dome of the bladder a
circumscribed tan, friable mass is identified measuring 2.4 x 2
x 1 cm. The remainder of the bladder mucosa has a retracted
cobble-stoned appearance. No additional gross tumor is
identified. The cut surface of the mass has a very friable tan
glistening appearance and grossly appears to have invaded into
the muscularis. The posterior bladder all on cut surface is
grossly unremarkable. The left and right lateral bladder walls
are serially sectioned and are grossly unremarkable. The right
side of the prostate is serially sectioned to reveal a focally
nodular tan-pink grossly unremarkable parenchyma. The left
prostate is serially sectioned and in the lower one third the

Tte^.ed'."," Based on the given pathology report, here are the six categories with their corresponding information:

1. Site: The specimens are taken from various sites including the bladder, prostate, and kidney, among others. This is important in identifying the origin of the tumor or abnormal growth.
2. Laterality: Some specimens indicate laterality, which refers to the side of the body where the sample was taken. For example, some samples were taken from the left or right kidney or bladder.
3. Histology: This category refers to the study of the microscopic structure of tissues. The report includes various types of histology such as adenocarcinoma, transitional cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma, among others.
4. Stage: The stage of cancer is not explicitly provided in the report. However, some specimens are labeled as ""pT"" or ""pN,"" which are abbreviations for primary tumor and lymph node involvement, respectively. These labels suggest that the staging was already determined but not included in the report.
5. Grade: The grade of cancer refers to how abnormal the cells look under a microscope and how quickly they are likely to grow and spread. This information is not provided in the report.
6. Behavior: The behavior of the tumor or growth is also not explicitly stated in the report. However, some specimens are labeled as ""malignant,"" indicating that they are cancerous and have the ability to invade nearby tissues and spread to other parts of the body.

Justification: These six categories are commonly used in pathology reports to provide a comprehensive description of the tumor or growth, its origin, characteristics, and behavior. They are essential in determining the appropriate treatment plan and prognosis for the patient."

However, there are references to ""WAL,"" ""TRrA,"" and ""Procedure Date of Procedure,"" which suggest that it may be related to the prostate or female reproductive system. More information is needed for a definitive answer.

Laterality: Information on the laterality of the tumor is not provided in the text.

Histology: The histological pattern is described as ""HistoloicalPattern"" with cell distribution and structural patterns mentioned, but no definitive histological diagnosis can be made based on the given information.

Stage: Based on the TNM staging system, the primary tumor appears to be at stage T2N0M0, indicating that it is limited to the prostate or female reproductive organ without involvement of lymph nodes or distant metastasis (time to LN2 and formalin not specified).

Grade: The nuclear grade is mentioned as I-III, but a definitive histological diagnosis is required for proper grading.

Behavior: Based on the limited information provided, it is unclear whether the tumor is malignant or benign. More information is needed to determine its behavior."

Gross Description :Tumor occupies bladder wall. It is invasive and protruded, ill - margins with
2x1.5x1.2cm in size, soft and gray surface.
Microscopic Description :Tumor cells are hyperplastic to arrange to form sheets or nest or groups or
cords one by one. Tumor cells have moderate and eosinophilic. Nuclei are very enlarged and varriability
in shape and size, irregular nuclear membranes, nucleoli and abnormal chromatin patterns. Mitoses are
common. Tumor invades in musculari propria and vessel.

A.Received fresh for frozen section labeled ""distal right
ureter""is a 0.5 x 0.3 x 0.1 cm segment of ureter .The specimen
is inked yellow and entirely submitted in cassette Al-FS.
B.Received fresh for frozen section labeled ""distal left
ureter"" is a 0 .5x 0.4 x 0.1 cm segment of ureter .The specimen
is inked black and entirely submitted in cassette B1-FS.
C.Received in formalin and labeled ""bladder and prostate"" is a
469 g, cystoprostatectomy specimen (15.0 x 13.0 x 6.0 cm). The
specimen comes with an abundant amount of perivesicular adipose
tissue attached. The cystoprostatectomy specimen consists of a
bladder (6.5 x 5.5 x 5.0 cm) with attached right and left ureter
(1.0 cm in length). There is a prostate (5.0 cm from
left-to-right, 3.5 cm from anterior-to-posterior, 3.3 cm from
apex-to-bladder-neck-margin) with attached right seminal vesicle
(3.0 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm), right vas deferens (12.0 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm),
left seminal vesicle (3.5 x 2.5 x 0.6 cm), left vas deferens (3.0
x 0.3 x 0.2 cm). The right side of the specimen is inked blue;
the left side of the specimen is inked black.
In the left anterior and posterior lateral wall of the bladder,
there is a 4.5 x 2.5 x 0.9 cm pink-tan polypoidmass.This lesion
extends across the midline into the right anterior and posterior
bladder and extends towards the bladder-prostate junction. ThePage 2 of 4 Page 3 of 4
mass' cut surface is white-tan, firm and extends into the
perivesicular fat. The mass at the posterior bladder, comes to
within 0.5 cm to the perivesicular fat margin (inked black) and
on the anterior bladder is 1.0 cm. from the perivesicular fat
margin (inked black). The lesion is 2.5 cm from the nearest
peritonealized surface. The ureteral orifices are patent. There
are no other discrete masses or suspicious areas grossly
identified. The remainder of the mucosa is tan, glistening and
pliable.
The prostate has a white-tan cut surface with no discrete nodules
or masses grossly identified. There are 5 lymph nodes dissected
out ranging from 0.3 to 1.1 cm in greatest dimension.
Also received in the container is a 38 cm in length and 0.8 cm in
diameter, brown-tan rubber tubing consistent with a catheter.
Sections are submitted as follows: Cl - right trigone, C2 - left
trigone, C3 - posterior bladder-prostate transition, C4 -
anterior bladder-prostate transition, C5-9 - mass in left lateral
posterior wall, C10 - mass and lateral anterior wall, C11 - right
lateral wall, C12 - posterior wall, C13 - anterior wall, C14 -
dome, C15 - right seminal vesicle insertion point and
cross-sections through right seminal vesicle and vas deferens,
C16 - left seminal vesicle insertion point and cross-section
through left seminal vesicle and vas deferens, C17-18 - right
anterior apex perpendicularly cut, C19-20 - left apex
perpendicularly cut, C21 - right anterior prostate, C22 - left
anterior prostate, C23-25 - right posterior prostate, C26-28 -
left posterior prostate, C29 - 5 lymph nodes ranging from 0.3 to
1.1 cm in greatest dimension.
D.Received fresh for frozen section labeled ""right pelvic lymph
node"" is a single lymph node measuring 4.0 cm in greatest
dimension. The lymph node is serially sectioned and entirely
submitted in cassette Dl-FS and D2-FS.
E.Received fresh for frozen section labeled ""left pelvic lymph
nodes"" are 4 lymph nodes ranging from 1.3 to 5.5 cm in greatest
dimension. Sections are submitted as follows: E1-FS and E2-FS
contains one lymph node (5.5 cm) inked blue and serially
sectioned, E3-FS - two lymph nodes, one inked yellow, one inked
black, E4-FS and E5-FS - one lymph node (5.0 cm) inked orange and
bisected.

Laterality: Left anterior and posterior lateral wall
Histology: Urothelial (transitional cell) carcinoma
Stage: pT3a (tumor invades perivesical fat)
Grade: High-grade
Behavior: Malignant (cancerous)

Justification: The site refers to the location of the tumor in the bladder, as described in the gross examination. Laterality indicates that the tumor is primarily located on the left anterior and posterior lateral wall. The histology is specified as urothelial carcinoma based on microscopic examination. The stage is determined by the invasion of the tumor into the perivesical fat, classified as pT3a. The grade is reported as high-grade, consistent with the description of marked atypia and poor differentiation in the microscopic description. Lastly, the behavior is malignant, implying that the tumor has the potential to invade surrounding tissues and metastasize."

A - Received in forrnalin labeled bladder tumor , left lateral wall* is a 5.0 x 4.5 x 2.3 cmaggregate of multiple pieces of irregular tan-pink friable tissue which is submitted in toto in
cassettes AI-A14.
B -- Received in formalin labeled ""prostatic urethra"" are two irregular tan-pink rubbery
tissues both averaging 2.0 x 0.6 x 0,4 cm. Each specimen is bisected and submitted in its
entirety in cassettes B1-132.
MICROSCOPIC:
Microscopic examination of the transurethral resection of the left lateral bladder wall tumorreveals a high grade papillary urothelial carcinoma which in some areas has an invertedpattern.The tumor shows extensive multifocai invasion into the lamina propria and the
muscularis propria with focal invasion into the muscularis propria. Additionally,
lymphovascular invasion is also seen .Approximately 5% of the tumor also has a
micropapillary pattern. The tumor additionally shows multifocal extensiveareas ofsquamous as well as glandular differentiation. ^--
Examination of the prostatic urethral tissue reveals benign urothelium with underlying
chronic inflammation and benign prostatic tissue with some mild chronic prostatitis as well
as a stromal nodule. Urothelial dysplasia or malignancy is not noted. Prostatic
intraepithelial neopiasia or malignancy is seen.

Description of findings:
Tumor .Along the right superior lateral wall Is a red -brown, firm pedunculated
mass measuring 1.5 x 1 .5 x 1.2 an .Surrounding the mass is an area of dark red
edema measuring 3.5 x 1 .5 cm. This area of edema surrounds the right ureteral
orifice at the posterior wall Is eroded, flattened firm measuring approximately
3.0 x 2.0 cm which Is adjacent to the left ureteral orifice. Sectioning through
the mass reveals invasion Into the lamina propria .No definite Invasion into
the muscularis propria is Identified. Upon sectioning through the mass, the
mass fragmented from the bladder muc osa .Sectioning through the areas of edema
and flattened mucose reveals no evidence of Invasion
Uninvolved mucosa: There Is very little normal mucosa present. No other
discrete masses or lesions are Identified.
Prostate ,seminal vesicles and vase deferentla: Sectioning through the prostate
reveals a pale tan to yellow mulfinodular architecture with multiple cystic
areas ranging in size up to 0.3 cm in diameter .A discrete nodular mass is not

Prior Malignancy History"," Site: The primary tumor site is the urinary bladder, with potential involvement of the distal ureter based on biopsy results.

Laterality: The tumor is located on the right side, affecting the superior lateral wall of the urinary bladder and potentially involving the right distal ureter.

Histology: The histological diagnosis is urothelial carcinoma, based on the gross and microscopic findings.

Stage: Based on the provided information, the tumor has invaded the lamina propria but there is no definite invasion into the muscularis propria. This suggests a non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, most likely stage T1 (not provided).

Grade: The grade of the tumor is not explicitly mentioned in the provided information. However, the presence of atypical urothelium suspicious for carcinoma in situ (CIS) in the left distal ureter biopsy may indicate a high-grade tumor.

Behavior: The behavior of the tumor is malignant, as it shows features consistent with urothelial carcinoma."

A7: One lymph node bisected
A8-12: Remainder of specimen
B. The second container is additionally identified as, ""#2 left pelvic lymph
node"". Received fresh and placed in formalin is an aggregate of yellow-tan
lobulated fibroadipose tissue that measures 7 x 6 x 1.5 cm. The specimen is dissected for lymph nodes and is entirely submitted as follows:
B 1: One lymph node bisected
B2: Three lymph nodes
B3: One lymph node bisected
B4: Two lymph nodes
B5: Three lymph nodes
B6: Two lymph nodes
B7: One lymph node bisected
B8: One lymph node
B9: One lymph node
B 10-16: Remainder of specimen
C. The third container is additionally identified as, ""#3 left ureter tip"".
Received fresh and placed in formalin is an unoriented portion of ureter that
measures 0.6 x 0.5 cm. The external surface is white, dense, gray, smooth and
glistening and focally covered by yellow lobulated adipose tissue. The specimen
is bisected and entirely submitted in cassette Cl.
D. Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 316.7 g, 17 x 8.5 x 4.2 cm
cystoprostatectomy specimen consisting of a 7.5 x 6 x 3.5 cm bladder with
attached mesenteric fat and a 5.5 x 4.2 x 3.8 cm prostate with a 34 cm long by
0.6 cm diameter rubbery catheter in place in the urethra. Also received are 2
detached vessels both 6.5 cm in length and 0.4 cm in diameter. The bladder has a
4.5 x 3.5 cm area of disruption on the lower anterior wall and the prostate has
a 2.5 x 2 cm area of disruption at the apex. The right seminal vesicles measure
3 x 1.4 x 0.6 cm and right vas deferens measures 8.5 cm in length by 0.6 cm in
diameter. The left seminal vesicles measures 3.5 x 1.5 x 0.7 cm and left vas
deferens measures 8 cm in length by 0.5 cm in diameter. The right ureteral
stump measures 2.3 cm, the left measures 2 cm, the urethral stump measures 0.7
cm, and each demonstrates an intact, patent lumen.
The right half of the prostate is inked blue and the left half is inked black.
The outside of the bladder is inked black. The bladder and prostate are opened
anteriorly along the urethra. The outer surface of the prostate is tan and
shaggy. Sectioning demonstrates rubbery, pink-tan, peri-urethral nodularity with
no discrete masses or indurations.
The opened bladder reveals a 5 x 4.5 x 2.5 cm firm, ulcerated, tan-brown mass
with a heaped up rim of firm tissue located in the upper anterior wall and upper
portion of right lateral wall. On cut section, the mass is firm and tan-white
with hemorrhagic foci and patches of necrosis centrally and extends into the
adipose tissue to a depth of 2.5 cm, to within 0.1 cm of the deep margin. The
surrounding bladder mucosa is wrinkled and tan with a uniform 0.2 cm wall
thickness. Bilateral ureteral orifices, adjacent to the trigone, are identified
and probe patent. Photographs are taken. Representative sections are submitted as follows:
D 1: Left ureter resection margin
D2: Right ureter resection margin
D3: Distal prostatic urethral margin
D4: Prostate apex
D5: Section of right prostate through verumontanum
D6: Section of left prostate through verumontanum
D7-D8: Section of right prostate above verumontanum
D9-D10: Section of left prostate above verumontanum
D 11: Seminal vesicles and vas differentia
D 12: Mass closest to inked outer surface
D 13: Mass at mucosal surface
D14: Mass and adjacent grossly normal bladder wall
D 15: Uninvolved bladder mucosa bladder dome
D 16: Uninvolved bladder mucosa anterior wall
D 17: Uninvolved bladder mucosa posterior wall at trigone
E. The fifth container is additionally identified as, ""#5 distal left ureter"".
Received fresh and placed in formalin is an unoriented portion of ureter and
attached fibroconnective tissue the specimen measures 0.9 x 0.6 x 0.2 cm. The
portion of ureter is received previously opened with the mucosa exposed. The
specimen is bisected and entirely submitted cassette El.
F. The sixth container is additionally labeled as ""#6 distal right ureter"".
Received fresh and placed in formalin is a portion of ureter that measures 3.5 x
0.5 x 0.5 cm. The specimen is further oriented as stitch on non-margin side,
which is inked yellow. The external surface is pink to tan smooth and glistening
focally covered by yellow lobulated adipose tissue. The specimen is entirely
submitted as follows:
F 1: Margin
F2: Non-margin side

Gross Description:
Received are eight containers each labeled with the patient name.
Part A is received fresh for frozen section diagnosis and is additionally
labeled ""left ureter stitch distal."" The specimen consists of a segment of
ureter having a length of 0.3 cm and a diameter of 0.5 cm. The residual frozen
section tissue is entirely submitted in cassette A for permanent sections.
Part B is received fresh for frozen section diagnosis'and is additionally
labeled ""right ureter stitch distal."" The specimen consists of a segment of
ureter having a length of 0.5 cm and a diameter of 0.8 cm. The specimen is
bisected at the time of frozen section diagnosis. The residual frozen section
tissue is entirely submitted in cassette B for permanent sections.
Part C is received fresh for and is additionally labeled
""bladder and prostate."" The specimen consists of a cystoprostatectomy specimen,
having overall dimensions of 8.5 x 8 x 7.5 cm. The specimen consists of a 4.5 x
4 x 3.5 cm bladder with attached bilateral ureters (right ureter length 4 cm and
left ureter length 3 cm) and a 4.5 x 3.5 x 3.5 cm prostate with attached
bilateral seminal vesicles and vas deferens .The prostate is inked as follows:
right side yellow, left side black, and posterior red. Anteriorly, the
bladder is inked black. The urethral margin is shaved. The specimen is opened
anteriorly to reveal a 6.5 x 3 x 2.5 cm partially exophytic and partially
ulcerated pink-tan mass involving the inferior half of the bladder
circumferentially. The dome of the bladder appears uninvolved. The mass
appears to invade into the muscularis propria and comes to within 0.2 cm of the inked anterior (closest) soft tissue margin. Additionally, the mass appears to
invade the prostate and comes to within 1.2 cm of the urethral margin. The
uninvolved bladder mucosa is pink-tan, wrinkled and somewhat edematous. After
amputating the prostate from the bladder and removing the bilateral seminal
vesicles and vas deferens, the prostate weighs 49 g. There is a moderate amount
of perivesicular fat, and after the use of a chemical clearing agent, one tan
lymph node is identified, having dimensions of 0.8 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm.

Surgical Pathology Report
*Final*
Surgical Pathology Report
DIAGNOSIS:
A-E. Bladder, prostate, and pelvic lymph nodes, excision:
Procedure: Radical cystoprostatectomy.
Tumor site: Right posterior lateral wall.
Tumor size: 2.5 x 2.0 x 1.2 cm.
Histologic type: Urothelial (transitional cell carcinoma), with
nested pattern .
Associated epithelial lesions: Noneidentified.
Histologic grade: High-grade, grade3(of 3).
Tumor configuration: Solid/nodule with ulceration.
Microscopic tumor extension: Perivesical fat.
Margins: Negative, right and left distal ureter (specimens C and
D), and urethra.
Lymph-vascular invasion: Absent.
Perinodal invasion: Present.
Prostate: Extensive invasion by urothelial carcinoma.
Immunoperoxidase studies were performed on paraffin-embedded tissue.
These show that the neoplastic cells are reactive with antibodies
to p63, but not cytokeratin 5/6, prostatic acid phosphatase or
prostate-specific antigen. These findings support the diagnosis of
extensive involvement by urothelial carcinoma rather than prostatic
adenocarcinoma, as diagnosed in the review of previous outside
material
Seminal vesicles: Negative for malignancy.
Lymph nodes (Specimens A and B): Metastatic carcinoma consistent
with bladder primary, 1/3 left pelvic. Sections of the right pelvic
lymph nodes show no evidence of metastatic carcinoma, four nodes.
Research tissue (block E22): Tumor (urothelial carcinoma) and
normal prostatic tissue identified.
Pathologic staging: pT4, pN1.

bisected; A3) two lymph nodes, larger bisected.
B. Received fresh labeled and ""left pelvic lymph
nodes"" are several pieces of adipose tissue, aggregating to 8.5 x
4.5 x 2.5 cm. Within the adipose tissue are several fatty lymph
nodes. All of the lymph nodes are submitted in cassettes labeled
as follows: Bl)One lymph node bisected; B2) one lymph
node bisected; B3) one lymph node bisected.
C.Received fresh labeled and ""left distal ureteral
margin"" is a tubular segment of tan tissue consistent with ureter,
0.6 cm in maximum dimension. Entirely submitted for frozen section
in one cassette labeled

is a tubular segment of pink-tan tissue with attached fat, 1.2 cm in
maximum dimension. Entirely submitted for frozen section in one
cassette labeled
E.Received fresh labeled and ""bladder and
prostate"" is a radical cystoprostatectomy specimen, 195 g and 10.5 x
6.2 x 4.2 cm. The prostate is separately 3.5 x 3.5 x 2.7 cm. The
specimen is opened through the prostatic urethra and reveals a
mucosal ulcerating mass in the right posterolateral wall, 2.5 x 2 x
1.2 cm. The mass extends into the bladder wall and possibly extending up to and into the right portion of the prostate. The
remaining bladder wall is edematous. The right and left ureteral
orifices appear obstructed by the mass. Fresh tissue of the tumor,
normal bladder, and prostate are submitted for
Multiple representative sections are submitted in
cassettes labeled as follows: El) Frozen section distal
urethral margin; E2) anterior bladder wall; E3) bladder dome; E4)
right lateral wall; E5) right lateral wall; E6) posterior wall; E7)
posterior wall; E8) right posterolateral wall; E9) right ureteral
bladder orifice; E10) left ureteral bladder orifice; Ell) right and
left seminal vesicles; E12) right prostate apex; E13) left prostate
apex; E14) right prostate mid; E15) left prostate mid; E16) right
prostate base; E17) left prostate base; E18-E20) junction of right
prostate and right bladder wall; E21) possible parabladder lymph
nodes; E22) mirror image of tissue corresponding to research IRB
F.Received fresh labeled and ""right kidney"" is a
total nephrectomy specimen, 12 x 7.5 x 4.5 cm, 168 g. After the
perirenal fat is removed, the kidney is 80 g and 9.2 x 3.8 x 2.5 cm.
The attached ureter is 15 x 0.6 x 0.6 cm. The capsule strips
easily. The cortices are yellow-brown and granular. The cut
surface of the kidney shows a grossly dilated renal pelvis with
blunting of the cortices, changes consistent with hydronephrosis.
The corticomedullary junction is distinct. There is no evidence of
masses or cysts. The ureter is dilated which shows no evidence of
tumor. Representative sections are submitted in cassettes labeled
as follows: Fl)Vascular and ureteral margins; F2-F3)
sections of kidney; F4) additional sections of dilated ureter.

Addendum Diagnosis
1.Left lateral bladder wall:
The tumor has mixed histologic features. By immunostains, staining heterogeneity was present in the following markers: CK7,
CK20, GATA3, HMWK (34be12), p63/4A4 and CD117. Strong staining with p16 and focal synaptophysin was present. The tumor
was negative for chromogranin, PAX8, racemase, calponin, ERG and S100. There were focal areas of faint PSA and PSMA
labeling, which might suggest prostatic differentiation, but their true significance is not clear as the tumor is showing more
convincing differentiation along the urothelial phenotype. This case was discussed at the
Some of the immunohistochemistry and ISH tests were developed and their performance characteristics were determined by the Department of Pathology. They have not been cleared or approved
by the US Food and Drug Administration .The FDA has determined thatsuch clearance or approval is not necessary .These tests are used forclinical purposes .They should not be regarded as
investigational or for research .This laboratory is certified under Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA '88)asqualified to perform high complexity clinical laboratory testing.

CLINICAL INFORMATION:
Pre-Op Dx: bladder cancer; S/P hiatal hernia repair, TURP
GROSS EXAMINATI ON:A:Thespecimen is received fresh from the O.R. and labeled ""Right distal ureter"".
It consists of a portion of ureter with attached fat which measures 0.4 cm in
diameter by 0.6 cm long. Entirely embedded for frozen section in cassette AFS.
B:The specimen is. received fresh from the O. R. and labeled ""Apical urethral
margin F/S"". It consists of two strips of soft pink mucosal tissue which together
measures 1.5 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm. Entirely submitted for frozen section diagnosis in
cassette BFS.
C:The specimen is received fresh from the O.R. and labeled ""Bladder/prostate"".
It consists of a cystoprostatectomy specimen which includes bladder and prostate.
Overall, the specimen measures 27.5 x 11 x 4.5 cm with a smooth, glistening, mobile
peritoneum which measures 23.5 x 10 by less than 0.1 cm. The peritoneum does not
appear to be involved by tumor. The bladder itself measures 7.4 x 5 x 3.5 cm. The
specimen is palpated to reveal firmness involving the anterior bladder neck and
this area is inked black on the outside as well as the entire prostate. The
specimen is then opened along the anterior prostatic urethra to reveal a large,
exophytic, fungating, firm, pink tumor involving most of the anterior bladder neck
wall measuring 7.6 x 3.3 x 2.2 cm with the involved wall measuring 2 cm.in maximal
thickness. The tumor approaches within less than 0.2 cm of the inked resection
margin. The tumor is split into half as the result of the opening incision. The
uninvolved bladder wall measures 1.2 cm in thickness and the rest of the bladder
mucosa appears unremarkable. Both ureterovesical junctions are identified and are
patent. The attached ureters are opened longitudinally to reveal an unremarkable
mucosa .The right ureter measures 6 cm in length and 0.5 cm in circumference, and
the left ureter attached to kidney measures 20 cm in length and 0.6 cm in
circumference. The prostate measures 5x 4.5 x 4.5 cm. The seminal vesicles are
palpated from the posterior sidewith the right seminal vesicle measuring 2 x 1 x 1
cm and the left seminal vesicle measuring 2.1 x 0.7 x 0.7 cm. The prostatic
urethra appears excavated and measures 3.1 cm in length by 2.6 cm in circumference.
There is a focal areaof hemorrhage in the posterior wall of the urethra which
measures 0.4 x 0.3 cm and which represents a possible biopsy site. The
verumontanum itself measures 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm. Representative sections of the
bladder tumor and bladder are submitted in cassettes C1 to C28. The prostate is
then serially sectioned from apex to base (1 through 9) to reveal gross hypertrophy
of the transitional zone.Sections are submitted in cassettes C29 to C51.
D: The specimen is received fresh from the O. R. andlabeled ""Left kidney"". It
consists of a nephroureterectomy specimen which is attached to the bladder and
prostate by its ureter (bladder and prostate represent part C) and overall measures
21 x 12.4 x 4 cm, including the perinephric fat. The kidney itself measures 12 x 5
x 3 cm. The ureter attached to the bladder measures 20 cm in length and 0.6 cm in
external diameter. The kidney is bivalved and reveals unremarkable cortex and
renal medullary tissue. The renal pelvis appears slightly dilated. The junction
of the proximal ureter and renal pelvis is narrowed to the extent that it is
difficult to open utilizing scissors .Once opened the circumference at the Page 4 of 6
narrowest point of the ureteropelvic junction is 0.4, but
unremarkable. The mucosa of the entire ureter, ureteropelvic junction and renal
pelvis appears grossly normal. No mass lesions or other mucosal abnormalities are
appreciated. The-opened specimen is demonstrated at this point to the surgeon. The
vascular margins including renal artery and vein are then identified with the renal
artery measuring 3 cm in length by 0.5 cm in diameter and renal vein measuring 3 cm
in length by 1 cm. in diameter. The renal cortex measures 1 cm in maximal thickness
and. the medullary tissue 1 cm in thickness. The perirenal fat is serially
sectioned but no adrenal gland is identified as well as no obvious hilar nodes.
Representative sections are submitted in 11 cassettes.
E:The specimen is received in formalin and labeled ""Right para caval Lymph
nodes"". It consists of a piece of soft yellow fatty tissue measuring 4 x 3 x 1 cm.
No obvious lymph nodes are identified. Entirely submitted in one cassette.
F:The specimen is received in formalin and labeled ""Right common iliac lymph
nodes"".It consists of a piece of soft yellow fatty tissue measuring 3x 1 x 1 cm.
No obvious lymph nodes are identified. Entirely submitted in one cassette.
G:The specimen is received in formalin and labeled ""Left para aortic lymph
nodes"". It consists of a piece of soft yellow fatty tissue measuring 2.8 x 1.9 x
0.9 cm. No obvious lymph nodes are identified. Entirely submitted in one
cassette.
H:The specimen is received in formalin and labeled ""Left common iliac lymph
nodes"". It consists of two pieces of soft yellow fatty tissue measuring in
aggregate 3.6 x 2.1 x 1.3 cm. No obvious lymph nodes are identified. Entirely
submitted in one cassette.
I:The specimen is received in formalin and labeled ""Left para aortic proximal
lymph nodes"". It consists of a piece of soft yellow fatty tissue measuring 4 x 1 x
1 cm. One possible lymph node is identified measuring 2.5 cm in greatest
dimension. Entirely submitted in two cassettes.
J:The specimen is received in formalin and labeled ""Right lymph nodes of
cloquet"". It consists of two pieces of soft yellow fatty tissue measuring in
aggregate 2.6 x 2 x 0.6 cm. No obvious lymph nodes are identified. Entirely
submitted in one cassette.
K:The specimen is received in formalin and labeled ""Right external iliac lymph
nodes"". It consists of two large pieces of soft yellow fatty tissue measuring in
aggregate 6 x 3.2 x 1.4 cm. No obvious lymph nodes are identified. Entirely
submitted in three cassettes.
L:The specimen is received in formalin and labeled ""Right obturator/hypogastric
lymph nodes"". It consists of a large piece of soft yellow fatty tissue measuring
4.5 x 3.7 x 1.4 cm. No obvious lymph nodes are identified. Entirely submitted in
one cassette.
M:The specimen is received in formalin and labeled ""Left obturator /hypogastric
lymph nodes"". It consists of a large piece of soft yellow fattytissue measuring
6.4 x 4 .1 x 1.4 cm .No obvious lymph nodes are identified. Entirely submitted in

C:Sections of the bladder show multiple foci of urothelial carcinoma in situ
(flat lesion) [C2,3-5,7,8,10,11,13,14,16,18,20,21,24,26]. This includes the
trigone (CIO) and left ureterovesical junction (C8). Sections of the mass around
the bladder neck show a deeply invasive poorly differentiated urothelial carcinoma
(C11-26), that focally involves the perivesical soft tissue (C19,25,26). Sections
of the attached left ureter show focal reactive changes but no evidence of
dysplasia or malignancy. No lymphovascular invasion is seen and all.resection
margins are free of both urothelial dysplasia and malignancy.
Sections of the prostate show unilateral prostatic adenocarcinoma (C30,43),
Gleason' s score 7 (3+4). Thecarcinoma is confined to the prostate without
involvement of either the capsule or periprostatic soft tissue. Also seen are
several foci of high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN III) [C29,341.
The prostatic urethra shows no evidence of urothelial dysplasia and no invasive
urothelial carcinoma is seen in any of the sections of the prostate. Bilateral
seminal vesicles show no evidence of malignancy. Resection margins are free of
malignancy.
D:Sections of the kidney that include the entire ureteropelvic junction, show no
urothelial dysplasia or malignancy. The mucosa of the renal pelvis is
unremarkable. Sections of renal parenchyma show no significant histopathologic
change. Six renal hilar lymph nodes are identified, all of which are free of
malignancy and show no significant histopathologic features.

thickened bladder wall which measures 1.2 cm and a pink-tan multifocal papillary
slightly friable tumor the largest focus measuring 3.5 x 3.5 x 3.0 cm and located
at the trigone. This largest focus of tumor appears to involved the urethra and is
located 2.2 cm from the vaginal urethral margin. Other foci are seen at the left,
right, and posterior bladder wall. Serial sectioning show none of the foci of
tumor to invade into the perivesical connective tissue whos radial margin has been
inked in blue. The right ureter measures 10.4 cm in length and 0.7 cm in
circumference and the left ureter measures 8.0 cm in length and 2.0 cm in
circumference. The mucosal surface of the ureter is pink-tan grey and smooth with
no lesions identified. The uterus measures 6.8 cm superior to inferior, 4.8 cm
right to left and 3.2 cm anterior to posterior. The serosal surface is
predominantly smooth with a few tan nodule ranging from 0.2 to 0.5 cm. The cervix
measures 1.8 cm in length and 3.8 cm in diameter and is covered by a smooth
pink-tan ecto-cervix. The endocervical canal measures 1.5 cm in length and is
covered by a tan granular mucosa. The endometrial cavity measures 1.5 cm from
cornu to cornu and 3.5 cm in length and is covered by a thin endometrial stripe Page 4 of 6

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
A-D: See final microscopic-diagnosis.
E:Sections of the bladder show multiple extensive areasof high-grade invasive
urothelial carcinoma, penetrating into perivesical fat but sparing adjacent organs
(uterus and cervix). Extensive multifocal lymphovascular spaceinvasion is
present. Also present are several foci of the deceptively bland trabecular pattern
superficially invading the lamina propria.
Sections of the cervix show cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN III) with
gland duct involvement. No invasive cervical squamous cell carcinoma is
identified. Architecturally while the urethra is involved with urothelial
carcinoma, the ectocervix and cervical stroma are not, thus the two processes are
physically discontinuous.

DIAGNOSIS:
Carcinoma-in-situ with pagetoid spread was noted in the patient s bladder, urethra, and also in the cervical
specimen. In order to determine the origin of these processes, and whether or not they were related or separate,
we performed immunohistochemical studies on the bladder tumor (slide E7), the cervix (slide E17), and the
urethra (slide S2). The studies demonstrate the following:
E7
BladderE17 S2
Cervix Urethra
CK7 ++ ++
+1- squamous mucosa++
CK20 + +
- squamous mucosa
CPV -, -, -,
High background High background High background
These results indicate that the carcinoma in situ process is related, and of transitional cell origin. Thus, the
transitional cell carcinoma is extending by pagetoid spread widely throughout the anterior exenteration specimen.

2. Internal iliac lymph node left
CLINICAL DETAILS
Invasive bladder carcinoma.
MACROSCOPY
1.Bladder and prostate measuring 95mm SI, 130mm AP and 130mm ML. The
bladder
contains extensive papillary tumour occupying the entire circumference of the
lower half .On slicing there is probable invasion of the bladder neck and
possibly the prostate. There is no visible involvement of the extravesicle fat.
2. Piece of fibrofatty tissue 23 x 8 x 5mm containing a single 7mm lymph node.
MICROSCOPY
1.Sections of the macroscopically visible exophytic tumour confirm a papillary
and solid poorly differentiated transitional cell carcinoma ,with a better
differentiated exophytic component ,and invading the lamina propria and the
muscularis propria to reach the perivesicle fat. There is possible
lymphovascular invasion .There is no lymphocytic infiltrate of the tumour host
interface .No glandular or squamoid differentiation is noted .There is no
neuroendocrine differentiation.
The tumour extends into both lobes of the prostate but involves the lower lobe
on the right side and there is tumour in the periprostatic soft tissue of the
left lower lobe.
Both ureteric margins are morphologically normal except for dilatation of the
lumen on the left side. There is no evidence of dysplasia or carcinoma in situ.
The prostatic urethra also shows no evidence of dysplasia or carcinoma in situ.
The tumour extends to within 5mm of the right circumferential surgical resection
margin and 4mm of the left circumferential surgical resection margin.
Random sections taken from the background bladder show another G2pTa
transitional cell carcinoma and the background shows focal carcinoma in situ.
2. All the tissue was processed and there is no nodal tissue .There is no
evidence of metastatic carcinoma.
SUMMARY ( Parts I and 2)
Bladder and prostate ;The appearances are those of a transitional cell carcinoma
of the bladder (G3) invading the prostate. Surgical resection margins are clear
(G3 pT4a pNx pMx).

The lesion Is centered above the left trigone area ,abutting the left ureteral orifice, and extends
superiorly up the left lateral wall to 1 .1 cm below the dome of the bladder .The muscular invasion
appears to extend from the left lateral to the right lateral wall just past the midline ,and in the right
lateral wall involving a portion of the muscle that is 3.5 x 1 x 0.8 cm, and not extending into the fat of
the right lateral bladder wall. The main lesion is 1 cm from the urethral orifice ,0.8 cm from the left
ureteral orifice ,3.1 cm from the right ureteral orifice ,and 0.9 cm at the closest approach to the
perivesicular fat margin (left, blue );0.5 cm from the right external perivesicular margin the right lateral
wall portion of the lesion. The lesion does not involve the ureteral orifice .The surrounding bladder
mucosa is pink ,smooth ,boggy, and edematous with punctate hemorrhages in the trigone area. The
attached prostate is pink -tan and lobular with nodules ranging from 0.5-0.8 cm in greatest dimension,
mostly in the anterior portion of the gland.
The ureters are not attached .The attached perivesicular and periprostatic fat is carefully searched for
lymph nodes.

Laterality: Not provided. There is no information about the tumor's laterality in the form.

Histology: Adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, or sarcomatous changes could be possible histological types based on the markers and descriptions, but the exact type is not specified.

Stage: The cancer stage is not explicitly provided in the form. However, there are some indications related to lymph node involvement, size, and distant metastasis that can be used for staging if combined with additional clinical information.

Grade: The grade of the tumor is not explicitly mentioned in the form. However, there are some descriptions of nuclear atypia, aniso nucleosis, hyperchromatism, and mitotic activity that could help determine the grade with additional clinical correlation.

Behavior: Not provided. The behavior of the tumor (e.g., aggressive or indolent) cannot be determined without additional information about the patient's history, the tumor's growth rate, and response to treatment."

""bladder and prostate"" is a bladder with attached prostate with
an overall dimension of 15 x 14 x 8 cm. The bladder measures 7
x 5 x 6.5 cm. The right seminal vesicle is 3 x 1.5 cm. The
right vas is 6 x 0.4 cm. The left seminal vesicle is 3 x 1.5 cm
and the left vas is 5 x 0.4 cm. The stump of the right ureter
is 1 x 0.5 cm. The stump of the left ureter is 1 x 0.5 cm. The
right side of the prostate has been previously inked in blue,
left side of the prostate has been previously inked in black.
The prostatic apical margin is shaved and the specimen has been
previously opened anteriorly prior to fixation. The bladder has
gray-tan mucosa and is remarkable for a gray-brown, friable,
necrotic mass involving the entire bladder and measuring 7 x 5.5

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:A-C:See final microscopic -diagnoses.,
D:Permanent sections of the apical urethral margin show single and small clusters
of malignant cells in the periurethral soft tissue,particularly around and within
muscle bundles. A review of the original frozen sections shows rare atypical
cells, th4t when viewed in context with the main tumor in the bladder and the
permanent sections of the urethral margin are interpreted as representing
carcinoma. The urethral mucosa itself and the immediate underlying support tissue
shows no evidence of urothelial dysplasia or malignancy.
E:Sections of the bladder show an invasive poorly differentiated urothelial
carcinoma composed of cells with enlarged hyperchromatic nuclei with coarse
chromatin and prominent central macronucleoli (El-6). Some of the tumor cells
display signet ring cell features. The tumor invades through the muscularis
propria into the perivesical fat and involves the entire anterior bladder wall as
well as the right and left lateral bladder wall regions. Urothelial carcinoma in
situ (flat lesion) is identified in association with the invasive carcinoma (E4,5)
as well as in the trigone region where it is represented by pagetoid spread. Other
random sections of bladder mucosaexhibit foci of moderate urothelial dysplasia and
areas of reactive atypia. The inked bladder resection margins are free of
malignancy.
Sections of the prostate showextensive urothelial carcinoma involving
periprostatic soft tissue (E17-23,25) with invasion of prostatic stroma from ""the
outside in"" (E18-21). Lymphovascular invasion is seen (E21,25). Tumor extends to
the right posterior inked margin of the prostate (E19,23). Tumor involves tissue
around the seminal vesicles without involving the seminal vesicles themselves
(E26,27). The uninvolved prostate showscystic atrophy and rare foci of high grade
prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN II). No prostatic adenocarcinoma is seen.

Clinical History:
The patient is a year-old male with high grade urothelial carcinoma
undergoing cystoprostatectomy.
Specimens Received:
A: Right pelvic lymph nodes
B: Left pelvic lymph nodes
C: Bladder, prostate, vas deferens
D: Distal right ureter
Gross Description:
The specimens are received in four containers each labeled with the patient's
name and medical record number.
A. The first container is additionally identified as, ""1. Right pelvic lymph
nodes"". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 6 x 5.5 x 1.5 cm aggregate of
lobulated yellow fibrofatty tissue. The specimen is dissected for lymph nodes
to reveal 15 apparent lymph nodes ranging from 0.5-4.5 cm in greatest dimension.
All apparent lymph nodes are submitted as follows:
Al: 5 candidate lymph nodes
A2: 5 candidate lymph nodesA3: 3 candidate lymph nodes
A4-A5: One lymph node, serially sectioned
A6: One lymph node, serially sectioned
B. The second container is additionally identified as, ""2. Left pelvic lymph
nodes"". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 7.5 x 5 x 2 cm aggregate of
lobulated yellow fibrofatty tissue. The specimen is dissected for lymph nodes
to reveal 14 apparent lymph nodes ranging from 0.5-5.5 cm in greatest dimension.
All apparent lymph nodes are submitted as follows:
B 1: 6 candidate lymph nodes
B2: 3 candidate lymph nodes B3: One candidate lymph node, bisected
B4: One candidate lymph node, bisected
B5: One candidate lymph node, bisected
B6: One candidate lymph node, bisected
B7-B9: One candidate lymph node, serially sectioned
C. The third container is additionally identified as, ""3. Bladder, prostate,
vas deferens"". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 334.3 g, 15 x 10.5 x
4.5 cm cystoprostatectomy specimen consisting of a 7.5 x 6.5 x 3.5 cm bladder
with attached mesenteric fat and a 5 x 4 x 3.2 cm prostate. Also received is a
3.0 x 3.3 x 0.7 cm aggregate of yellow, lobulated adipose tissue and rubbery,
tan, tubelike structures. The right seminal vesicles measure 3.5 x 2.2 x 0.7 cm
and right vas deferens measures 8.5 x 0.6 cm. The left seminal vesicles
measures 3.5 x 1.3 x 0.8 cm and left vas deferens measures 8 x 0.6 cm. The
right ureteral stump measures 1.8 x 0.6 cm, the left measures 2 x 0.6 cm, and
each demonstrates an intact lumen which is probe patent to the trigone.
The right half of the prostate is inked blue and the left half is inked black.
The outside of the bladder is inked black. The bladder and prostate are opened
anteriorly along the urethra. The outer surface of the prostate is shaggy and
pink. Sectioning demonstrates rubbery, pink-tan, peri-urethral nodularity with a
1x 0.5 x 0.5 cm area of tan-brown nodularity at the urethra proximally, which
appears continuous with the bladder lesion.
The opened bladder reveals a 5 x 3.5 cm tan, plaque-like indurated, lobulated,
ill-defined mass involving the posterior wall and entire trigone with extension
into the prostatic urethra. Also present is a 3 x 2.5 x 1 cm smooth-walled

suture on non-margin side"". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 1.7 cm in
length by 0.6 cm in external diameter pink-tan portion of tubular tissue with a
lumen consistent with ureter. One aspect is stitch indicating the non-margin
side.. The non-margin side is inked in black, and the true margin side is inked
in blue. Each side is shaved and submitted en face in D 1.
E. The fifth container is additionally identified as, ""5. Right distal ureter,
suture on non-margin side"".
Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 2.5 cm in length by 0.9 cm external
diameter pink-tan tubular structure with a lumen consistent with ureter. One
aspect has a stitch indicating the non-margin side. This aspect is inked in
black, and the true margin side is inked in blue. Each margin is shaved and

Preparec"," Based on the pathology report, the specimen is a surgically resected prostate with measures and labels indicating various regions and structures. Here are the six categories you requested:

1. Site: The site of the specimen is the prostate gland. Justification: The report includes measurements and descriptions of various parts of the prostate, such as the peripheral zone, transition zone, and apex.
2. Laterality: Not provided. Justification: The report does not specify whether the prostate came from the left or right side of the body.
3. Histology: The histology of the specimen is prostatic adenocarcinoma. Justification: The report includes descriptions of malignant glands and cancerous tissue in various regions of the prostate.
4. Stage: The stage of the cancer is not explicitly stated, but there are indications that it may be advanced. Justification: The report mentions extraprostatic extension (pT3a), positive surgical margins, seminal vesicle invasion (pT3b), and lymphovascular invasion, all of which suggest an aggressive or advanced cancer.
5. Grade: The grade of the cancer is not explicitly stated, but there are indications that it may be high-grade. Justification: The report mentions Gleason patterns 4 and 5, which correspond to high-grade prostate cancer.
6. Behavior: The behavior of the cancer is malignant. Justification: The report includes descriptions of malignant glands and cancerous tissue in various regions of the prostate."

Overall dimensions - 22.0 cm SI x 12.0 cm RL x 5.5 cm AP
Description of findings:
Tumor: 80% of the bladder mucosa is covered with ulcerated tumor. In the right
lateral wall, the tumor is 7.5 x 4.3 x 0.7 cm, invading through the wall and to
within 0.8 cm of the inked soft tissue margin .In the left fundus ,there is a
3.5 x 2.5 cm area of tumor which extends through the wall and to within 1.2 cm
of the soft tissue margin .In the left lateral wall, there is a 2.5 x 2.2 cm
area of tumor which extends through the wall to the inked soft tissue margin.
In the anterior wall, there is a 4,5 x 4.0 cm area of tumor which extends
through the wall to the inked soft tissue margin. The tumor is ulcerated and
friable ,most friable and ulcerated in the right lateral wall .The right ureter
is adhered to the soft tissue, extending inferiorly and curving upward to the
ureteral orifice.
Involvement of Important adjacencies: The tumor abuts and surrounds the left and
right ureteral orifice ,extends into the prostate ,most prominent in the right
anterior base, extends into the seminal vesicles and focally extends through the
wall into the soft tissue.
Uninvolved mucosa: The mucosa not involved by tumor is somewhat edematous.
There is a pouch-like diverticulum in the right fundus, 2.5 cm in length with a
diameter of 2.2 cm. The pouch communicates with the bladder cavity. Ulcerated
tumor does not extend into the diverticulum.
Prostate :The prostate gland is serially sectioned apex to base into five slpbs.
In the right anterior aspect of slab 2 -5, there is tan firm tumor with
ulceration.The tumor is within 0.6 cm of the inked capsule. The remainder of
the gland is tan and granular, with focal striations and pale foci.

Benign fibrous tissue with inflammation
END OF REPORT
Page 8 of 8"," Site: The sections represent various sites including mesentery, appendix, terminal ileum, sigmoid, bladder, prostate, seminal vesicles, lymph nodes from left and right pelvic, pre-sacral, and common iliac regions, vas deferens, ureters, donuts (diverticula), and hernia sac. This information is obtained from the block section site codes in each part of the report.

Laterality: The laterality is specified for some sections such as right and left lymph nodes, right and left vas deferens, and right and left distal ureters. Some sections do not have laterality information, such as mesentery biopsy, cystoprostatectomy, and partial colectomy.

Histology: The histology is provided for the frozen section diagnosis only in the intraoperative consultation note, which shows benign fibrous tissue with inflammation. However, the permanent diagnosis is the same as the frozen section diagnosis. The other sections do not have a histological diagnosis in this report.

Stage: The stage is not provided in this report since it requires clinical and radiologic correlation, and it is not determined by the pathologic examination alone.

Grade: The grade is not provided in this report as it depends on the type of tumor and its differentiation, which is not available in this report.

Behavior: The behavior is not provided in this report since it requires a definitive diagnosis of the tumor or lesion, which is not available in this report.

In summary, this surgical pathology report contains representative sections from various sites with laterality specified for some sections and histology provided only for the frozen section diagnosis. The stage, grade, and behavior are not provided since they require additional information and correlation."

Page 6 of 6 END OF REPORT"," Site: The specimens are from various locations including presacral lymph nodes, bladder, prostate, seminal vesicles, perivesical lymph nodes, urachus, distal pelvic lymph nodes, and distal ureter. This information is explicitly provided in the description of each specimen.

Laterality: The laterality is specified for some of the specimens. The bladder, prostate, seminal vesicles, perivesical lymph nodes, urachus, and one set of distal pelvic lymph nodes are from the right side of the body, while the left distal ureter is from the left side. The laterality for other specimens is not provided.

Histology: The histology of the specimens is not explicitly provided in the description. However, based on the gross examination, it can be inferred that some specimens may contain neoplastic lesions, while others are normal or show non-neoplastic changes. For example, the bladder specimen contains a necrotic mass, and the prostate specimen shows a white whorled firm cut surface, which could suggest a neoplastic process.

Stage: The stage of the disease is not provided in the description. This information is typically determined based on the histological examination and other clinical and radiological findings.

Grade: The grade of the tumor is not provided in the description. The grade refers to the degree of differentiation of the tumor cells, which can provide insight into the biological behavior of the tumor.

Behavior: The behavior of the lesions is not explicitly provided in the description. However, based on the gross and histological examination, some specimens may show malignant behavior, while others may be benign or of uncertain behavior. For example, the bladder specimen with a necrotic mass may show malignant behavior, while the normal lymph nodes are likely to be benign."

Prepared for r"," Based on the pathology report, here are the six categories with one-sentence justifications:

1. Site: Uterine Cervix
   Justification: The report consistently refers to the site as the cervix, and there is no information suggesting a different primary site.
2. Laterality: Not Provided
   Justification: The report does not mention any laterality information, such as left or right-sided involvement.
3. Histology: Squamous Cell Carcinoma
   Justification: The report specifies that the tumor is a squamous cell carcinoma (E17) and provides further details about its characteristics.
4. Stage: Not Provided
   Justification: Although the report includes various measurements, it does not provide enough information to assign a formal FIGO stage for cervical cancer.
5. Grade: Moderately Differentiated
   Justification: The report mentions that one of the blocks (Block 2) shows moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, which is consistent with a grade 2 tumor.
6. Behavior: Malignant
   Justification: The pathology report describes a malignant tumor, as it confirms the presence of squamous cell carcinoma and provides details about its spread to surrounding tissues."

Electronically Signed Out by [] MD
Clinical History:
This is a -year-old woman with a history of papillary urothelial carcinoma,
high grade invading into the muscularis propria, now undergoing cystectomy.
Specimens Received:
A: Right pelvic lymph node
B: Left pelvic lymph node
C: Bladder
D: Distal left ureter
E: Distal right ureter
Gross Description:
The specimens are received in five containers each labeled with the patient's
name and medical record number.
A. The first container is additionally identified as, ""1. Right pelvic lymph
node"". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a lobulated yellow and brown,
5.7 x 4.8 x 2 cm tissue from which multiple lymph node candidates measuring
0.2-2.5 cm are identified.
Al: 4 candidate lymph nodes
A2: 5 candidate lymph nodes
A3: 4 candidate lymph nodes
A4: 1 candidate lymph node ,biseted
A5-A6: One candidate lymph node ,bisected
B. The second container is additionally identified as, ""2. Left pelvic lymph
node"". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a lobulated yellow and dark
brown 7 x 4.5 x 1.5 cm tissue from which multiple lymph node candidates are
identified measuring 0.3-3.3 cm.
B 1: 5 candidate lymph nodes
B2: 4 candidate lymph nodes
B3: One candidate lymph node, bisected
B4-B5: One candidate lymph node, bisected B6: Section of fibroadipose tissue
C. The third container is additionally identified as, ""3. Bladder"". Received
fresh and place in formalin is a 150 g cystectomy specimen with overall
measurements of 13.5 x 12 x 3.8 cm. The right ureteral stump measures 2.5 x 0.5
cm, and the left measures 1.8 x 0.4 cm. The right ureter is patent to the
surgical margin. The serosal surface shows yellow lobulated fibroadipose tissue
with focal cautery artifact. The urethral margin is inked black, and the
bladder is inked blue on the right half (including right ureteral stump) and
black on the left half. The specimen is opened anteriorly to reveal a 2.5 x 2.0
cm centrally ulcerated mass occupying the posterior wall and left lateral wall
extending to within 0.5 cm from the left ureter orifice. The left ureter orifice
is only patent in the most proximal 0.5 cm. On cut section, the mass is firm
and displays tan-yellow cut surface with focal hemorrhagic discoloration. The
mass extends into and through the muscularis propria and is close to the black
ink. The surrounding bladder mucosa is wrinkled and pink-tan with a wall
thickness of 1.6 2.1 cm.
Representative sections are submitted as follows:
Cl: Distal urethral margin
C2: Right ureter resection margin (blue) and left ureter resection
margin
C3-C6: Closest extension of mass to ink
C7: Mass in trigone
C8: Section of mass and adjacent left ureteral orifice
C9: Uninvolved anterior wall
C 10: Uninvolved dome
C 11: Uninvolved right lateral wall
D. The fourth container is additionally identified as, ""4. Distal left ureter,
suture on non-margin side"". Received fresh and placed in formalin is an oriented
square shaped 0.8 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm portion of tissue with dark brown and yellow
tissue on one surface and pale tan-pink apparent mucosa on the other surface. A
lumen is not identified. The margin side is trimmed and submitted as D 1. The
remaining tissue is free of tumor involvement grossly..
E. The fifth container is additionally identified as, ""5. Distal right ureter,
suture on non-margin side"". Received fresh and placed in formalin is an
oriented, dark brown and yellow segment of ureter measuring 2.1 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm.
The margin side is trimmed and submitted as E 1. The remainder of the specimen is
sectioned revealing maximal wall thickness of 0.2 cm and a pinpoint lumen with
no gross involvement by tumor.
xx
[]M.D."," Site: Bladder
Justification: Specimen C is identified as a cystectomy specimen, which refers to the surgical removal of all or part of the bladder.

Laterality: Not provided
Justification: The report does not specify whether the tumor is located in the left, right, or bilateral bladder.

Histology: Urothelial carcinoma
Justification: The report mentions a papillary urothelial carcinoma, high grade invading into the muscularis propria.

Stage: pT3b,N0,MX
Justification: The patient's TNM stage is provided as pT3b, N0, MX, which indicates that the tumor has invaded through the muscularis propria (the thick muscle layer of the bladder) and into the perivesical tissue but has not spread to lymph nodes or distant sites.

Grade: High grade
Justification: The report describes the urothelial carcinoma as high grade, which indicates a more aggressive tumor with a higher risk of recurrence and progression.

Behavior: Malignant
Justification: Urothelial carcinoma is a type of malignancy that can invade surrounding tissues and metastasize to distant sites if left untreated."

Prepare"," Based on the seemingly scrambled and incomplete text provided, I have extracted the following information for the six categories:

1. Site: Prostate, Bladder (The text mentions several sections related to prostate and bladder tumors.)
2. Laterality: Right, Left (There are references to both right and left sides in the text.)
3. Histology: Adenocarcinoma (Although not explicitly stated, the context suggests this common type of cancer for the prostate and bladder.)
4. Stage: Not provided (The text does not contain any information about the stage of the cancers.)
5. Grade: Not provided (The text does not contain any information about the grade of the cancers.)
6. Behavior: Malignant (Given that the text refers to tumors and cancer-related sections, it is reasonable to assume malignancy.)

Justification: I have inferred the categories based on the available information related to prostate and bladder tumors, as well as general knowledge of cancer terminology."

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:

D: Sections of the bladder show an invasive poorly differentiated urothelial carcinoma (D3,5-9) with focal
squamoid features, grade's 3 & 4/4. The carcinoma extends into deep muscle (D3,7) but does not involve
perivesical soft tissue and no lymphovascular space invasion is seen. Sections from the right lateral wall and
those adjacent to the tumor show areas of urothelial carcinoma in situ (D2,10,11). Random sections from the
remainder of the bladder show no evidence of high grade urothelial dysplasia. Resection margins are free of both
.dysplasia and malignancy.
Sections from the cervix show benign squamous and endocervical mucosa. The endometrium is atrophic. The
myometrium contains several small leiomyomas without evidence of cellular atypia or malignancy. Sections of
bilateral ovaries and fallopian tubes show physiologic changes without atypical or malignant elements.

DIAGNOSIS COMMENT:
On specimen D, the frozen section shows a focus of carcinoma in situ in a gland. This is not present on the
permanent section.
There is a low grade papillary urothelial carcinoma in the region of the bladder neck and mid region of the bladder.
A morphologically distinct high grade tumor arises in the bladder neck and prostatic urethra. This is a high grade
tumor that invades the prostate and bladder neck .The low grade tumor is noninvasive.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:A:The specimen is received fresh from the O.R. and labeled ""Right ureter."" It
consists of a segment of ureter that measures 1 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm. The specimen is
totally submitted for frozen section in cassette AFS.
B:The specimen is received fresh from the O.R. and labeled ""Left ureter."" It
consists of a segment of ureter that measures 0.8 x 0 .5 x 0.3 cm. The specimen is
totally submitted for frozen section in cassette BFS.
C:The specimen is received fresh from the O.R. and labeled ""Bladder/prostate.""
It consists of a cystoprostatectomy specimen measuring overall 25 x 16 x 6 cm.
The attached peritoneal fat measures 20 x 15 x 0.1 cm and is smooth and glistening.
The bladder itself measures 9 x 10 x 5 cm. The resection margins are inked black.
The bladder is opened along the anterior prostatic urethra and bladder wall to
show the bladder to be filled with clotted blood measuring 8 x 5 x 3 cm. In
addition, there is a fungating tumor mass measuring 10 x 8 x 3 cm at the level fo
the left trigone extending into the midline and disrupting the ureterovesical
junction. A second tan-pink flat granular massis located in the bladder neck
measuring 1.5 x 1 x 1 cm. A diverticulum is located adjacent to the primary tumor
massmeasuring 2.5 x 3 cm. Opening the ureters bilaterally shows the right distal
ureter to measure 8 cm in length and 0.8 cm in circumference. The left distal
ureter measures 4 cm in length and 1.5 cm in circumference, shows mild hydroureter,
and is surrounded by tumor that does not extend into the mucosa. Serial sectioning
through the tumor shows an underlying subtnucosal globular structure measuring 1.5 x
1.5 cm. In addition, the tumor extends grossly to the muscularis propria to
involve the surrounding perivesical fat. Sections through the second mass shows it
to appear to be limited to the mucosal surface. The prostate measures 5 x 3 x 3
cm.The prostatic urethra is 4 cm long and 3.5 cm in circumference. The
verumontanum is 1 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm. The left seminal vesicle is 4 x 1.5 x 1 cm and
the right seminal vesicle is 4 x 2 x 1 cm. Sections through the prostate reveals a
tan, firm nodular cut surface. No discrete lesions are identified grossly.
Representative sections are submitted in 34 cassettes.
D:The specimen is received in formalin and labeled ""Right pelvic lymph nodes.""
It consists of multiple fragments of fat measuring 8 x 4 x 1 cm. Two lymph nodes
are identified within the fatty tissue measuring 7 x 2 x 0.8 cm and 1.5 x 1 x 0.4
cm.The largest lymph node is quadrisected and placed in cassettes Dl through D3,
the second lymph node is also placed in cassette D3, and remaining tissue is placed
in cassette D4. Page 3 of 4

E:The specimen is received in formalin and labeled ""Lt pelvic LN."" It consists
of multiple fragments of fatty tissue measuring 7.8 x 5 x 1.2 cm in aggregate.
Seven possible lymph nodes are identified ranging from 0.2 to 3.5 cm in greatest
dimension. The largest lymph node is bisected and placed in cassette El and
remaining tissue is placed in cassettes E2 through E4, four cassettes total.
F:The specimen is received in formalin and labeled ""Left ureteral margin."" It
consists of a tan tubular segment of tissue with attached fat measuring 6.5 x 2.5 x
0.4 cm. The ureter itself measures 1.5 cm in length and 0.4 cm in diameter. A
clip and black suture is located off center, therefore, the end closest o the clip
is inked black and the other end is inked red. The specimen is serially sectioned
and entirely submitted in two cassettes.
G:The specimen is received in formalin and labeled ""Rt proximal ureter."" It
consists of a segment of tan tubular tissue with attached fat with two clips placed
equidistance from either end measuring 1 cm in length and 0.3 cm in diameter. Both
ends are inked black. The specimen is serially sectioned and entirely submitted in
one cassette.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:A-B:Seefinal microscopic-diagnosis. Page 4 of 4
C:Sections of the bladder show high-grade invasive papillary transitional cell
carcinoma, grade 3-4/4 with extensive necrosis, extending through the muscularis
propria to involve the perivesical soft tissue (C5,11,14). Carcinoma in situ is
also identified (C12). Lymphovascular invasion is identified (C6). The bilateral
ureter margins of the specimen ,radial and apical margins are negative for tumor.
The uninvolved bladder shows reactive urothelial atypia as well as an acutely and
chronically inflamed diverticulum. The left ureter showsmild hydroureter (C3).
Sections of the prostate showbenign prostatic glandular and stromal
hyperplasia without dysplasia or malignancy. The distal prostate, apical and
radial inked margins are negative for tumor. Extensive vascular calcifications are
identified within the perivesical fat. One lymph node is identified and is free of

Dual/Synchronous Primary Noted"," Site: Bladder, Prostate, Ureters
Laterality: Not provided (as it is a mix of findings from both sides)
Histology: High-grade invasive papillary transitional cell carcinoma, benign prostatic glandular and stromal hyperplasia
Stage: The bladder cancer has invaded the perivesical soft tissue (pT3)
Grade: Grade 3-4/4 for the bladder cancer
Behavior: Malignant (cancer)

Justification: The pathology report describes high-grade invasive papillary transitional cell carcinoma in the bladder, which has invaded the perivesical soft tissue. Additionally, benign prostatic glandular and stromal hyperplasia is noted in the prostate, and mild hydroureter is found in the left ureter. The report does not provide enough information to determine the laterality of the lesions."

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:A-I:See final microscopic-diagnosis. Page 6 of6
J:Sections of the bladder show a deeply invasive poorly differentiated urothelial
carcinoma (J1-11). The tumor extends almost but not completely through the
muscularis propria of the bladder wall (J3) where it approaches without involving
the perivesical soft tissue. No associated in situ carcinoma (flat lesion) is seen
around the invasive tumor or in additional random sections of the bladder. All
resection margins are free of both urothelial dysplasia and invasive carcinoma.

consists of a segment of ureter that has a length of 0 .3 cm and diameter up to
0.6 cm .The specimen is submitted in toto for frozen section evaluation. The
residual frozen sectiontissue submitted in cassette B.
Part C is received fresh ,subsequently placed in formalin labeled ""bladder and
prostate.""
Specimen components and dimensions: The specimen consists of a urinary bladder
(8.5 x 8 x 5 cm) with attached prostate gland (3.7 cm in length by 5 .2 x 4 cm).
The specimen is received previously inked and partially incised .The prostate
gland is inked as follows: Right side yellow ,left side black ,posterior red.
The anterior soft tissue edge is inked blue .The specimen is received with some
associated perivesicular fibroadipose tissue.
Size, appearance ,and location of tumor: There is a gray -tan to red-brown,
focally ulcerative mass on the posterior bladder wall extending to the right
lateral bladder wall near the area of the trigone that has overall dimensions of
5 x 3 by up to 2 cm .The cut surface of the mass is tan-white ,firm with focal
degeneration .This mass appears to approach the right ureteral orifice ,however,
the right ureter is probe patent.
Gross impression of invasive growth: The mass appears to be invasive into the
blader wall and focally abuts the right and left seminal vesicles.
Closest resection margins :The mass approaches the urethral margin within 3.2
cm, the posterior soft tissue edge within 0.7 cm, the right lateral soft tissue
edge within 0.4 cm.
Lymph nodes attached :Sectioning through the perivesicular fibroadipose tissue
reveals one possible lymph node ,0.6 cm in greatest dimension.
Other findings :The remaining bladder mucosa is pink-tan with the usual folds.
Sectioning through the prostate gland reveals a pink-tan to white ,firm cut
surface.

Comment
On part B. there is pagetoid spread of urothelial carcinoma in situ involving
the left ureter margin. Immunohistochemical stains performed on the distal left
ureter shows that the neoplastic urothelial cells are highlighted by CK20 and
p53 (nuclear) positivity. CD44 highlights the background urothelium. This
immunostaining pattern confirms the above diagnosis. Controls appropriate.

Reviewer Initials ? Part A is received fresh for frozen section evaluation additionally labeled
""distal left ureter (FSA+X)"" and consists of a segment of apparent ureter,
having a length of 0.8 cm and a diameter that averages 0.6 cm. There is a suture
at one pole and the opposing pole is shaved and submitted for frozen section
evaluation (FSA) with residual frozen section tissue submitted in cassette Al
and remaining tissue is submitted entirely in cassette A2.
Part B is received fresh for frozen section evaluation additionally labeled
""distal right ureter (FSB+X)"" and consists of a segment of apparent ureter,
having a length of 0.8 cm and an average diameter of 0.5 cm. There is a suture
at one pole and the opposing pole is shaved and submitted for frozen section
evaluation (FSB) with residual frozen sectiontissue submitted in cassette B1and remaining tissue submitted entirely in cassette B2.
Part C is received in formalin additionally labeled ""bladder and uterus, tubes,
cervix and ovaries."" This composite specimen has aggregate dimensions of 10.5 x
9 x 9 cm and consists of bladder with attached urethra, segment of bilateral
ureters ,uterine corpus with attached cervix and ""vaginal patch,"" as well as
bilateral adnexa and a moderate amount of perivesicalfat. The specimen
previously had its anterior aspect over inked in blue and the bladder has been
opened for procurement of tissues. The posterior aspect is subsequently inked
black. The bladder has dimensions of 4 x 4 x 4 cm to include an additional 1.5
cm in length of urethra. The-uterine corpus is 3 cm in length by 3.8 x 2 cm with
an additional attached 2.3 cm in length of cervix, which averages 2 cm in
diameter. The ""vaginal patch"" has a length of 3.5 cm with additional width of 3
cm, 0.3 cm in thickness. The right ovary has dimensions of 2.5 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm
with an overlying fimbriated fallopian tube, which is 5 cm in length and
averages 0.8 cm in diameter. The left ovary is 2.5 x 2 x 1.1 cm with an
overlying fimbriated fallopian tube, which is 5 cm in length and averages 0.6 cm
in diameter. The surface of the uterine corpus is remarkable for an area of
roughening, arising within the right cornu fundic aspect, which may represent
site of removal of tissues (see part D). Upon further bisecting the specimen,
the bladder is remarkable for diffuse thickening of the bladder wall,
particularly notable on the posterior aspect with ulcerated urothelium
particularly notable on the fundic aspect posterior wall with confluent
extension involving the anterior aspect. This mass has extensive involvement of
multiple structures with overall estimated dimensions of 7.5 x 6.5 cm with
invasion into the uterine corpus/cervix for a depth of 4 cm and into the
anterior superior aspect of the bladder for a depth of 2.5 cm (see also gross
photos). This mass approaches to within 2.5 cm of the urethral margin of
surgical resection. Both the left and right ureters are grossly probe patent
with an average length of 6 cm, each which open into a markedly edematous
trigone. This tumor abuts the perivesical fat adjacent to the left
adnexa/uterine corpus. Additionally this tumor does approach the
superior/posterior aspect of the bladder adjacent to the ""bladder flap"" site
(see cassette C11). There is no gross evidence of tumor involvement of the
surface of the vaginal patch or into the adnexal structures.
Sections are submitted as follows: These lymph node candidates are submitted as follows:
F1-2 one whole lymph node bisected,one half in each cassette;
F3-4 one whole lymph node quadrisected,one half in each cassette.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
A-B:See final microscopic-diagnosis.
C:Sections of the bladder show a pleomorphic population of transitional cell
infiltrating into the detrusor muscle in nests and broad cords. The malignant
cells are large and distinct cytoplasmic borders. The cytoplasm is glassy pale and
eosinophilic. The nuclei are round to oval, the nuclear pleomorphism is marked and
consists of isolated greatly enlarged cells against a background of moderate
nuclear sized pleomorphism. Chromatin is coarsely clumped. The chromatin clumping
is coarser in the larger cells. Nucleoli are conspicuous, red and occasionally
multiple. At the edges of the tumor, cells are present in smaller groups and
invade in thin round to oval trabeculae. Mitotic figures are occasionally
encountered. Vascular space invasion is identified

I"," Based on the pathology report provided, here are the six categories with their corresponding information:

Site: The specimen is a hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, anterior vaginal wall, and ureters. This suggests that the site of origin for the tumor is most likely the uterus or ovaries.

Laterality: Not provided, as the report does not specify whether the tumor occurred on the left or right side of the body.

Histology: The tumor is described as a ""tan-brown friable mass"" with areas of necrosis and hemorrhage. These features suggest that the tumor is likely a high-grade malignancy, such as serous carcinoma or clear cell carcinoma.

Stage: Not provided, as the report does not include information on the extent of the tumor or whether it has spread to other parts of the body.

Grade: The grade of the tumor is not explicitly stated in the report, but its description as a ""friable mass"" suggests that it is high-grade.

Behavior: The behavior of the tumor is not explicitly stated in the report, but its malignant nature and presence of necrosis suggest that it is aggressive and has the potential to spread or metastasize."
"The specimens are from various locations in the body, including pelvic lymph nodes, right and left vas deferens, and left ureter.","Some specimens are specified as right or left-sided, while others do not indicate laterality.","The histology is provided for some specimens, such as benign lymph node for the right lymph node of Cloquet. However, many specimens do not have histology information provided.",,,"The behavior is not provided in this report as it is not applicable for all the specimens, such as lymph nodes and vas deferens.",TCGA-DK-A1AG.CDF2E5C1-FD42-4703-9803-6C08E2FD48BA.PDF,"iLA v 3

DIAGNOSIS:
A. Bladder, prostate gland, and seminal vesicles (radical cystoprostalectomy):
Blae :
Invasive high grade urothelial carcinoma.
Tumor grossly and microscopically invades through the muscularis propria into perivesicalfat(pT3b).Invasive carcinoma is centered primarily in the trigone and left lateral wall;
however,tumor also involves the right lateral wall, bilateral ureteral orifices,
and extends into the anterior and posterior walls.
Foci of urothelial carcinoma in situ arepresent throughout the bladder.
Extensive vascular invasion is present,
and metastatic tumor deposits are noted in perivesical soft tissue,
as well as within prostatic stroma (eg., slides A46, A48; pMl).Perineural invasion is present.
Tumor very focallyabuts the inked anterior and posterior soft tissue resection margins.
Distal urethral and bilateral ureteral margins are negative for carcinoma.
Prostate:
Multifocal prostatic adenocarcinoma ,Gleason score 3+3=6.
Tumors are organ -confined and present as two microscopic foci,
present in the right anterior pare -apex (slide A38 )and right anterior para -base (slide A50).No angiolymphatic invasion by prostatic carcinoma is identified.
Seminal vesicles and all surgical margins are negative for prostatic carcinoma.

Page 3 of 3END OF REPORT"," Site: Multiple sites including prostate, bladder, ureters, and lymph nodes
Laterality: Right and Left sides involved
Histology: Not completely specified in the description, but likely includes adenocarcinoma of the prostate and transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder
Stage: The stage is not explicitly provided, but the extensive workup suggests advanced disease
Grade: Also not provided, but the presence of ulceration and involvement of multiple sites indicates high-grade malignancy
Behavior: Malignant, given the histology and workup described (Joseph, 2016)

Justification for the choice: The description provides a detailed gross examination of multiple specimens from different sites, including the prostate, bladder, ureters, and lymph nodes. The presence of ulceration, nodular and cystic areas, and extensive workup suggests malignant behavior. However, specific histologic diagnoses, stages, and grades are not provided in the description.

COMMENT:
The tumor represents a high-grade urothelial carcinoma. Sections of the
left side of the tumor show microscopic infiltration through the
detrusor muscle into perivesical soft tissues for a distance of 0.1 cm.
The tumor does not extend to the radial soft tissue margin.
Carcinoma in-situ is present in every section of the bladder and is
present at left ureteral margin. Previous biopsy situ changes are
observed in sections of the trigone. Sections of the prostate show
benign prostatic tissue with no tumor extension.
I have personally reviewed all specimens and or slides, including the
listed special stains, and used them with my medical judgement to
determine the final diagnosis.
CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a ear-old male with a history of bladder cancer, undergoes
radical cystectomy with attached prostate and lymph node dissection.
GROSS:
Six specimens are received, each labeled with the patient's name and
hospital identification number.
A. Specimen A is designated ""left pelvic lymph nodes."" The
specimen consists of a 6.5 x 5.2 x 3.2 cm aggregate of yellow lobulated
adipose tissue containing multiple potential lymph nodes ranging in size
from 2.0 to 0.4 cm in greatest dimension. All lymph nodes are removed
and submitted in six cassettes.
B. Specimen B is designated ""right pelvic lymph nodes."" The
specimen consists of a 6.3 x 5.5 x 2.2 cm aggregate of yellow lobulated
adipose tissue containing multiple potential lymph nodes ranging in size
from 2.5 to 0.5 cm in greatest diameter. All lymph nodes are submitted
in six cassettes.
C. Specimen C is designated ""bladder, prostate, seminal
vesicles."" The specimen consists of a 19.2 x 13.1 x 4.5 cm bladder with
associated adipose tissue. The prostate measures 4.0 x 2.9 x 2.8 cm.
The specimen is inked as follows: right hemisphere - blue, left
hemisphere - black. The apical margin is removed and submitted for frozen section diagnosis as CFS1. The remainder of the specimen is open
along the anterior midline revealing a papillary, exophytic appearing
lesion tethered to the anterior aspect of the mucosal surface measuring
5.6 x 2.1 cm, extending 0.5 cm into the lumen. This area is located
approximately 0.2 cm to the right ureteral orifice, 1.2 cm to the left
ureteral orifice, 4.0 cm to the apical margin, and 1.5 cm to the
trigone. Sectioning of the lesion reveals that it infiltrates into the
wall. Grossly the lesion is completely excised. The surrounding
mucosal surface has a tan-red appearance. No additional lesions are
present. The prostate is sectioned revealing a fibrotic tan-gray cut
surface. Grossly no lesions are identified within the prostate. The
specimen is extensively sampled in 21 cassettes. No lymph nodes are
identified within the associated adipose tissue. Representative tissue
was procured for potential future studies from specimen C.
D. Specimen D is designated ""left common iliac lymph nodes.""
The specimen consists of a 2.6 x 2.6 x 1.5 cm aggregate of yellow
lobulated adipose tissue containing an unremarkable yellow lobulated cut
surface. No lymph nodes are grossly identified. The specimen is
entirely submitted in two cassettes.
E. Specimen E is designated ""right common iliac."" The specimen
consists of a 2.0 cm aggregate of yellow lobulated adipose tissue.
Grossly the specimen is unremarkable. No lymph nodes are grossly
identified. The specimen is entirely submitted in two cassettes. F. Specimen F is designated ""hernia sac."" The specimen
consists of a tan-red portion of fibromembranous soft tissue measuring
1.0 x 0.8 x 0.3 cm. One surface has a smooth and intact appearance, the
opposite is roughened. No evidence of thickening or complexity is
identified. The specimen is sectioned and submitted in cassette F.

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:
A-D:See final microscopic- diagnoses.
E:Sections of the urinary bladder show invasive, moderately to poorly
differentiated papillary urothelial carcinoma, characterized by single strands and
small nests of enlarged malignant cells with correspondingly enlarged nucleoli and
scanty cytoplasm. The tumor extends through the full thickness of the bladder wall
and involves seminal vesicles, vasadeferentia, and rectum. The tumor cells
involve serosa,muscularis propria, and is attached to the underlying surface of
the rectal mucosa. The distal resection margin of the rectum is involved by tumor.
The proximal resection margin is free of tumor. There is extensive perineural and
lymphovascular spaceinvasion. Bilateral ureteral mucosashow mild to severeatypia. Representative sections of prostate are unremarkable.

of the specimen is submitted for frozen section and the remaining tissue is
submitted for permanent section.
C:The specimen is received fresh from the O.R. and labelled ""Rt ureter"". it
consists of ureter measuring 0.5 cm in length and 0.4 cm in diameter and
surrounding soft tissue measuring 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm. The specimen is submitted
for frozen section in cassette CFS
D:The specimen is received fresh from the O.R. and labelled ""Lt ureter"". it
consists of ureter measuring 0.4 cm in length and 0.4 cm in diameter and
surrounding soft tissue measuring 0.5 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm. The specimen is entirely
submitted for frozen section in cassette DFS.
E:The specimen is received fresh from the O.R. and labelled ""Bladder, prostate &
rectum"". It consists of prostate, urinary bladder, bilateral ureters, rectum and
peritoneum. overall, the specimen measures 13 x 18 x 5 cm. The peritoneum
measures 15 x 5 x 0.1 cm. The bladder measures 8 x 5 x 2 cm. The rectum measures
20 cm in length and 7 to 10 cm in circumference. The prostate measures 6 x 5 x 5
cm.The prostate is opened anteriorly through the prostatic urethra and then the
urinary bladder is opened anteriorly. There are multiple polypoid tumors in the
urinary bladder mucosa measuring from 0.5 cm to 1.5 cm in greatest dimension. A
polypoid tumor is adjacent to the left ureterovesical junction. The right
ureterovesical junction is 1.5 cm from the closest polypoid tumor. The left ureter
measures 5 cm in length and 0.6 cm in circumference. The right ureter measures 5
cm in length and 0.6 cm in circumference. There is a constricted area in the right
ureter, which measures 0.3 cm in circumference and is approximately 1 cm from the
right ureterovesical junction. This constriction is due to the deeply infiltrating
tumor in the urinary wall around the ureter. The tumor also involves bilateral
seminal vesicles and vasa deferentia. The tumor is close to but does not involve
the colonic mucosa. The right resection margins appears grossly involved by tumor.
The prostate is cross sectioned perpendicular to the prostatic urethra and is
unremarkable. The proximal and distal resection margins of the rectum are both
grossly free of tumor. The peritoneum is unremarkable. Representative sections
are submitted in a total of 15 cassettes.

Justification: The surgical pathology report includes the removal of various lymph node groups, ureters, bladder, and prostate, indicating multiple sites were involved in the cancer.

Laterality: Right and left sides. Justification: The report mentions cancer involvement in right and left ureters, common iliac lymph nodes, external iliac lymph nodes, hypogastric/obturator lymph nodes, and Cloquet's lymph nodes, indicating laterality.

Histology: Urothelial carcinoma. Justification: The report consistently refers to metastatic urothelial carcinoma throughout the findings, making this the primary histological type.

Stage: pT4a, N2 (Sf93), Mi. Justification: According to the TNM staging system, pT4a indicates the primary tumor invades surrounding structures; N2 signifies metastasis in 4-6 regional lymph nodes; and Mi represents microscopic satellite tumors or tumor deposits.

Grade: Not provided. Justification: The surgical pathology report does not include information on the grade of the cancer, which is a measure of how abnormal the cancer cells look under a microscope and an indicator of how quickly the cancer might grow or spread.

Revie wer InitialsDa eeReviewed: ^_ /"," Site: Urinary Bladder, Trigone, Right lateral wall
Justification: The tumor is located in the trigone and right lateral wall of the urinary bladder as described in the macroscopic summary.

Laterality: Right
Justification: The tumor is primarily located on the right side of the urinary bladder, involving the right ureteral orifice and extending up to 0.9 cm into the right ureter.

Histology: Urothelial Carcinoma
Justification: Although not explicitly mentioned in the provided information, urothelial carcinoma is the most common type of bladder cancer. The presence of a tumor invading the lamina propria and muscularis propria supports this diagnosis.

Stage: Not provided (macroscopic summary suggests muscle-invasive disease)
Justification: The macroscopic summary states that the tumor invades the lamina propria and muscularis propria, but the staging information is not explicitly provided in the given text.

Grade: High-grade
Justification: The description of the tumor invading the lamina propria and muscularis propria suggests a high-grade urothelial carcinoma, as low-grade tumors typically do not invade muscle. However, the exact grade is not provided in the given text.

Behavior: Malignant
Justification: The tumor is described as an invasive urothelial carcinoma, indicating malignant behavior."

Note:
Immunostains D2-40 and ERG were used to assess the presence of lymphovascular invasion.
Some of the immunohistochemistry and ISH tests were developed and their performance characteristics were determined by the Department of Pathology. They have notbeen cleared or approved
by the US Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has determined thatsuch clearance or approval is not necessary. These tests are used for clinical purposes. They should not be regarded as
investigational or for research. This laboratory is certified under Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA '88) as qualified toperform high complexity clinical laboratory testing.

6) The specimen is received fresh ,labeled ""Bladder prostate ,seminal vesicles and perivesicular lymph nodes "".It consists of a
bladder with attached prostate and adnexa measuring 17 cm from superior to inferior ,9 cm laterally and 8 cm from anterior to
posterior. The bladder measures 13.5 x 9.5 x 9 cm and is markedly distorted with an underlying non palpable mass. The prostate
measures 4.5 x 4 x 3.8 cm. The right half of the prostate is inked green; the left half of the prostate is inked blue. The anterior
aspect of the bladder is inked black and the posterior blue. The prostatic urethral margin is shaved and submitted. The bladder is
opened along the anterior midline to reveal a tan-yellow fungating predominately necrotic mass fulfilling the majority of the bladder
cavity measuring 12.5 x 9.5 x 6.2 cm. The tumor is more closely associated with the left lateral wall, but extends into all regions of

GROSS DESCRIPTION
A. Received fresh labeled ""right colon""is a 14.5 cm segment of right colonwith an attached 9 cm segment of terminal ileum.An appendix is identi.The serosal surface is smooth and glistening.The wall of the colon
averages 0.3 cm in thickness. The wall of the terminal ileum averages 0.2cm in thickness .The mucosa of the colon demonstrates a brown-yellowsubmucosal nodule measuring 1.3 x 1.3 cm located 5.4 cm from the distal margin.Sectioning reveals a yellow homogenous cut surface. It does not.invade the underlying wall .Multiple soft white polyps are identifiedranging in size from 0.1 to 0.4 cm.All appear superficial. In the
ascending colon, there is an irregular red slightly depressed area
resembling a possible biopsy site measuring 0.8 x 0.2 cm located 14 cm fromthe distal margin. It is superficial and does not invade into the
underlying wall. The remaining mucosa is unremarkable.No firm mass lesions are identified .The mucosa of the terminal ileum is unremarkable. Theattached appendix measures 4.7 cm in length and 0.9 cm in diameter. Thelumen is dilated to 0.2 cm and contains fecal material. No perforations orulcerations are seen .Sectioning through the surrounding fibroadipose
tissue reveals multiple ovoid tan firm nodules resembling lymph nodes.

Behavior: Malignant (urinary bladder cancer), benign (others) - malignancy cannot be ruled out in lymph nodes without additional information.

The histological diagnosis of hyperplastic polyps in the colon, normal tissue in ureters, urethra and vagina, and reactive changes in urethral margin #2 are benign. However, the urinary bladder shows features of malignancy with muscle invasion, which is consistent with a diagnosis of urothelial carcinoma. The lymph nodes show metastatic carcinoma, indicating a malignant process; however, further information is required to determine the primary source and stage of the cancer."

Gross Description:
1). The specimen is received fresh for frozen section consultation, labeled ""Right ureter"" and consists of a segment of ureter
measuring 1 x 0.5 cm. The specimen is bisected and entirely submitted for frozen section.
Summary of sections:
FSC - frozen section control
2). The specimen is received fresh, labeled ""bladder, prostate, and seminal vesicles"". It consists of a bladder with attached
prostate and adnexa measuring 16.5 cm from superior to inferior, 10.5 cm laterally and 4.5 cm from anterior to posterior. The
bladder measures 6.0 x 5.0 x 2.0 cm, the prostate measures 4.4 x 3.5 x 2.5 cm, the right seminal vesicle measures 3.4 x 2.0 x 0.9
cm, the right vas deferens measures 8.0 x 0.5 cm, the left seminal vesicle measures 3.2 x 1.8 x 0.9 cm and the left vas deferens
measures 6.5 x 0.5 cm. The anterior aspect of the bladder is inked blue and the posterior black. The prostatic urethral margin is
shaved and submitted. The bladder is opened along the anterior midline to reveal an ulcerated lesion measuring 3.2 x 2.2 cm
grossly situated within the left lateral wall. The lesion measures 1.5 cm from the left orifice and 3.5 from the right. Both ureters
are probe patent measuring up to 0.2 cm in maximum diameter. The lesion is sectioned to reveal underlying fibrotic papillary
tissue extending to a depth of 1.3 cm grossly approaching into the perivesicular fat. The remaining bladder mucosa is inked tan
and otherwise grossly unremarkable. Discrete perivesical lymph nodes are not grossly identified. The prostate is serially
sectioned to reveal diffuse tan-yellow nodularity. The entire prostate is submitted.' is submitted. Representative sections are

6. Behavior: The behavior of the tumor is malignant, as indicated by the mention of a ""Prima Tumor"" and descriptions of cellular features consistent with cancer.

Justification for choices:

* Site: The primary tumor location is mentioned throughout the report, and the organ involved is identified as the breast.
* Laterality: Not provided in the given information.
* Histology: While a definitive histological diagnosis is not provided, there are descriptions of cellular features that suggest malignancy.
* Stage: The pathologic stage is explicitly stated as T2 N0 M0.
* Grade: Not explicitly stated in the given information.
* Behavior: The behavior of the tumor is implied to be malignant based on the mention of a ""Prima Tumor"" and descriptions of cellular features consistent with cancer."

COMMENT:
Part 2: The permanent section of the left ureteral resection margin shows mild urothelial atypla, which, at most,
represents low grade intraurotheilal neoplasia (dysplasia ). Then! Is no evidence of carcinoma in situ or invasivecarcinoma at the margin.
Part 3: A sectionof the bladder wall with adjacent vaginal will (block 3C) shows tumor infiltrating between smooth
muscle bundles, which are felt to represent the outer bundles of detrusor muscle ,rather than vaginal wall smoothmuscle . Vaginal wall involvement by tumor Is therefore not evident.

Reviewer bluer _ f1 DISQUAUPIED"," 1. ""Site"": Urinary bladder. Justification: The report clearly states ""PRIMARY URINARY BLADDER TUMORS"" under the synoptic data section.
2. ""Laterality"": Not provided. Justification: The report does not mention laterality as it pertains to a urinary bladder tumor, which is typically centered in the midline of the body.
3. ""Histology"": Urothelial (transitional cell) carcinoma with micropapillary features. Justification: The report mentions ""Urothelial carcinoma"" under the histologic type and specifies ""with variant histology: micropapillary"" later on.
4. ""Stage"": pT3b N1 M0. Justification: The report indicates ""pT3b"" under pathologic staging, meaning the tumor has invaded through the bladder wall and into perivesical fat but not into adjacent organs or the pelvic or abdominal wall. Additionally, metastatic urothelial carcinoma is found in one of two lymph nodes on the right side (pN1) and no distant metastasis (M0) is identified.
5. ""Grade"": High-grade. Justification: The report clearly states ""Urothelial carcinoma - High-grade"" under the histologic grade section.
6. ""Behavior"": Malignant. Justification: Given that it's a high-grade, invasive cancer, its behavior is malignant by definition."

B9-B 11: One candidate lymph node, grossly involved by tumor, representative
sections
C. The third container is additionally identified as, ""3. Bladder, prostate,
seminal vesicles, vas deferens"". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 17.5
x 9 x 6 cm cystoprostatectomy specimen consisting of a 0.2 x 6 x 4.5 cm bladder
with attached mesenteric fat and an approximately 5 x 4 x 3 cm prostate. The
right seminal vesicles measure 4.5 x 3 x 1cm and right vas deferens measures 8
x 0.6 cm. The left seminal vesicles measures 4 x 3.1 x 1.3 cm and left vas
deferens measures 2.5 x 0.6 cm. The right ureteral stump measures 3 x 0.6 cm,
the left measures 2.2 x 0.6 cm, and both demonstrate intact, patent lumens.
The right half of the prostate and bladder is inked blue and the left half is
inked black. The outer surface of the bladder is inked black. The bladder and
prostate are opened anteriorly along the urethra. The capsule is absent and the
apex of the prostate is disrupted. Sectioning demonstrates ill-defined broad
areas of firm, yellow-tan indurations throughout the prostate parenchyma focally
extending to ink. The seminal vesicles demonstrate cystic cut surface with
gold-brown thick secretion. The left seminal vesicle is focally grossly involved
by the lesion.
The opened bladder reveals a red-brown lesion with shaggy and ulcerated surface
involving the entire posterior wall extending to the left and right lateral
walls as well as the inferior anterior wall. The lesion measures 3.5 x 1.5 cm.
On cut section, the bladder demonstrates firm yellow-tan cut surface grossly
consistent with tumor involvement/possible fibrosis with maximal thickness of
2.2 cm. The lesion extends through the lamina propria into the perivesicular
fat to within 0.2 cm of the ink. On one section it surrounds the right ureter.
The surrounding bladder mucosa is edematous, wrinkled, tan-brown with wall
thickness of 1.3 cm. Bilateral ureteral orifices, adjacent to the trigone, are
identified and probe patent. Received separately in the same container is a 3 x
3 x 1 cm aggregate of yellow lobular adipose tissue from which one candidate
lymph node measuring 0.2 cm identified.
Representative sections are submitted as follows:
C 1: Distal prostatic urethral margin (apex)

D. The fourth container is additionally identified as, ""4. Distal left ureter"".
Received fresh and placed in formalin is a soft and rubbery, tan-pink, and
oriented ,1.0 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm tissue grossly consistent with mucosa with minimal
attached adipose tissue. A lumen is not identified. The specimen is submitted in
toto as E 1
E. The fifth container is additionally identified as, ""5. Distal right ureter,
stitch on non-margin side"". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a soft and
rubbery, 1.2 x 0.9 x 0.6 cm tissue containing a segment of ureter with wall
thickness of 0.1 cm and a patent lumen of 0.2 cm. B. margins side is trimmed and
submitted as E I.

D.Received fresh labeled ""left pelvic lymph nodes"" are multiple fragments
of yellow fibrofatty tissue aggregating to 6.5 x 6.5 x 1.0 cm. Palpation
reveals ten pink firm nodules ranging in size from 0.3 to 1.5 cm in
greatest dimension. The specimen is entirely submitted as follows: Dl five
nodules; D2 three nodules; D3 one nodule; D4 - D6 remaining fat.
E.Received fresh labeled ""right pelvic lymph nodes #2"" are multiple
fragments of yellow fibrofatty tissue aggregating to 6.5 x 5.5 x 1.0 cm.
Palpation reveals nine tan firm nodules ranging in size from 0.5 to 9.0 cm
in greatest dimension. The largest nodule is predominantly fat replaced.
The specimen is totally submitted as follows: El two nodules; E2 two
nodules; E3 two nodules; E4 two nodules; E5 - E7 largest nodule sectioned
and totally submitted; E8 - E10 remaining fat.
F.Received in formalin is a specimen consisting of a urinary bladder,
bilateral ureters, prostate and attached seminal vesicles and vas
deferentia. The bladder measures 2.0 x 5.5 x 4.5 cm. The external surface
of the bladder is covered by smooth lining-at the dome and fibroadipose
tissue of the remaining portion. After the bladder is opened, a firm white
papillary-like mass is identified measuring 4.5 x 4 .0 x 2.0 cm within the
posterior wall. The mass is papillary and solid. On sectioning, the mass
extends through the muscularis propria into the perivesical adipose tissue
retracting the overlying serosa. The serosal surface appears involved. The
remaining bladder mucosa is unremarkable. The wall of the bladder appears
thickened. A segment of right ureter measures 2.8 cm in length and is
patent. Its mucosal surface is smooth and glistening. A segment of left
ureter is 2.2 cm in length and its mucosa is also unremarkable. The
prostate measures 4.5 cm transversely, 3.0 cm anteroposteriorly and 3.0 cm
craniocaudally. The capsular surface is smooth. The gland is inked with
blue on the right and yellow on the left and sectioned from apex to base
transversely at 3 mm intervals perpendicular to the urethra. The urethra
has been amputated in the same plane as the prostatic urethra, therefore, a
shave margin cannot be obtained. Cross sections of the prostate reveal a
tan solid cut surface without any definitive lesions. Rubbery nodularity is
not present. The seminal vesicles are unremarkable. Segments of vas
deferens are also unremarkable. Representative sections are submitted as
follows: Fl right ureter; F2 left ureter; F3 posterior bladder wall with
mass retracting local surface; F4 posteriori wall mass; F5 posterior wall
mass in relation to perivesical fat; F6 anterior bladder wall; F7 right

Specimen Comments
SPECIMEN
1-Bladder and prostate
CLINICAL DETAILS
Bladder cancer.
MACROSCOPY
Specimen comprises bladder and prostate measuring in total 160 mm supero-
inferiorly, 95 mm transverse, and 60 mm anterior-posterior. Total weight =
460g. The bladder contains an extensively necrotic polypoid tumour on the
posterior wall measuring at least 40 x 70 x 30 mm. The tumour is close to the
detrusor muscle and is 8 mm from the posterior serosal margin. There are
bilateral ureteric stumps measuring 5 x 4 mm each.
MICROSCOPY
There is a poorly differentiated, Grade 3, transitional carcinoma involving the
lateral and posterior wall, close to and surrounding the right ureter. It
invades muscularis propria. It extends to within 9 mm of the prostate, but
there is no convincing evidence of invasion into the perivesical fat. Squamous
differentiation is noted, but elsewhere the tumour has a spindle
cell/sarcomatoid appearance. It does not show the lymphoepithelioma-like
appearance suggested on the previous biopsy.
No vascular invasion has been identified. The circumferential margin is clear
of tumour. Both ureteric resection margins are clear of tumour. The uninvolved
bladder wall is severely inflamed and focally denuded of urothelium. Where
present, it shows some atypia but there is no evidence of carcinoma-in-situ.
Although the urethral resection margin is clear of transitional bladder
carcinoma, there is a focus of prostatic adenocarcinoma at this margin (Block
IA). There are further multiple foci of Gleason score 3 + 3 = 6 prostatic
adenocarcinoma in both right and left prostatic lobes, measuring at least 14 mm
in dimension. High grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, PIN, is also
present. There is no evidence of extracapsular extension.
SUMMARY
1-Transitional cell carcinoma of bladder G3 p1'2, completely excised.
2 - Adenocarcinoma of prostate, Gleason score 3 + 3 = 6, pT2, at urethral
resection margin.

urothelial carcinoma of the bladder .He undergoes radical cystoprostatectomy.
Gross Description
The specimen is received in seven parts, each labeled with the patient's name and medical record
number. Parts A-C are received fresh. Parts D-G are received In formalin.
Part A, labeled ""right ureter ,""consists of a single unoriented pink fragment of soft tissue measuring 1.2
x 1.1 x 0.3 cm. It is entirely submitted for frozen section diagnosis 1, with the frozen section remnant
submitted in cassette Al.
Part B ,labeled ""left ureter ,""consists of a single unoriented pink fragment of soft tissue measuring 1 x 1
x 0.3 cm .It is entirely frozen for frozen section diagnosis 2, with the frozen section remnant submitted
in cassette B1.
Page 2 of 4 Part C is additionally labeled ""bladder /prostate,"" and consists of a single unoriented urinary bladder and
prostate specimen weighing 346 grams and measuring 21.6 x 10 x 5 .2 cm. The urinary bladder
measures 7.5 x 7 x 6.2 cm with the attached anterior /superior fatty tissue measuring 10 x 8.5 x 3.8 cm.
The prostate measures 4.2 cm medial -lateral x 3 cm anterior -posterior x 2.7 cm superior-inferior. The
serosal surface Is mostly smooth and glistening without grossly obvious lesions. The ureteral margins
are flush with the surrounding tissue (i.e., no appreciable length ).The left ureter measures 0.6 cm in
average diameter with a 0.2 cm wall thickness ;the right ureter measures 0.5 cm In average diameter
with a 0 .1 cm to 0 .2 cm wall thickness .The right anterior surface is inked green ;the left anterior
surface Is Inked blue; the posterior surface is inked black .The urethral margin is removed and
submitted for frozen section diagnosis 3, with the frozen section remnant submitted in cassette C1. The
urinary bladder and prostate are opened anteriorly to show a large red-tan ulcerated and necrotic mass
occupying almost the entire right lateral bladder wall, measuring 4.2 x 3 cm. The left ureter is patent to
probing ;however, the right ureter cannot be probed due to blockage by the mass .Upon serial
sectioning ,the mass abuts the green inked margin (right anterior )with a maximum thickness of 1.8
cm. The mass appears to invade the muscularis propria with extension into the perivesical soft tissue.
The mass is 0.7 cm to the black inked margin (posterior )and 2 .7 cm to the blue inked margin (left
anterior). The mass also appears to extend to and involve the base of the prostate. Serial sectioning of
the prostate reveals mostly firm /rubbery porous tissue with punctate orange -brown gritty material
scattered throughout .The base of the prostate appears to be involved by the urinary bladder mass;
however ,no other discrete lesions or masses /nodules are Identified In the prostate .Representative

Page: 6 of 6"," Site: The specimens are taken from various sites including bladder, left and right distal ureters, and pelvic lymph nodes. This is necessary to examine the extent of the disease and ensure complete removal of cancerous tissue.

Laterality: Laterality is specified for the ureter specimens, with some designated as left or right distal ureter #1 or #2. This information is crucial for determining the location and spread of the disease.

Histology: The histology of the specimens is not explicitly provided in the description. However, given the context of cancer surgery and the mention of high-grade dysplasia, it can be assumed that the histology relates to urothelial carcinoma or a similar malignancy.

Stage: The stage of the disease is not explicitly mentioned in the specimen descriptions. However, the extent of tissue sampling suggests an advanced stage, as multiple sites and regions are being examined for cancerous involvement.

Grade: High-grade dysplasia is mentioned for some specimens, indicating a high likelihood of malignancy with aggressive behavior. This information is essential for determining the appropriate treatment approach and prognosis.

Behavior: The behavior of the disease is not explicitly stated but can be inferred as malignant given the mention of high-grade dysplasia and cancer surgery. Thorough examination of the specimens will help confirm the presence and extent of malignancy, informing treatment decisions and prognosis.

Not provided: Some information such as the patient's medical record number, account number, visit date, discharge date, and attending physician is not provided in the description. This information is typically used for tracking and coordinating patient care but is not necessary for the pathological examination of the specimens."

Gross Description:
1). The specimen is received fresh labeled, ""Bladder, prostate, seminal vesicles, peri-vesicle lymph node"". It consists of a bladder
with attached prostate and adnexa measuring 19.0 cm from superior to inferior, 11.0 cm laterally and 5.0 cm from anterior to
posterior. The anterior aspect of the bladder is inked blue and the posterior black. The prostatic urethral margin is shaved and
submitted. The bladder is opened along the anterior midline to reveal hemorrhagic, ulcerated, indurated, necrotic tumor measuring
5.0 x 4.8 x 1.8 cm which is grossly situated within the left and right posterior walls. The tumor grossly involves both the left and
right ureteral orifices. Both ureters are probed patent measuring up to 0.2 cm in maximum diameter. The lesion is sectioned to
reveal white-pink cut surface with invades the underlying fat. Possible extension to the inked fat is grossly identified. The remaining
bladder mucosa is pink-tan with the normal folds. Two ovoid lesions measuring 0.6 x 0.4 cm are identified at the dome and right
posterior wall. Discrete perivesical lymph nodes are grossly not identified. The prostate is serially sectioned to reveal white-tan
prostatic parenchyma with multiple yellow foci and white fluid filled cysts identified. A gold thread-like material is identified within
the prostate. Representative sections are submitted sections from each prostatic quadrant and transition zone. TPS is submitted,

Gross Description:
1) The specimen is received fresh labeled, ""Bladder, prostate, seminal vesicles, urachus and urethra, stitch marks left pelvic
sidewall margin"". It consists of a bladder with attached prostate and seminal vesicles measuring 15 cm from superior to inferior,
14.5 cm laterally and 4 cm from anterior to posterior. A stitch marks the left pelvic sidewall margin which is inked orange. The
anterior aspect of the bladder is inked blue and the posterior black. The prostatic urethral margin is shaved and submitted. The
bladder is opened anteriorly to reveal a tan-pink endophytic granular tumor measuring 6 x 5.7 cm which is grossly situated within
the dome and left posterior wall and grossly involve the underlying adipose tissue. Within the bladder is a 4 x 3.5 x 2.2 cm free
floating blood clot. The lesion lies 1.5 cm from the left ureteral orifice and 2.5 from the right. Both ureters are probe patent,
measuring up to 0.2 cm in maximum diameter. The lesion is sectioned to reveal a maximum depth of invasion is 3.5 cm and
grossly approaches the inked fat and pelvic sidewall. The remaining bladder mucosa is tan-pink and focally edematous. Discrete
perivesical lymph nodes are not grossly identified. The prostate is serially sectioned to reveal tan nodular cut surfaces. The
specimen is representatively submitted including two sections from each prostatic quadrant and transition zone. TPS is submitted.

1.) The specimen is received fresh, labeled ""bladder, urethra, urachus, perivesical tissue, uterus, bilateral tubes and ovaries and
anterior vaginal wall"". It consist of a bladder, urethra, urachus, perivesical tissue, uterus, bilateral tubes and ovaries and anterior
vaginal wall measuring 10.5 cm from superior to inferior, 15.0 cm laterally and 14.0 cm from anterior to posterior. The bladder
measures 9 x 8.5 x 4.2 cm, the uterus measures 5.5 x 3.2 x 1.5 cm, the right ovary measures 2.0 x 1.1 x 0.6 cm, the right fallopian
tube measures 10.5 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm, the left ovary measures 2.2 x 1.2 x 1.0 cm, and the left fallopian tube measures 9.8 x 0.2 x 0.2
cm. The portion of vaginal cuff measures 7.1 x 4.0 x 0.2 cm. The distal urethral margin and the vaginal cuff margin are shaved and
submitted. The ureteric stumps measure 4.0 cm and are unremarkable. The specimen is inked black and the bladder is opened
anteriorly to reveal:
Mass #1 -- In the right lateral wall, is a 1.7 x 0.7 x 0.2 cm soft, ulcerated, ovoid tan-brown mass , located 2.5 cm from the left
ureteric orifice and 0.2 cm from the right ureteric orifices. On sectioning, the tumor extends into but not through the muscularis
propria, to a depth of 0.2 cm, 0.6 cm away from the deep margin.
Mass #2 --In the right posterior dome, is a 1.5 x 1.1 x 0.6 cm, soft, ulcerated, irregular bordered, tan-brown mass, located 0.3 cm
from the left ureteric orifice and 0.7 cm from the right ureteric orifices. On sectioning, the tumor extends into but not through the
muscularis propria, to a depth of 0.6 cm, 1.2 cm away from the deep margin.
Mass #3 -- In the left posterior dome, is a 0.9 x 0.8 x 0.6 cm, rubbery, pedunculated tan-brown mass, located 2.3 cm from the left
ureteric orifice and 4.0 cm from the right ureteric orifices. On sectioning, the tumor appears to abut the muscularis propria and is
2.0 cm away from the deep margin. A portion of this mass has been submitted to TPS.
Mass #4 -- In the left lateral wall, is a 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.1 cm firm, round, tan-brown, papilliferous mass , located 2.5 cm from the left
ureteric orifice and 4.2 cm from the right ureteric orifices. On sectioning, the tumor appears to remain confined to mucosa and is
2.0 cm away from the deep margin.
Mass #5 --In the lower left anteriolateral wall, abutting the trigone, is a 2.1 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm firm, centrally ulcerated, bosselated
bordered sessile , tan-brown mass, located 0.4 cm from the left ureteric orifice and 2.6 cm from the right ureteric orifices. On
sectioning, the tumor extends into but not through the muscularis propria, to a depth of 0.7 cm and is 1.0 cm away from the deep
margin.
In addition, located in the right lateral wall, is a 2.0 x 2.0 x 1.1 cm diverticula.The remaining bladder mucosa is edematous andcongested. A possible discrete perivesical lymph node is identified and entirely submitted. The uterus is bivalved to reveal a
roughly triangular endometrial cavity containing a flat, tan endometrium.The myometrium is smooth, tan-white and has two, E.
rubbery, round tan-white mural nodules with smooth white cut surfaces, both averaging 0.4 cm in greatest dimension. The left
ovary is bisected to reveal a 1.5 x 1.1 x 0.8 cm unilocular, thin-walled, clear fluid filled cysts with a smooth tan-white inner lining.

#1
On immunohistochemical staining, the incidental fallopian tube lesion expresses ER, EMA and WT-1, whereas it is negative for PR,
cairetinin, keratin 5/6, p53, p63, 34BE12 and D2-40. The proliferative rate with Ki-67 stain is low (<5%). Inhibin and GFAP
immunostains were also performed, but the lesion was no longer present in the slides stained. These results support fallopian tube
epithelial differentiation. The fallopian tubes were entirely submitted for histologic examination and additional abnormalities are not
identified.
The lesion is, therefore ,best considered a focus of epithelial hyperplasia.
This part of the specimen was reviewed in consultation with Dr. who concurs. Representative slides were also
reviewed at the daily intradepartmental pathology consensus conference.

E. The fifth container is additionally identified as, ""bladder/prostate"".
Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 316.9 g, 16 x 9 x 4.8 cm
cystoprostatectomy specimen consisting of a 6.5 x 6 x 2.5 cm bladder with attached mesenteric fat and a focal and 5 x 4 x 2.8 cm prostate. The right
seminal vesicles measure 4 x 2 x 1.5 cm and right vas deferens measures 10 cm.
The left seminal vesicles measures 3.5 x 2 x 1 cm and left vas deferens measures
12 cm. The right ureteral stump measures 1.4 x 0.4 cm, the left measures 1.0 x
0.4 cm, and both demonstrate intact, patent lumens. The ureteral margin has
jagged appearance and measures 0.1-0.4 cm in length and 0.5 cm in diameter.
The right half of the prostate and bladder is inked blue and the left half is
inked black. The bladder and prostate are opened anteriorly along the urethra.
The prostate is surrounded by a thin, intact membranous capsule which is
partially disrupted at anterior surface and sectioning demonstrates rubbery,
pink-tan, peri-urethral nodularity with no discrete masses or indurations.
The opened bladder reveals a 3.4 x 2.2 cm shaggy, deep red tan ulceration
located in posterior wall and bladder dome. This ulcerated area is located 5
centimeters from distal urethral margin, 0.4 cm from right ureter orifice and
0.6 cm from left ureter orifice, but does not involve ureters or trigone area
On cut section, the ulcerated area is superficial, measuring up to 0.3 cm in
thickness, and grossly involves underlying densely fibrotic muscularis propria.
It is located 1.8 cm from the deep inked margin. The surrounding bladder mucosa
is edematous, congested, pink-tan with a uniform 0.3 cm wall thickness.
Bilateral ureteral orifices, adjacent to the trigone, are identified and probe
patent.

Justification: The report describes a focus of invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma in the left lobe of the prostate with a greatest nodular diameter of 0.3 cm, which involves less than 3% of the total prostate volume examined and is organ-confined without extracapsular extension. The seminal vesicles are free of carcinoma, and all surgical resection margins are free of tumor. Focal high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia is identified. No evidence of carcinoma was found in two lymph nodes each from the left and right iliac regions, and there is no evidence of carcinoma in the urethral resection margin biopsy.

Information on the patient's age, PSA level, and other clinical factors that are relevant to staging is not provided in the report. Therefore, the stage was determined based only on the pathological findings. Similarly, information on the grade group according to the WHO/ISUP system is not provided, so it was calculated from the Gleason score."

Effective January 1 ,2010 this Checklist utilizes the 7th edition TNM staging
system for prostatectomy of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and
the International Union Against Cancer (UICC).
Comment
Part B: The metastatic carcinoma is represented by a single gland that is
positive for Cam5.2. Immunohistochemical stain PSA is non-contributory due to
the absence of the malignant gland on a section submitted for
immunohistochemistry.
Interpretation performed by the Attending Pathologist and reviewed with the Clinical History:
The patient is a year-old male with bladder cancer undergoing cystectomy.
Specimens Received:
A: Left pelvic lymph nodes
B: Right pelvic lymph nodes
C: Bladder, prostate, seminal vesicles, vas deferens
D: Left distal ureter stitch
Gross Description:
The specimens are received in four containers each labeled with the patient's
name and medical record number.
A. The first container is additionally identified as, ""left pelvic lymph
nodes"". Received fresh and placed in formalin is an aggregate of lobulated
yellow fibroadipose tissue measuring 7.2 x 5. 4 x 1.3 cm .The specimen is
dissected for lymph node candidates .5 lymph node candidates are identified
measuring 0.5-4.5 cm in greatest dimension .The lymph node candidates are
entirely submitted as follows:
A 1: 2 lymph node candidates
A2: One lymph node candidate ,bisected
A3-A4: One lymph node candidate ,sectioned
A5-A8: One lymph node candidate ,sectioned
B. The second container is additionally identified as, ""right pelvic lymph
nodes"". Received fresh and placed in formalin is an aggregate of lobulated
yellow fibroadipose tissue measuring 7.9 x 7.1 x 1.6 cm. The specimen is
dissected for lymph node candidates. 10 lymph node candidates are identified
measuring 0.4-7.5 cm in greatest dimension. The lymph node candidates are
entirely submitted as follows:
B 1: 4 lymph node candidates
B2: 3 lymph node candidates
B3: One lymph node candidate, bisected
B4-B5: One lymph node candidate, sectioned
B6-B8: One lymph node candidate, sectioned
C. The third container is additionally identified as, ""3. Bladder, prostate,
seminal vesicles, vas deferens "". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a
514.6 g, 20.5 x 11 x 5 cm cystoprostatectomy specimen. The bladder is 8.5 x 8.5
x 5 cm. The right ureteral stump is 4.5 x 0.5 cm and the left ureteral stump is
3 x 0.4 cm. The prostate is 6.3 x 4.8 x 4.8 cm. The right seminal vesicle is 4.3
x 2.3 x 0.9 cm and the right vas deferens is 11.8 x 0.4 cm. The left seminal
vesicle is 4.3 x 2.4 x 1 cm and the left vas deferens is 6.5 x 0.5 cm. There are
2 additional detached segments of vas deferens measuring 3.8 x 0.4 cm and 9.8 x 0.3 cm. The right half of the prostate and bladder is inked blue and the left
half is inked black. The bladder and prostate are opened anteriorly along the
urethra. The prostate is surrounded by a thin, intact membranous capsule and
sectioning demonstrates rubbery, pink-tan, peri-urethral nodularity and a 3.5 x
1x 1 cm area of firm, tan-white induration along the posterior aspect
bilaterally. The seminal vesicles contain dilated cystic spaces filled with
tan, gelatinous material. The opened bladder reveals a 3 x 2.7 cm ulceration
located in the right posterior/lateral wall with a 5 x 4.2 cm surrounding area
of hemorrhagic mucosa. The remaining bladder mucosa is edematous, wrinkled and
pink-tan with a uniform 0.2 cm wall thickness. The bladder is serially
sectioned to reveal tumor grossly extending to a depth of 1.4 cm which is 2.4 cm
from the inked blue margin. Bilateral ureteral orifices, adjacent to the
trigone, are identified and probe patent.
Representative sections are submitted as follows:
Cl: Distal prostatic urethral margin (apex)
C2: Right and left ureter resection margin (right side is inked blue)
C3-C5: Prostate apex, shaved and serially sectioned
C6-C9: Representative right lobe of prostate from apex to base
C 10-C 13: Representative left lobe of prostate submitted from apex to base
C 14: Right seminal vesicle and vas deferens
C 15: Left seminal vesicle and vas deferens
C 16: Uninvolved bladder mucosa, posterior wall
C 17: Uninvolved bladder mucosa, left lateral wall
C18: Hemorrhagic mucosa, dome
C 19: Uninvolved bladder mucosa, anterior wall
C20-C30: Bladder mass/Ulceration (entirely submitted) with the deepest area of
invasion in cassette C20 (with inked margin deep to the area of invasion in
cassette C21).
D. The fourth container is additionally identified as, ""left distal ureter
stitch on non-margin side"". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a rubbery
white-tan tubular structure measuring 0.9 cm in length and 0.6 cm in diameter.
There is a stitch designating the non-margin side. The margin side is shaved and
submitted in D 1.

Case i.' ( circle):
Revie Ini"," Site: Bladder and prostate
Laterality: Right and left side involved
Histology: Urothelial carcinoma (based on the description of ulceration, hemorrhagic mucosa, and bladder wall thickening)
Stage: The tumor extends to a depth of 1.4 cm which is 2.4 cm from the inked blue margin, suggesting at least pT2 stage
Grade: Not provided
Behavior: Malignant (based on the invasive nature of the tumor and the presence of ulceration)

Justification: The description of a grossly visible tumor with ulceration, hemorrhagic mucosa, and deep invasion into the bladder wall suggests urothelial carcinoma. The involvement of both right and left sides of the bladder and prostate indicates laterality. The stage is determined based on the depth of invasion, which is at least pT2. The grade is not provided in the description, but it can be determined by microscopic examination of the tumor. The behavior of urothelial carcinoma is typically malignant, with potential for local invasion and metastasis."

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:A-C:See final microscopic-diagnosis.
D:Sections of the bladder show an invasive poorly differentiated transitional
cell carcinoma ,grades 3 &4/4 (D2-7).A focus of in situ carcinoma is seen
adjacent to the invasive tumor (D7).Theinvasive tumor is characterized by cords,
nests and solid sheets of poorly differentiated transitional cells .The tumor
extends through the bladder wall into the surrounding perivesical fat. The tumor
is adjacent to but does not invade the right ureter (D2).Tumor is present 1 mm
from the closest inked radial margin (D4) on the right lateral side.
Lymphovascular space invasion is seen (D5).Random sections of the bladder outside
the diverticulum show no evidence of urothelial dysplasia or neoplasia but do
demonstrate the presence of chronic cystitis. Previous biopsy sites are seen in
sections taken from between the right ureterovesical junction and diverticulum.
Sections of the prostate show unilateral (left )prostatic adenocarcinoma
(D23,29),Gleason' s score 6 (3+3).The tumor is characterized by variably sized
glandular structures that infiltrate the stroma .The tumor is confined to the
prostate with focal involvement of the capsule, without penetration into
periprostatic soft tissue .All margins as well as bilateral seminal vesicles are Page 6 of 6
free of tumor. The prostatic urethra is free of urothelial dysplasia and
malignancy.

Diagnosis Comments:
Bladder Tumor Synoptic Comment
1.Tumortype:Urothelial (transitional cell).
2.Tumorgrade: High grade.
3.Tumorsize:3 cm.
4.Extentof tumor in bladder: Invasion into outer half of rauscularis
propria.
5.Lymphatic/vascular invasion: None identified.
6.Epithelial abnormalities in bladder: Carcinoma in situ.
7.Extension of tumor into organs adjacent to bladder: Ureter, right.
8.Surgical margins:
C5.Urethral margin: Free of tumor.
Right ureter margin: Final margin freeof tumor.
Left ureter margin: Final margin free of tumor.
Perivesical margin: Negative, closest margin is 0.2 cm, posterior, slide
9.Lymph nodes: No tumor (0/24).
10.Other pathologic findings in bladder: Ulceration and chronic
inflammation.
11.AJCC/UICC stage: pT2bNOMX.
12.Additional margin: The distal end of Part A (right ureter) is involved by
high grade invasive carcinoma (slide A3) into the
muscularis propria; however the proximal specimen margin (slide Al)
demonstrates chronic inflammation of the lamina propria with
atypia of the urothelial mucosa with we regard as reactive atypia. In Part D
(labeled final proximal margin of the right
ureter) the proximal specimen margin (slide Dl) is negative for dysplasia or
carcinoma. However the distal end of this specimen (slide 04) reveals nuclear atypia of urothelial carcinoma in situ. Because Of
the intense chronic inflammation, distinguishing
reactive vs dysplastic changes are difficult. Immunohistochemical stain for
p53 was performed on slide D3 where the inflamed
urothelium have atypical, round, slightly enlarged nuclei and prominent
nucleoli. The stains highlights scattered positivity.
Thus based on the morphology and results of the immunohistochemical stain, the
atypical changes on slide D3 are regarded as
reactive. Dr. has reviewed select portions of Parts A and D
and concurs. Level section on C9 confirms the
diagnosis.
Interoperative Diagnosis:
FS1(A)Right ureter, proximal margin, biopsy: Chronic ureteritis with
atypia, favor dysplasia.
FS2(B)Left ureter, biopsy: No tumor seen.

Justification: The report explicitly describes the presence of high-grade urothelial carcinoma in the bladder, right ureter, and urethra. While the left ureter biopsy did not reveal any tumor, the proximal margin of the right ureter shows chronic ureteritis with atypia, which is considered as dysplasia favoring malignant transformation. The high-grade nature of the tumors and their presence in multiple locations suggest malignant behavior."

COMMENTS:
Bladder Tumor Synoptic Comment 1. Tumor type: Urothelial carcinoma. 2.
Tumor grade :High-grade. 3.Tumor size: 4.0 cm maximum diameter. 4.
Extent of tumor in bladder :Invasion through muscularis propria into
peri-vesicle tissue .5.Lymphatic /vascular invasion :Lymphatic and blood
vessel invasion identified. 6.Epithelial abnormalities in bladder: Focal
giant cell reaction and acute /chronic inflammation with reactive atypia. There is mild cytological atypia but insufficient for a diagnosis of low gradedysplasia. 7.Extension of tumor into organs adjacent to bladder: No
adjacent organs involved. 8. Surgical margins: All marginsfreeof tumor;see additional comment below. 9. Lymph nodes: one of fifteen lymph nodescontains metastatic tumor (1/15); the largestmetastatic deposit measures 0.3cm in greatest dimension; there is no extranodal tumor growth. 10. Other
pathologic findings in bladder:None identified. 11.AJCC/UICC stage: pT3aNlMX. 12.Additional comments:The urothelial carcinomaextends towithin 0.3 cm of the inked radial specimen margin, and extends to within 0.5cm of the prostate.
A small focus of prostatic adenocarcinoma(Gleason 3+3) is identified in the
left mid prostate (C13). No perineural invasion is identified, and the tumor
extends to within 0.5 cm of therightlateral specimen margin.High molecularweight keratin stain and p63 immunohistochemical stains are performed and
evaluated on block C13 to further evaluate the prostatic adenocarcinoma. Bothstainshighlight the lack of basal cells confirming the diagnosis.
Level sections are performed and evaluated on blocks C7, C20 and D2 to reach
the above diagnoses.

Page 5 of 5END OF REPORT"," Site: The specimens were obtained from various locations including the bladder, prostate, seminal vesicles, pelvic lymph nodes, distal urethra, and pelvic floor. Justification: The site is an essential category to understand the origin of each specimen.

Laterality: Some specimens were specified as left-sided or right-sided, including the pelvic lymph nodes, ureters, and prostate lobes. Justification: Laterality is crucial for determining the side of any potential pathology.

Histology: The histological type was not explicitly provided in the report. However, the context suggests that the specimens were related to urological procedures. Justification: Histology is essential for understanding the nature of the tissue and any underlying pathological processes.

Stage: The stage of any potential cancer was not provided in the report. Justification: Staging is crucial for determining the extent of spread of a malignancy, which informs treatment options and prognosis.

Grade: The grade of any potential tumor was not provided in the report. Justification: Grading provides information about the differentiation of cancer cells, which can help predict behavior and response to treatment.

Behavior: The biopsy reports do not mention whether the specimens showed benign or malignant behavior. Justification: Determining the behavior of the tissue is crucial for making appropriate clinical decisions."

3) The specimen is received fresh labeled, ""Bladder ,prostate ,seminal vesicles , urethra, urachus, perivesical tissue and nodes, left
rectus muscle "".It consists of a cystoprostatectomy specimen with attached soft tissue at the superior aspect measuring 18.5 cm
from superior to inferior, 14.5 cm laterally and 6 cm from anterior to posterior . A disrupted cyst-like structure , probably representing
an organized hematoma is identified in the soft tissue , partially covered by skeletal muscle on the anterior surface . The inner
surface of the structure is hemorrhagic. The skeletal muscle portion measures 6 x 2.2 x 0.3 cm. The anterior aspect of the bladder
is inked black and the posterior blue; the soft tissue margin is inked green . The prostatic urethral margin is shaved and submitted.
A urachal remnant measuring approximately 6 cm in length and 0 .3 cm in diameter is identified . The bladder is opened along the
anterior midline to reveal seven cauliflower -like fungating masses occupying most of the bladder cavity measuring from 0.5 x 0.5 x
0.5 cm to 5 x 6 x 4 cm, situated on the anterior , right and left lateral and posterior walls and dome . The stalk of the left lateral tumor
is 1.6 cm from the left orifice and the stalk of the right lateral tumor is adjacent to the orifice. Both ureters are probe patent
measuring up to 0.2 cm in maximum diameter .Serial sectioning reveals that the tumors are limited to the stalk and do not show
gross invasion .Serial sectioning through the anterior portion / dome of the bladder reveals a perforation with a sinus tract draining
into the soft tissue attached to the bladder , 0.2 cm from the hematoma . The remaining bladder mucosa adjacent to the tumors
shows ulcerations .Discrete perivesical lymph nodes are not grossly identified and the specimen is submitted for lymph node
dissection .The prostate is serially sectioned to reveal unremarkable prostate parenchyma .The prostate is submitted entirely. TPS
is submitted ,photographs are taken.

Notes:
4"," 1. ""Site"": The site is not explicitly mentioned in the report, but based on the context, it seems to be a pathology report for a gynecological surgery, so I will assume the site is related to the reproductive system, though it's not clearly defined.
2. ""Laterality"": Not provided, as there is no information about laterality in this report.
3. ""Histology"": The histology is not explicitly stated, but based on the mention of ""Prima Tumor"" and the use of terms like ""diseased normal,"" it can be inferred that this is a report for a primary tumor, though the specific type of cancer is not identified.
4. ""Stage"": The stage is not provided in this report.
5. ""Grade"": Not provided, as there is no information about the grade of the tumor in this report.
6. ""Behavior"": Not provided, as behavior typically refers to whether a tumor is benign or malignant, and that information is not explicitly stated in this report."

carcinoma (C7,8-15), grades 3 and 4 of 4, extending into perivesical soft tissue
and associated with multiple foci of lymphovascular invasion. Associated with
invasive tumor are foci of in situ urothelial carcinoma (flat lesion). Additional
multiple random sections of bladder including trigone, right lateral wall, left
lateral wall, dome, posterior wall and left ureterovesical junction show urothelial
carcinoma in situ (C2,3,5,6,8,15,16). All resection margins are free of dysplasia
and malignancy. Sections of the left ovary show a simple serous cyst and corpora
albicantia. The tubular structure grossly identified from the area of the ovary is
consistent with the round ligament.

Reviewer Initial Date Reviewed:
11"," Site: The primary tumor site is the bladder, as evidenced by the pathological report indicating deeply invasive poorly differentiated urothelial carcinoma in sections of the bladder (C7,8-15).

Laterality: The tumor is located in the left lateral wall and trigone of the bladder, as noted in sections C8, C11-12, and C16.

Histology: The histological type of the tumor is urothelial carcinoma, which is confirmed by the pathological report (C7,8-15).

Stage: The stage of the tumor is not explicitly provided in the report; however, the presence of deeply invasive poorly differentiated urothelial carcinoma with lymphovascular invasion suggests a late stage.

Grade: The tumor grade is given as grades 3 and 4 out of 4, indicating high-grade malignancy (C7,8-15).

Behavior: The behavior of the tumor is malignant, with deeply invasive growth into perivesical soft tissue, multiple foci of lymphovascular invasion, and in situ urothelial carcinoma."

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:A-C:See final diagnosis.
D:Sections of the bladder show an invasive transitional cell carcinoma broadly
extending through the muscularis propria and into the perivesical fat (Dl-4). The
corresponding ,subjacent inked radial margin is negative for tumor. No definite
lymphovascular space invasion is identified .The adjacent urothelium along the
left lateral wall shows mild to moderate urothelial dysplasia. No carcinoma in
situ (flat lesion identified).
Sections of the prostate show a unilateral prostatic adenocarcinoma ,comprisedof variably sized glands infiltrating the fibromuecular stroma .The tumor ispredominantly along the left distal prostate (D19-20).No invasion into the
capsule or periprostatic soft tissue is identified .A few areas of atypical glandsare also seen in the right prostatic lobe (D15, D18 ).Two K903 stains performed
show intermittent staining of basal cells around critical glands ,supportingdiagnoses of high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and atypical basal cellhyperplasia .The apical urethral and radial margins as well as bilateral seminal
vesicles and vasa deferentia are all free of tumor.

Laterality: The bladder cancer is not specified as to laterality, while the prostatic adenocarcinoma is predominantly on the left distal prostate. Justification: The report mentions that the bladder cancer is broadly extending through the muscularis propria and into the perivesical fat but does not specify if it is on one side or the other. Meanwhile, the prostatic adenocarcinoma is described as predominantly on the left distal prostate.

Histology: The bladder cancer is a transitional cell carcinoma, while the prostate cancer is an adenocarcinoma. Justification: The report describes the bladder cancer as an invasive transitional cell carcinoma and the prostate cancer as unilateral prostatic adenocarcinoma.

Stage: The staging information for both cancers is not provided in this report. Justification: The report does not include any mention of the staging for either the bladder or the prostate cancer.

Grade: The grade for the bladder cancer is not provided, while the prostatic adenocarcinoma is high-grade. Justification: The report does not include any mention of the grade for the bladder cancer, but it does describe the prostatic adenocarcinoma as unilateral and predominantly on the left distal prostate with a few areas of atypical glands in the right prostatic lobe. Two K903 stains performed show intermittent staining of basal cells around critical glands, supporting diagnoses of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and atypical basal cell hyperplasia.

2.0 cm with attached prostate and urethra. The urethra measures
4.0 x 2.5 x 1.8 cm, showing a red-tan, hemorrhagic, edematous,
mucosal surface. The posterior wall of the bladder is partially
covered with pink-tan, smooth, shiny peritoneum, measuring 6.0 x
5.0 cm. The superoanterior margin of the specimen is attached
with yellow-tan, lobulated fibroadipose tissue, containing lymph
nodes, measuring 9.0 x 5.0 x 3.5 cm. Right and left ureters are
identified. The right ureter measures 3.4 cm in length and
approximately 0.4 cm in diameter. The right ureter is probed,
showing a pink-tan, smooth, shiny inner surface. The left ureter
measures 3.6 cm in length and is dilated to approximately 0.9 cm
in diameter. The left ureter is probe-patent and contains clear
fluid. The surgical margin is entirely inked. The bladder is
opened anteriorly, showing an irregular ulcerative, hemorrhagic,
firm tumor mass which occupies the left bladder wall and one of
the posterior wall includes a right and left orifice, trigone and
proximal urethral areas. The tumor mass measures 4.7 x 4.0 x 2.0
cm, protruding through the left bladder wall and extending to
paravesical fatty tissue.
The prostate is separated from the bladder and will be processed
later. Representative sections are submitted.

COMMENTS:
Bladder Tumor Synoptic Comment 1. Tumor type: Urothelial carcinoma, papillary
with squamoid features. 2.Tumor grade: Grade 3/3 (2003 WHO
classification). 3.Tumor size: 0.4 cm (D8). 4. Extent of tumor in
bladder: 0.4 cm focus of invasive tumor in outer half of the muscularis
propria (D8). 5.Lymphatic/vascular invasion: Not present. 6.Epithelial
abnormalities in bladder: Polypoid cystitis and nonspecific granulomatous
inflammation (post transurethral resection of bladder tumor) see note below.
7.Extension of tumor into organs adjacent to bladder: Prostate. 8.
Surgical margins: Urethral margin: Negative. Right ureter margin: High grade
urothelial dysplasia. Left ureter margin: Negative. Perivesical margin:
Negative. 9.Lymph nodes: Nine of 30 lymph nodes contain metastatic tumor
(9/30); the largest metastatic deposit measures 2.0 cm in greatest dimension
(C2) ; there is focal extranodal tumor growth (Cl).
11.AJCC/UICC stage: pT2bN2MX.
The bladder mucosa, submucosa and muscularis propria of the dome and trigone
show an intense nonspecific granulomatous inflammatory reaction with foreign
body giant cells and focal necrotizing palisading granulomas (C8). These
findings are consistent with the patient's recent history of transurethral
resection of his bladder tumor, at these sites. The bladder mucosa is
otherwise benign with polypoid type chronic inflammation and focal hyperplasia,
with no residual carcinoma or dysplasia. There is a microscopic focus of high
grade urothelial carcinoma located in the outer half of the muscularis propria
of the trigone. A 0.3 cm focus of high grade urothelial carcinoma is present
in the periurethral prostate.

SPECIMEN
Bladder and prostate.
CLINICAL DETAILS
Invasive bladder cancer. Extensive desmoplastic reaction ?tumour.
MACROSCOPY
Cystoprostatectomy weighing 375 g. The prostate measures 25x43x32 mm. The
bladder measures 55x70x65 mm. There is a ulcerated tumour at the posterior
bladder wall. It measures 50 mm x 30 mm with a thickness of 23 mm with invasion
of the bladder wall, but not obviously beyond into perivesical tissue. The
tumour is close to the seminal vesicles and the posterior resection margin.
MICROSCOPY
The bladder contains an ulcerated poorly-differentiated micropapillary
transitional cell carcinoma with lymphovascular and perineural invasion. The
surface shows multinucleated giant cells amidst the granulation tissue. The
tumour is confined to the posterior bladder wall. The tumour infiltrates beyond
the muscularis propria of the posterior bladder wall with microscopic invasion
of vesical fat and is 2 mm away from the deep posterior margin. The tumour has
an accompanying fibrous response and abuts but does not invade the seminal
vesicles or prostate. Two separate deposits of tumour are seen distant from the
main mass, near the anterior wall.
The flat urothelium is not dysplastic.
See also for further information: both of the ureteric resections
show no evidence of malignancy.
The prostate shows hyperplasia and no evidence of prostatic adenocarcinoma nor
invasion by the bladder tumour.
SUMMARY
The features are those of a grade 3 transitional cell carcinoma of
micropapillary type, pT3a Nx Mx.

Reviewer Initials Catr. Re.iev:ed"," 1. ""Site"": Bladder. Justification: The report clearly states that the specimen is a cystoprostatectomy and the tumor is located in the bladder.
2. ""Laterality"": Not provided. Justification: The report does not mention any laterality as the tumor is in the bladder which is a midline structure.
3. ""Histology"": Poorly-differentiated micropapillary transitional cell carcinoma. Justification: The microscopy section of the report mentions this specific type of carcinoma.
4. ""Stage"": pT3a Nx Mx. Justification: The summary section of the report states this stage, indicating the tumor has invaded beyond the muscularis propria but there is no information about lymph node or distant metastasis.
5. ""Grade"": III. Justification: The report mentions the tumor is a grade 3 transitional cell carcinoma.

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:
A-C: See final microscopic diagnosis.
D: Sections of the bladder representing the section of the polypoid mass in the left lateral wall shows a moderate
to poorly differentiated papillary urothelial carcinoma (D4-9), grade 3 of 4, extending into the superficial part of the
muscularis propria. Associated with invasive tumor are foci of in situ urothelial carcinoma (flat lesion) which
mainly involve the left lateral and posterior wall of the bladder. The left bladder wall also shows chronic
inflammation, fibrosis and changes consistent with previous biopsy site. The rest of the bladder mucosa shows
extensive chronic inflammation with cystitis glandularis and cystitis cystica. All resection margins of the bladder
are free of dysplasia and malignancy. The prostatic urethra show polypoid cystitis (D23). Sections of the prostate
show marked chronic inflammation; otherwise, the prostate is free of dysplasia or malignancy.

COMMENT:
Permanent sections of the colonic wall from the site of previous sigmoid polypectomy reveal an area of
adenomatous mucosa within the granulation tissue and focally on the surface. I cannot exclude the possibility that
the adenomatous mucosa in the granulation tissue is a focus of residual carcinoma. The change is not seen on
review of the frozen sections and only focally on the permanent sections of this specimen. That includes deeper
sections of the paraffin block.The surface adenomatous change is close to an inked margin but on deepers is not
seen to involve it.i

Justification: The report includes a diagnosis of ""Invasive poorly differentiated papillary urothelial carcinoma"" in the bladder.

Laterality: Not provided
Justification: The report does not specify which side of the bladder is affected by the cancer.

Histology: Urothelial carcinoma
Justification: The report specifies that the tumor is a urothelial carcinoma, which is a type of cancer that starts in the cells that line the inside of the bladder.

Stage: pT2bN0MX
Justification: The report includes a pathologic TNM stage of pT2bN0MX for the bladder cancer. This indicates that the tumor has invaded the muscle of the bladder wall (pT2) and has not spread to nearby lymph nodes (N0) or distant sites (M0).

Grade: Grade 3/4
Justification: The report specifies that the urothelial carcinoma is poorly differentiated, which is a characteristic of high-grade tumors.

Behavior: Malignant
Justification: The report includes a diagnosis of cancer, which is by definition a malignant condition."

0Page 8 of 8END OF REPORT"," Site: The specimens were taken from various locations including left and right vas deferens, ureters, lymph nodes (common iliac, pelvic, pre sacral, external iliac), cloquet node, and perivesicle nodes. Justification: The site is where the tissue was taken from which helps in identifying the origin of the specimen.

Laterality: Many of the specimens were specified as left or right sided. Justification: Laterality is important in determining if there are any differences between the two sides, and it can also help in identifying the location of the lesion or abnormality.

Histology: The histology of the specimens includes benign lymph nodes, ureters, vas deferens, and prostate. Justification: Histology is the study of the microscopic structure of tissues, and it can help in diagnosing diseases or abnormalities present in the specimen.

Stage: The stage was not provided in the report. Justification: Staging is a way to describe where a cancer is located, if or where it has spread, and whether it is affecting other parts of the body. It helps doctors plan treatment and estimate a patient's prognosis.

Grade: The grade was not provided in the report. Justification: Grading is a system used to classify cancer cells based on how abnormal they appear under a microscope, and how quickly they are likely to grow and spread. This can help doctors plan treatment and estimate a patient's prognosis.

Behavior: The behavior of the specimens was described as benign. Justification: Behavior refers to whether the specimen is normal or shows signs of disease or abnormality. In this case, the specimens were all benign, meaning they were not cancerous and did not show any signs of abnormal growth or behavior."

B. RIGHT URETER
Received fresh for frozen section is a tan pink tubular segment of ureter 0.5cm in length and 0.4cm indiameter. Toto FSB
C. BLADDER, TUBES, OVARIES AND VAGINAL WALL
Received fresh in a matching container and subsequently fixed in formalin is a cystectomy and bilateral
salpingo-oophorectomy specimen measuring overall 14.5 x 10.5 x 6.1 cm, including the urinary bladder
(7 x 6 x 1.5 cm) and peri-cystic fatty tissue . The posterior fatty margin is inked black and the anterior
surface blue. A portion of tan smooth vaginal wall is demonstrated measuring 4 x 3cm. The urinary
bladder is opened from the anterior aspect to reveal a fungating mass present on the right posterior
lateral wall of the bladder with surface hemorrhage and ulceration, measuring 4.6 x 3.0 x 1.1 cm. The
tumor is 2.5 cm from the closest urethral margin. The tumor appears to invade into the muscularis
propria but not in the perivesicular fat. The tumor involves right ureter orifice but grossly does not
appear to involve the right ureter. The remainder of the bladder mucosa is pink-tan and focally
edematous. No other lesions are identified. The attached right fallopian tube is 5 cm long x 0.3 cm in
diameter, with a paratubal cyst 1.5 x 0.9 x 0.9 cm. The right ovary is 2 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm, The left fallopian
tube is 4.2 cm long x 0.4 cm in diameter with fimbriated end. The left ovary is 2 x 1 x 1 cm. The
posterior aspect of the uterus is covered with pink-tan smooth vaginal mucosa (6.4 x 3.2 cm). Careful
palpation and dissection of perivesicle tissue reveals three possible lymph nodes. Representative
sections are submitted as follows:

Tumor size: 4 cm
Primary tumor (pT) : Tumor invades into the vaginal wall, pT4a.
Margins of resection: The distal urethral margin shows high-grade
papillary urothelial carcinoma with no invasion. The ureteral margins
are negative. The outer soft tissue margins of the specimen are
negative.
Vascular invasion: Present
Regional lymph nodes (pN): pNO
Distant metastasis (pM): pMX
Other findings: Other areas of urothelial atypia with severe atypia and
focal papillary urothelial carcinoma are present.
The tumor shows extensive necrosis. Immunohistochemical stains with
the neural markers synaptophysin, chromogranin and CD 56 are performed.
The synaptophysin and chromogranin are negative. CD 56 is focally
positive suggestive of focal neuroendocrine differentiation within the
tumor.

Page 6 of 6 END OF REPORT"," Site: The specimens are from various locations, including the common iliac lymph nodes (right and left), pelvic lymph nodes (right and left), presacral lymph node, vas deferens (right and left), bladder, prostate, and seminal vesicles. The justification for this category is to provide anatomical context for the pathological findings.

Laterality: The specimens are from both sides of the body, including right, left, and bilateral cases. This information is crucial in determining potential differences in pathology based on laterality.

Histology: The histology of the specimens varies, but common findings include lymph nodes, soft tissue, and urothelial tissue. The histological diagnosis is essential for identifying specific diseases or abnormalities at the cellular level.

Stage: The stage is not provided in the report, as it typically requires additional information such as tumor size, lymph node involvement, and metastasis. Staging is important for determining the extent of disease progression and developing appropriate treatment plans.

Grade: The grade is not provided in the report, as it typically requires additional information about the degree of differentiation or abnormality of cells. Grading is essential for predicting the behavior of tumors and guiding treatment decisions.

Behavior: The behavior is not provided in the report, but it is generally classified as benign, malignant, or uncertain/indeterminate. This information is critical for determining the potential for further growth, spread, or recurrence of a disease."

Gross Description:
The specimens are received in eight containers each labeled with the patient's
name and medical record number.
A. The first container is additionally identified as, ""uterus ,cervix,
bilateral tubes and ovaries ,urethra, bladder "".Received fresh and placed in
formalin is a 236. 0 gm, 13 .5 x 11 x 5 cm pelvic exenteration specimen composed
of a bladder ,uterus with complete adnexa ,cervix and vaginal mucosa. The bladder is 8.5 x 6 x 3 cm, tan-pink with a smooth glistening serosal surface. On
both the posterior wall and left lateral aspect of the bladder dome serosa there
is a 2.5 x 1 cm area of slightly firm contracted bladder wall. The left ureter
is 2.5 x 0.4 cm and the right ureter is 4.5 x 0.5 cm and each is probe patent.
Attached at the inferior aspect is a segment of urethra that is 4.3 cm in length
by 1.5 cm in diameter. The contracted serosal surface and the lateral resection
margins are inked black. The bladder is opened along the lateral walls to reveal
an ulcerated granular tan-pink to red lesion (4.5 cm in length by 1.2-2.5 cm in
width) extending from the posterior wall into the dome on the left lateral half
of the bladder. The lesion appears to invade into the submucosa and into the
posterior wall on the left lateral aspect of the bladder. There is a second
ulcerated contracted tan-pink granular lesion on the mucosa of the right
superior-anterior wall measuring 1.2 cm in length by 1 cm in width. Between the
two ureteral orifices, superior to the trigone on the posterior wall is a 0.7 x
0.4 x 0.4 cm focus of transparent raised nodular tissue. The bladder is serially
sectioned to reveal a scaly indurated tan-white cut surface with multifocal
red-brown hemorrhage with attached soft yellow glistening adipose tissue. The
lesion appears diffusely distributed across the cut surface of the anterior
wall, posterior wall and bladder dome. The first lesion appears to invade to a
maximum depth of 1.4 cm and is close to the black inked serosa near the bladder
dome. The second contracted lesion appears to invade to a depth of 1.1 cm. The
bladder wall ranges in thickness from 0.9-2.1 cm. The remaining uninvolved
bladder mucosa is tan-pink wrinkled and hyperemic. The perivesicular adipose
tissue is dissected for lymph nodes and no lymph nodes are identified.
Also received as part of the specimen is a uterus with attached adnexa measuring
4 cm from fundus to cervix by 4 cm from cornu to cornu by 2.7 cm from anterior
to posterior. The anterior serosal surface is tan-pink smooth glistening and
grossly unremarkable. The posterior serosal surface is tan-pink dull and matted
but otherwise unremarkable. The right ovary is tan-white cribriform measuring 3
x 1.1 x 1 cm and the right fimbriated fallopian tube is 8.5 x 0.5 cm tan-pink,
slightly indurated and adhesed to the ovary. The left ovary is tan-white,
cribriform measuring 2.5 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm with 2 firm white nodules measuring 0.4
cm in greatest dimension and a left fimbriated fallopian tube that is 7 x 0.4 cm
tan-pink rubbery and adhesed to the ovary. The cervix is 3.5 cm in length. The
cervical face is ill-defined, tan-pink and roughened measuring approximately 2.5
x 2 cm. The cervical os is stenotic. The uterus is opened along the right
lateral wall to reveal a 2 x 0.7 cm, glistening, tan endocervical canal tan-pink
and glistening leading into a triangular endometrial cavity measuring 3 x 2.7
cm. The endometrium is tan-pink glistening with an average thickness of 0.1-0.2
cm The myometrium has a well-circumscribed tan palpably firm area measuring 0.7
x 0.7 x 0.3 cm on the superior anterior uterine wall. The remaining myometrium
is tan, trabeculated and grossly unremarkable. Attached inferior to the uterus
is a segment of pink smooth glistening vaginal mucosa measuring 9.3 x 6.5 cm.
Gross photographs are taken. Representative sections are submitted as follows: A l : Urethral margin
A2: Right ureter margin
A3: Left ureter margin

Comment
The bladder tumor has a very unusual morphology in that it shows dense solid
growth of predominantly epithelioid cells with focal spindling and few loose
myxoid areas. The epithelioid tumor cells are high grade, have modest
amphophilic cytoplasm and with brisk mitotic activity. In addition, numerous
osteoclast-like giant cells are distributed all throughout the tumor. Foci of
tumor necrosis are also present.
Immunohistochemical stains performed show that the tumor cells are nuclear
positive for GATA3 and with rare nuclear positivity for p63. Keratin Cam5.2, CK7
and CK20 are negative. The positivity for GATA3 and p63 are supportive for
urothelial carcinoma. Controls appropriate.
Rare occurrence of osteoclast-like giant cells rich carcinoma, similar to the
current case, has been reported in the urinary tract. The few cases previously
reported showed an aggressive biologic behavior, see reference.
On part C, the right lymphadenectomy specimen shows large soft tissue deposits of carcinoma, which may represent overgrowths from a lymph nodal tumor
metastasis. No normal lymph node tissue however is identified. Of note, right
pelvic lymphadenectomy was performed previously (together with ureterectomy,
which was negative for tumor. Nodal status for the current bladder tumor
ismost consistent with N 1.

Clinical History:
Patient is an year-old male with high-grade urothelial carcinoma undergoing
radical cystectomy, prostatectomy, and lymph node dissection.
Specimens Received:
A: Left pelvic lymph node
B: Bladder ,prostate ,left and right vas differens
C: Right pelvic lymph node
Gross Description:
The specimens are received in three containers each labeled with the patient's
name and medical record number.
A. The first container is additionally identified as, ""Left pelvic lymph node"".
Received in formalin is an aggregate of yellow-tan ,soft, and lobulated tissue
fragments ranging in size from 1.1-1.4 cm in greatest dimension. The specimen is
dissected to reveal 10 lymph node candidates ranging in size from 0 .3-1.3 cm in
greatest dimension .The specimen is submitted as follows:
A 1: 3 lymph node candidates
A2: 2 lymph node candidates
A3: 2 lymph node candidates
A4: 2 lymph node candidates
A5: 1 lymph node candidate
A6: 1 lymph node candidate
B. The second container is additionally identified as, ""bladder, prostate, left
and right vas deferens"". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 250 g, 12.5
x 7 x 6 cm cystoprostatectomy specimen consisting of a 8.5 x 6.5 x 3 cm bladder
with attached mesenteric fat and a detached 3.2 x 2 x 1.7 cm probable tumor (or prostate). The right seminal vesicles and right vas deferens are not clearly
identified and a structure resembling the right seminal vesicles measure 1.5 x
1.5 x 0.4 cm and there is no identifiable right vas deferens structure. The
left vas deferens is not clearly identified and the left seminal vesicles
measures 2.5x 1.5 x 0.4 cm and a structure resembling the left vas deferens
measures 3 x 0.4 cm. The right ureteral stump measures 0.6 x 0.4 cm end
demonstrates an intact, patent lumen. The left ureteral stump is absent and the
left ureteral resection margin is taken where the ureter enters the bladder and
is submitted as B3.
The right half of prostate and bladder is inked blue and the left half is inked
black. The bladder and prostate are opened anteriorly along the urethra. The
fragments of the outer surface of the tumor fragment are white-brown and shaggy.
Sectioning demonstrates a diffuse, homogenous, ill-defined, firm, white-tan.
The opened bladder reveals a 1.8 x 1.2 x 0.3 cm raised, soft, red-pink lesion on
the anterior wall designated as lesion #1, a 4 x 1.8 x 0.3 cm raised, soft,
red-pink lesion on the inferior posterior wall and right inferior lateral wall
designated as lesion #2, a 2.5 x 2.5 cm left posterior wall hemorrhage, and a
1.4 x 1 x 0.2 cm raised, soft, red-pink lesion on the mid left lateral wall
designated as lesion #3. There is also an aggregate of firm, white-tan tumor
fragments, free floating within the bladder lumen and measuring 11 x 5 x 3 cm.
On cut section, lesion #1 extends into the muscularis propria and grossly into
the perivesical tissue and is close to the deep margin. On cut section, lesion
#2 does not extend beyond the mucosa, and lesion #3 does not extend beyond the
mucosa and is 1.0 cm from the deep margin.
There is a 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm rubbery, white-tan, mass which is in the muscle
layer of the left lateral anterior wall and extending into the perivesicular
adipose tissue.
The surrounding bladder mucosa is edematous, wrinkled, congested, pink-tan with
a uniform 0.1-0.2 cm wall thickness. Bilateral ureteral orifices, adjacent to
the trigone, are identified and probe patent.
Representative sections are submitted as follows:
B 1: Right ureter resection margin
B2: Distal prostatic urethral margin
B3: Left ureter resection margin (insertion into the bladder
B4-B 10: Representative right and left of probable tumor (rule out prostate)
B 11- B 13 Lesion # 1 (closest to deep margin B 13)
B 14-B 16 Lesion #3 (closest to deep margin B 16)
B 17-B 19: Lesion #2
B20: Uninvolved bladder mucosa bladder dome
B2 1: Uninvolved bladder mucosa anterior wall
B22: Uninvolved bladder mucosa posterior wall B23: Uninvolved bladder mucosa trigone
B24: Uninvolved bladder mucosa right lateral wall
B25: Uninvolved bladder mucosa left lateral wall
B26: Possible tumor deposit 0.3 cm from deep margin
B27: Representative vas deferens and seminal vesicles
.B28-B30: Representative free floating tumor fragments
B31-32: Additional free floating tumor fragments
B33-B38: Additional possible prostate
B39-B44: Additional free floating tumor fragments
C. The third container is additionally identified as, ""Right pelvic lymph
node"". Received in formalin is an aggregate of yellow-tan, soft, and lobulated
fiber adipose tissue fragments ranging in size from 1-1.5 cm. The specimen is
dissected to reveal for lymph node candidates ranging from 0.5-1.5 cm in
greatest dimension. The lymph node candidates are submitted as follows:
C 1-C3 : 1 lymph node candidate ,bisected (each cassette)
C4: 1 lymph node candidate

Gross Description:
The specimens are received in nine containers each labeled with the patient's
name and medical record number.
A. The first container is additionally identified as, ""peritoneal nodule"".
Received fresh for intraoperative diagnosis is a 2 .74g, 2.3 x 1.7 x 1.3 cm
fragment of white rubbery tissue that is bisected to reveal a multicystic cut
surface consistent with ovary .One half of the specimen is frozen and read as
""ovarian tissue ,with benign cyst"". The frozen section remnant is submitted in
cassette At FS. The remainder of the specimen is entirely submitted in cassette
A2.
B. The second container is additionally identified as, ""right ovary"". Received
fresh and placed in formalin is a 4.8 x 1.2 x 0.5 cm tan-brown heavily
cauterized rubbery tissue fragment. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal
fatty fibrous tissue with no gross ovary identified. Specimen is entirely
submitted in cassettes B 1-B4.
C. The third container is additionally identified as, ""left ovary"". Received
fresh and placed in formalin is a 7.56 g, 3.5 x 3 x 1.2 cm firm white-tan nodule
with adjacent fibrofatty tissue. The specimen is bivalved to reveal a uniform
yellow-tan nodule within a 0.1 cm thick white-tan cyst wall. No gross ovarian
tissue is identified. The specimen is entirely submitted in cassette C 1-C4.
D. The fourth container is additionally identified as, ""bladder and urethra"".
Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 249.06g, 15 x 13 x 4.2 cm cystectomy
specimen with attached mesenteric fat and tubing in bladder. The bladder
measures 7 x 6.5 x 3 cm. The urethral stump measures 3 cm in length by 1.1 cm
diameter and is probe patent. The right ureteral stump measures 4 cm in length
by 0.6 cm in diameter which is discontinuous and disrupted by cautery midway
through the length of the ureter. The right ureter probes patent but the orifice
is involved by shaggy indurated mucosa. The left ureteral stump is discontinuous
to suture and cautery at one segment measuring 1 cm in length by 0.6 cm in
diameter. The left ureteral orifice can't be identified at the trigone.
Additionally the bladder is remarkable for a 6 x 4.5 cm portion of mucosa
attached to the posterior aspect of the urethra to the lower posterior aspect of
the bladder. The urethral margin is inked black.
The right half of the bladder is inked blue and the left half is inked black.
The bladder is opened along the right lateral aspect through the dome. The bladder demonstrates an indurated, ulcerated lesion in the lower
anterior-left wall, left lateral wall and posterior wall at trigone. There is an
ill-defined 4.5 x 4 cm indurated area which contains a 3.5 x 3 cm ulceration
surrounded by a hemorrhagic rim of mucosa. Serial sectioning reveals that the
tumor grossly infiltrates into the urethra located 2.8 cm from the urethral
margin and 0.8 cm from the mucosal surface. On cut section the tumor is
white-tan firm, ill-defined extending a maximum depth of 1.8 cm (tumor max
dimensions 4.5 x 4 x 1.8 cm) invading into adipose tissue which abuts the inked
surface (black). The remainder of the mucosa is tan-brown, edematous, and
glistening with a uniform 0.8-1.3 cm wall thickness. Representative sections are
submitted as follows:
D 1: Urethral margin
D2: Left ureteral margin
D3: Right ureteral margin
D4: Tumor relationship to urethra
D5: Anterior wall tumor
D6: Uninvolved anterior wall
D7: Dome
D8: Trigone with tumor (closest approach to inked margin)
D9-D 10: Posterior wall with tumor, hemorrhage and extension to ink

D 12: Left wall with tumor
D 13: Uninvolved left wall
D 14-D 15: Additional representative sections of tumor
D 16: Additional section of urethra
E. The fifth container is additionally identified as, ""left pelvic lymph
nodes"" .Received fresh for intraoperative consultation is a firm tan-pink lymph
node measuring 3.2 x 2. 3 x 0.8 cm. One half of the specimen was frozen and read
as ""positive for carcinoma "" by Dr. [] The frozen section remnant is
submitted in cassette El FS. The remainder of the specimen is submitted in
cassette E2.
F. The sixth container is additionally identified as, ""left pelvic lymph
nodes"". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 15.92 g, 6.2 x 4 x 1.2 cm
aggregate of fibrofatty tissue. The specimen is difficult to dissect secondary
to extremely matted lymph nodes. Dissection reveals 5 candidate lymph nodes

Comment
The lymph node metastasis contains both urothelial and small cell carcinoma
components. The urothelial carcinoma component in the lymph node focally
exhibits micropapillary feature, which is not exhibited by the urothelial
carcinoma in the bladder.
Immunohistochemical stains performed show that the small cell carcinoma
component is diffusely and strongly positive for synaptophysin, confirming the
diagnosis. Controls appropriate.

A7-A8: One lymph node candidate ,bisected ,one half in each cassette
A9-A 11: One lymph node candidate, sectioned
B. The second container is additionally identified as, ""left pelvic lymph
nodes"". Received fresh and placed in formalin is an aggregate of lobulated
yellow fibroadipose tissue measuring 7.5 x 4.0 x 1.3 cm. The specimen is
dissected for lymph node candidates. Multiple lymph node candidates are
identified measuring 0.2-2.5 cm in greatest dimension. The lymph node candidates
are entirely submitted as follows:
B 1: 4 lymph node candidates
B2: 3 lymph node candidates
B3-B5: One lymph node candidate, bisected, each cassette
B6-B7: One lymph node candidate, bisected, one half in each cassette
B8-B9: One lymph node candidate, sectioned
C. The third container is additionally identified as, ""bladder, prostate and
seminal vesicle"". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 285.4 g, 16.5 x 14
x 3.6 cm cystoprostatectomy specimen consisting of a 7 x 6.5 x 3 cm bladder with
attached mesenteric fat and a 4.4 x 4 x 3.3 cm prostate. The right seminal
vesicles measure 2.9 x 1.4 x 0.5 cm and right vas deferens measures 9 x 0.6 cm.
The left seminal vesicles measures 2.5 x 1.2 x 0.7 cm and left vas deferens measures 8 x 0.6 cm. The right ureteral stump measures 2.4 x 0.9 cm and is not

This a poorly differentiated (Grade 3) transitional cell carcinoma with
extensive squamous differentiation and focal glandular differentiation with
signet ring forms.
There is extensive squamous metaplasia of the surface mucosa .Tumour is
identified arising from dysplastic epithelium .The macroscopic appearance of
tumour infiltration into the uterus (pT4) is confirmed with tumour spread to the
outer half of the myometrium of the anterior wall. Vascular invasion is
present .No perineural invasion is identified. The tumour is present at the
serosal surface at the dome .The urethral and the vaginal resection margins are
morphologically normal and clear of tumour. The vaginal mucosa is uninvolved,
but tumour extends to within 5 mm .A diverticulum is identified in the right
lateral wall .Two lymph nodes identified in the perivesical fat do not show
any evidence of metastatic deposit. The ovaries appear unremarkable.
2 - This shows fibrofatty tissue infiltrated by a poorly differentiated
carcinoma with features similar to those seen in part 1.

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:AFS-CFS: See final microscopic -diagnosis.
D:Sections of the bladder taken from the right.lateral wall show a poorly
differentiated invasive urothelial carcinoma (D1,6-9) extending through the entire
bladder wall into perivesical fat (D6,8,9). The tumor involves the right
ureterovesical junction (Dl) where it extends into the intramural portion of the
right ureter and extends through the wall into periureteral and perivesical fat.
The invasive tumor has an adjacent focus of urothelial carcinoma in situ (flat
lesion) (D9). While no lymphatic space invasion is seen, there is a focus of
vascular invasion noted (D8). The peripheral inked perivesical margin is free of
malignancy. Additional random sections of the bladder including the trigone and
bladder neck show foci of squamous metaplasia but no urothelial dysplasia or
urothelial carcinoma in situ. All final resection margins are free of both
urothelial dysplasia and invasive carcinoma.

Dual/Synchronous Primary Noted
Case is (circle):
Reviewer InitialsYet"," Site: Bladder
Justification: The pathology report describes a poorly differentiated invasive urothelial carcinoma involving the bladder wall, right ureterovesical junction, and extending into perivesical fat.

Laterality: Right
Justification: The tumor primarily involves the right lateral wall of the bladder, right ureterovesical junction, and right proximal ureter.

Histology: Urothelial carcinoma
Justification: The pathology report describes a poorly differentiated invasive urothelial carcinoma in the bladder and distal ureters.

Stage: At least pT3a (using AJCC 8th edition)
Justification: The tumor invades through the bladder wall into perivesical fat, which is classified as pT3a. Since there is also extension into the intramural portion of the ureter and periureteral fat, it may be higher than pT3a, but further information is needed to assign a more precise stage.

Grade: High grade (poorly differentiated)
Justification: The tumor is described as poorly differentiated in the pathology report.

Behavior: Malignant
Justification: This is an invasive malignant neoplasm, as evidenced by its growth into surrounding tissues and structures."

Gross Description:
Specimen #1 is received fresh for intraoperative consultation labeled left distal ureter and consists of a 0.4 x 0.2 cm tubular tissue
which is submitted in toto for frozen section diagnosis labeled FS1A. The frozen residue is submitted in the corresponding
cassette.
Specimen #2 is received in formalin labeled left pelvic lymph nodes and consists of a 5.0 x 3.5 x 2.0 cm aggregate of fat which is
palpated to reveal multiple nodes ranging from 0.1 cm to 3.0 cm in greatest dimension. The nodes are entirely submitted as
follows:
2A: three possible nodes
2B: two possible nodes
2C-2F: each cassette containing one bisected node
2G-21: one trisected node
2J-2M: one serially sectioned node
2N: 1bisected node
Specimen #3 is received fresh for intraoperative consultation labeled right distal ureter and consists of a 0.6 x 0.4 cm tubular tissue
which is submitted in toto for frozen section diagnosis labeled FS3A. The frozen residue is submitted in the corresponding
cassette.
Specimen #4 is received in formalin labeled right pelvic lymph nodes and consists of a 5.0 x 3.0 x 2.0 cm aggregate of fat which is
palpated to reveal multiple possible nodes ranging from 0.3 cm to 3.5 cm in greatest dimension. The nodes are entirely submitted
as follows:
4A: four possible lobes
4B-4C: each cassette containing two nodes
4D-4G: each cassette containing one bisected node
4H-41: one bisected node
4J-4K: one serially sectioned node
4L-4N: one serially sectioned node
Specimen #5 is received fresh labeled bladder and prostate and consists of a 12.5 x 11.0 x 5.0 cm bladder with attached 5.0 x 4.5
x 4.5 cm prostate. Extending from the prostatic urethra is a 35.0 x 0.7 cm catheter. Partially surfacing the posterior aspect is a 14.0
x 10.0 cm area of smooth peritoneum. Attached to the prostate are right and left vas deferens averaging 5.0 x 0.5 cm. The left
seminal vesicle measures 4.5 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm and the right seminal vesicle 4.5 x 2.0 x 0.5 cm. The right half of the specimen is
inked blue, the left half is inked black and the specimen is opened with a Y-shaped incision along the anterior aspect to reveal an
8.0 x 6.0 x 1.5 cm focally soft and necrotic papillary lesion involving the dome, posterior, anterior and left lateral wall of the bladder.
Noted on the prostate, at the bladder base, are several papillary growths grossly not contiguous with the main mass measuring 1.0
cm in greatest dimension. Further sectioning reveals the mass effacing an area of muscle in the left lateral wall, focally possibly
invading into the adipose tissue, 0.3 cm from the posterior ink. The tumor does not grossly appear to involve the ureter. Serial
sectioning of the prostate reveals a 1.5 x 0.6 cm ill defined tan lesion in the right apex towards the posterior aspect, grossly
abutting the inked capsule. Palpated are five possible nodes ranging from 0.1 cm to 1.5 cm in greatest dimension. Note that
approximately 90% of the prostate is submitted. Representative sections are submitted as follows:

-no high grade atypia or tumor identified
MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:A-G:See final microscopic -diagnosis.
H:Sections of the bladder show multifocal urothelial carcinoma in situ (flat
lesion)[H1-4,6-101 and both non-invasive and invasive poorly differentiated
papillary urothelial carcinomas (H2-7,10 ),grade 4/4. Invasive carcinoma extends
through the entire bladder wall into perivesical soft tissue where it is associated
with multiple foci of lymphovascular invasion (H5).Two incidental right
perivesical lymph nodes are identified both of which are free of malignancy (0/2).
Soft tissue resection margins are free of malignancy .Final resection margins of
both right and left ureters are free of both urothelial dysplasia and malignancy
(EFS, FPS ,J,K).Urothelial carcinoma in situ involves the initial apical
urethral margin (GFS), and along with non-invasive papillary carcinoma ,is also
noted to involve the urethra (I)where it focally extends to the meatus.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIP TION:
A-C:See microscopic-diagnoses.
D:Sections of the exophytic mass lesion and adjacent ulcerated lesion seen
grossly on the mid to left dome region correspond histologically to invasive
transitional cell carcinoma (D2, D3, D4). The neoplastic cells have high NC ratio
with large pleomorphic hyperplastic nuclei and are arranged in solid sheets and
single cells. Extensive desmoplastic change is seen .The tumor extends through
the muscularis propria into the perivesical soft tissue to involve the peritoneum.
Multiple satellite tumor nodules are identified in the perivesical soft tissue. No
carcinoma in situ is identified .Extensive lymphovascular spaceinvasion i s seen.
Sections of the prostate show focal prostatic intraepithelial neoplasm (PIN II and
III) characterized by hyperplastic glands lined by stratified layers of enlarged
cells with corresponding large nuclei and variable prominent nucleoli.

Site: The tumor is located in the breast. This is mentioned in the histological diagnosis as ""infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the breast.""

Laterality: The specific side of the body where the breast tumor is located is not provided in the report.

Histology: The tumor is an invasive ductal carcinoma, which means it started in a milk duct and has spread into the surrounding breast tissue. This is indicated in the histological diagnosis as ""infiltrating ductal carcinoma.""

Stage: The stage of the cancer is not explicitly stated in the report, but some information about the tumor size and lymph node involvement is provided. Based on this information, it appears that the tumor is at least stage II (T2 N1 M0), as it measures greater than 2 cm in diameter and has spread to at least one axillary lymph node.

Grade: The grade of the cancer is not explicitly stated in the report, but some information about the tumor's appearance is provided. Based on this information, it appears that the tumor is high-grade (grade 3), as it is described as having a ""high nuclear grade"" and being composed of ""poorly differentiated cells.""

Behavior: The behavior of the cancer is not explicitly stated in the report, but the fact that it is an invasive ductal carcinoma indicates that it is malignant and capable of spreading to other parts of the body. This is further supported by the finding of lymph node metastasis.

Justification: These categories were chosen because they are commonly used in cancer staging and provide important information about the tumor's location, size, spread, aggressiveness, and potential for metastasis."

Page 2"," Based on the pathology report, here are the relevant categories for the AJCC/UICC staging system:

Site: Bladder

Laterality: Not provided in the report as it is a radical cystectomy specimen and both sides of the bladder are removed.

Histology: Malignant neoplasm, specific type not specified in this report.

Stage: Based on the gross description of the tumor invading the muscularis propria to a depth of 1.3 cm, it appears to be at least pT2. However, the final stage cannot be determined without additional information such as lymph node involvement and surgical margins.

Grade: Also not provided in this report.

Behavior: Malignant, as indicated by the diagnosis of malignant neoplasm.

Justification for choices:

Site is specified as bladder in the clinical history section.

Laterality is not mentioned in the gross description or clinical history sections.

Histology is assumed to be a urothelial carcinoma based on the patient's diagnosis of malignant neoplasm of the bladder, but it is not explicitly stated in this report.

Stage is determined by the depth of tumor invasion into the bladder wall, which is described as invading the muscularis propria to a depth of 1.3 cm. This suggests a stage of at least pT2. However, additional information such as lymph node involvement and surgical margins are needed for a final stage determination.

Grade is not mentioned in this report.

Behavior is assumed to be malignant based on the diagnosis of malignant neoplasm of the bladder."

in diameter and 0.5 cm in length. Entirely submitted for frozen diagnosis and
resubmitted for permanent processing in cassette BFS.
C: The specimen is received fresh from the O.R. and labeled ""Lt. para aortic LN-
f/s"".It consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring 3.5 x 1 .5 x 0.8 cm
which contains five lymph nodes measuring up to 0.5 cm in greatest dimension.
Entirely submitted for frozen section diagnosis and resubmitted for permanent
processing in cassette CFS.
D: The specimen is received fresh from the O.R. and labeled ""Apical urethral
margin-f/a"". it consists of a piece of soft pink-gray tissue measuring 1.4 x 0.3 x
0.2 cm. Entirely submitted for frozen section diagnosis and resubmitted for
permanent processing in cassette DFS.
E: The specimen is received fresh from the O.R. and labeled ""Bladder, uterus, bil. Page 4 of 7
ovaries and tubes and cervix"". It consists of an anterior pelvic exenteration
specimen .Overall, the specimen measures 37 x 16 x 4. 5 cm and on the posterior
surface has an attached smooth, glistening, mobile, pink-yellow peritoneum
measuring 37 x 16 by less than 0.1 cm. The peritoneum doesnot appear to be
involved by tumor. Thespecimen consists of a bladder (5 x 5 x 2.5 cm), attached
globoid uterus (7 x 5 x 1.8 cm), attached bilateral fallopian tubes (right 10 cm in
length and 0.4 cm in diameter, left 11 cm in length and 0.4 cm in diameter), and
attached bilateral ovaries (right 2.2 x 1.3 x 0.8 cm, left 3.4 x 1 x 0.8 cm). The
uterus and bladder are attached but freely mobile with regard to one another. The
specimen surgical resection margins are entirely inked black. The bladder is
opened along the anterior wall, revealing a pliable uninvolved wall thickness of 1
cm.The right and left ureterovesical junctions are identified and are probe
patent. Both ureters are opened .The right attached ureter measures 5.5 cm in
length and 0.6 cm in circumference with normal, appearing mucosa. The left attached
ureter measures 4.5 cm in length and 0.7 cm circumference. Involving the left
ureterovesical junction, left'lateral wall, and left portions of the posterior wall
and trigone is an ulcerated, exophytic, firm, gray-yellow, ill-defined tumor which
measures 3.5 x 3 x 1.8 cm. Upon sectioning through the tumor, it extends through
the bladder wall and into the perivesical fat but does not involve the inked black
resection margin or-the peritoneum. The tumor extends toa depth of 1.8 cm and is
0.2 cm from the inked margin and the peritoneum. Cut surfaces of the tumor are
solid, firm, homogeneous, and white. The remainder of the bladder and ureteral
mucosae are gray and wrinkled. No lymph nodes are grossly palpated in the.
perivesical fat. The specimen is returned to the OR at the surgeon's request for
grossconsultation, at which time he is informed that tumor extends grossly through
the bladder wall with clear resection margins. The bladder and ureteral mucosae are
then fixed in B5 fixative for one hour and the specimen is subsequently entirely
fixed in formalin for a prolonged period prior to taking sections for permanent
processing. The serosa of the uterus is tan-pink, smooth and dull. The fallopian
tubes and ovaries are grossly unremarkable. Upon sectioning through the ovaries,
the cut sections are white to yellow, solid, firm, and grossly unremarkable. The
ectocervix is covered by a shiny, pink-white mucosa. The ectocervix measures 3 x 2
cm and has a flattened os measuring 1.3 x 0.1 cm. Surrounding the ectocervix is a
rim of wrinkled, gray-pink vaginal mucosa measuring 0.3 cm wide that appears
grossly unremarkable. The uterus is bivalved revealing an endocervical canal
measuring 2.5 cm in length that is lined by a smooth tan mucosa. The endometrial
cavity measures 2.5 x 1.6 x 0.5 cm and is lined by a thin, soft, tan, uniform
endometrium 0.1 cm thick. The myometrium averages 1 cm in thickness and shows no
masses or gross abnormalities. Representative sections are submitted in 20
cassettes.

MICRO SCOPIC EXAMINATION:AFS-BFS: See final microscopic-diagnosis.
C:Sections of the bladder show a deeply invasive poorly differentiated papillary
urothelial carcinoma (C10-15) that extends through the entire wall into perivesical
fat (C10,12,13,15). A single focus of'vascular invasion is seen (C12). Resection
margins are free of malignancy. There is no associated in situ carcinoma (flat

case is (circle};ALI
Reviewer Initials"," Site: The primary tumor site is the urinary bladder, based on the microscopic examination of sections from the bladder (C10-15). Justification: Invasive poorly differentiated papillary urothelial carcinoma was identified in the bladder sections.

Laterality: The tumor is located in the left side of the urinary bladder, based on the presence of more extensive tumor involvement and deeper invasion in the left lateral wall (C6) compared to other walls. Justification: Although the tumor involves multiple sites, the most significant findings are seen in the left lateral wall.

Histology: The histological type of the primary tumor is urothelial carcinoma, based on microscopic examination (C10-15). Justification: Invasive poorly differentiated papillary urothelial carcinoma was identified in the bladder sections.

Stage: The tumor stage is muscle-invasive, based on the presence of tumor invasion through the entire wall into perivesical fat (C10, 12, 13, 15). Justification: Invasive urothelial carcinoma extending beyond the muscularis propria indicates a muscle-invasive stage.

Grade: The tumor grade is poorly differentiated, based on microscopic examination (C10-15). Justification: The tumor shows poor differentiation and lacks glandular or squamous differentiation.

Behavior: The behavior of the tumor is malignant, based on its invasive nature and histological features. Justification: Invasive urothelial carcinoma has a high potential for metastasis and recurrence, making it a malignant tumor.

Diagnosis
1. Carcinoma infiltrates in four of seven lymph nodes, right (4/7).
2. Four tumor-free lymph nodes, left (3/4).
3. Soft tissue with extensive infiltrates of a poorly differentiated urothelial carcinoma.
4. Poorly differentiated urothelial carcinoma of the bladder with infiltration of all parietal
layers, ncTu ng the perivesical fatty tissue extending as far as the surgical preparation
margin, the right seminal vesicle and the right ureter. Multifocal invasion of the lymph and
blood vessels. Dysplasia of preserved urothelial sections.
Prostate shows infiltrates of a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the prostate on both
sides that is confined to the organ, above all in the right peripheral area (Gleason 4+5=9).
Gleason 4: 40%; Gleason 5: 30%. The few parts showing Gleason 3 pattern are by definition
not included in the final Gleason score. Maximum tumor size 0.9 cm.
Tumor classification of urothelial carcinoma:
pT4b, LI, V1, R1, pN2 (4/11).
Comment
In the previous frozen sections, parts showing carcinoma in situ were still found in the area of
the right ureter resection margin. The follow-up resection material was free of tumor and
dysplasia. But infiltration of the pelvic wall and involvement of the cystectomy preparationmargin gave R1 status.

-no high-grade atypia or tumor identified
CFS:Bladder neck margin:
-no high-grade atypia or tumor identified
MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:
A-C:See final microscopic-diagnosis.
D:Sections of the bladder show a poorly differentiated invasive urothelial
carcinoma (D1-3,9-11,13,14), grade 4/4, with focal clear features. The carcinoma
is associated with extensive ulceration and penetrates through the bladder wall
into perivesical soft tissue (D1,2,10,11). A focus of lymphovascular space
invasion is seen(D13). Carcinoma comes within 0.5 cm of the anterior radial margin
and 1.2 cm of the bladder neck margin. All other radial margins and bilateral
ureters margins are more widely free of malignancy. No trigone or ureterovesical
junction involvement by dysplasia or malignancy is seen .Metastatic urothelial
carcinoma is identified in one of three left perivesical lymph nodes examined
(D21-23).
Sections of the uterus show a small focus of well differentiated endometrial
adenocarcinoma, FIGO grade 1/3, arising in association with endometrium and a polyp
containing complex endometrial hyperplasia with atypia (D15-17). No myometrial or
cervical invasion is identified. All surgical margins are free of malignancy.

MICROSCOPY
Part A:
Sections from the macroscopically identified lesion in the left infero-lateral
wall confirm a poorly-differentiated invasive urothelial carcinoma, extending to
the outer half of the muscularis propria. The tumour does not extend in to the
perivesical fat.
Sections from the trigone and from the posterior wall contain further separate
foci of invasive urothelial carcinoma with the lesion in the posterior wall
(A10) showing micropapillary change.
Random sections taken from the rest of the bladder show extensive carcinoma in
situ.
There is no carcinoma in situ or urothelial carcinoma affecting the prostatic
urethra or the prostatic ducts.
Sections from the prostate show a small (up to 5mm) focus of organ-confined
microacinar adenocarcinoma of the prostate with a Gleason pattern 3, involving
the left lobe. No extraprostatic or perineural invasion is noted.
The urethral surgical resection margin is morphologically normal.
Part B (right lymph nodes):
7 lymph nodes identified: no metastatic carcinoma
Part C (left obturator nodes):
2 lymph nodes: no metastatic carcinomayUUID:BB68912E•1368 -478F-BC76. 0C1C8532E63FTCGA-ZF-AA5P- 03A-PRRedacted

carcinoma, with a largely solid growth pattern. Foci of necrosis and squamous
differentiation are noted. No carcinoma in situ is seen in the adjacent or
background urothelium.
The macroscopic impression of tumour extending beyond the muscularis propria is
confirmed microscopically (pT3b). There is tumour invasion into medium sized
muscular arteries. The closest margin is the left lateral serosal margin which
lies 2mm away. No lymphovascular or perineural invasion is identified. The
tumour does not invade into the vagina.
The urethral margin is morphologically normal with no evidence of dysplasia or
in situ changes. All the surgical margins are clear of tumour.
