SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 
1. Right insular tumor: astrocytoma with mitotic activity. see 
comment. 
2. Right insular tumor: astrocytoma with mitotic activity. see 
comment. 
Comment:  TCGA-CS-4942 
The tumor in specimens #1 and #2 contains fibrillary astrocytoma 
composed of moderately pleomorphic fibrillary astrocytes. Rare but 
multiple mitoses are present in both specimens #1 and #2. Two mitotic 
f; ·1res are identified in specimen #1 (slide 18) and two mitotic 
tol:1ures are identified in specimen #2 (slide 28). The proliferation 
index as determined by Ki67 (MI8-1) staining is greater than 5% in 
small foci of specimen #2 (slide 2A). The identification of rare 
mitoses and a focally elevated proliferation index suggest that this 
astrocytic tumor is an astrocytoma (WHO grade II) in the process of 
transformation to a higher grade tumor or that these tumor biopsies are 
from a higher grade tumor. Clinical correlation recommended.

TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT promoter have been shown to
benefit
from therapy with alkylating agents .Assessment of MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite
treatment of
DNA followed by real-time PCR amplification of methylated and unmethylated DNA
sequences. The
analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by serial dilution of methylated positive control DNA into
unmethylated DNA, and was assessed to be 1 % of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated
DNA. Factors
such as the presence of >50% non-neoplastic cells in the sample, or extensive tissue necrosis, may
preclude the
detection of methylated MGMT promoter sequences.
FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a stand alone diagnostic
test. This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the
as required
by CLIA ' 88 regulations .Ithas not been cleared or approved for specific uses by the U. S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA). The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
IMMUNOHI STOCHEMISTRY: The GFAP demonstrates a glial fibrillary background.
About 25% of the neoplastic cells over express the p53 protein. With the
MIB-1, there is a proliferation index of about 14% in the more active areas.
These immuno features support the diagnosis of high histological grade
astrocytoma.

Microscopy:
Histological sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin showed fragments of
neocortex with diffuse infiltration by low-grade glial neoplasm ,mainly located in the
white matter, which consists of distinct phenotype cells, which present interspersed
among themselves.
The predominant cell pattern is represented by rounded cell nuclei with delicate and
granular chromatin ,with inconspicuous nucleoli .The cytoplasm is scarce, with
imprecise limits. It can be observed in some areas ,the presence of perinuclear halos.
These cells infiltrate the adjacent cortex ,committing up to layer I ,with frequent neuronal
sattelitosis.
The other cell component ,with lesser quantity of cells is represented by irregular and
sometimes elongated nuclei ,with dense chromatin and eosinophilic cytoplasm with
imprecise limits.
The tumor shows areas with increased cellularity ,inwhich the neuropil displays
rarefaction and eventual microcysts .Mitotic figures are rare .Itwas not observed
vessels with microvascular proliferation and / or necrotic foci.
PER-OPERATIVE
Smears show ,insent fragments ,diffuse low-grade glial neoplasm ,consisting of
elongated nuclei cells with mild dyskaryosis in a rich fibrillar plot .It is note also some
round nuclei cells .There are some eosinophilic and amorphous structures ,suggesting
Rosenthal fibers ,but not conclusive.
Conclusion :Low-grade glioma ,in this material.
Diagnosis:
Resection product of brain lesion in the left temporal region:
-Oligoastrocitoma ,grade IIWHO (ICD-O 9382/3).
NOTE:
-The oligodendroglial component is predominant in this material.
Award of 1 p/1 9q deletion analysis: The hybridizations were performed on 5 micrometers thick sections of formalin-fixed
and paraffin-embedded neoplastic tissue (FFPE) in the most representative tumor area
with Ip36/1g25 and 19g13/19p13 probe. 100 to 200 were evaluated in each
slide cores.
In this case: The ratio of signals from 1p/1q probes was 0 ,58. The ratio of signals from
19q/19p probes was 0,62. Conclusion: Diffuse oligoastrocitoma grade IIWHO with co-
deletion of 1p/19q.

Not Given 
Operation/Specimen: A: Brain/left temporal tumor, biopsy 
B: Brain/left temporal tumor, biopsy 
PATHOLOGICAl, IlIAGNOSIS: 
A and B. Brain, left temporal parietal f exci~_lional biopsies and 
resection: 
Anaplastic astrocytOifia. MIB--l proliferation index: 15%. 
See commp.nt. 
COMMENT 
Specimen A is small fragments of a glial neoplastic proliferation with 
nuclear 
anaplasia and mitotic figures sprinkled throughout the tumor. 
Specimen B is 
large fragments of brain infiltrated and effaced by a similar glial 
proliferation with an astrocyte phenotype, marked nuclear anaplasia, 
and brisk 
mitotic activity. 
The MIB-l proliferation index is about 15%. There is focal (cortical) 
microvascular calcification, but microvascular cellular proliferation 
and 
necrosis are inconspicuous. 
The morphological findings are interpreted as an anaplastic glioma,  predominantly astrocytoma, with perhaps a minor oligodendroglial 
component 
(part A).

Operation/Specimen: A: Brain, excision biopsy 
B: Brain, excision biopsy 
'.THOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS: 
_'ain, right cerebral tumor, excision: Gliosarcoma with ependymal 
differentiation (comment). 
COMMENT He has a 
uid level and 
The Ki-67 labeling index is up to approximately 75% within the nodules. p53 
staining is negative. 
The MGMT promoter methylation assay is negative (see below). There is evidence 
of Ip deletion (see below). 
Three cases of gliosarcoma thought to arise in an ependymoma (2 after 
treatment) have been published. Since osteoid and cartilage can occur in 
posterior fossa ependymomas, it is possible that this tumor may show some 
biological overlap with anaplastic ependymoma.

Interpretation 
Findings are suggestive of allelic loss on chromosome arm lp. 
There is no evidence of allelic loss on chromosome arm 19q . 
• formative loci are: D1S552, D1S468, D1S1612, D19S412, PLA2G4C, D19S606, 
D19S1182 
Results-Comments 
Testing performed on tumor paraffin block  (31) and peripheral blood 
for germline comparison. 
TEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA 
(baseline)/ Tumor DNA pairs using 3 markers at both 1p and 19q. The 3 markers 
on 1p are D1S548, 0181592, and D1S552 (with D1S468, D181612, and D1S496 as 
backup markers) and the 3 markers on 19q are D19S219, D19S412, and PLA2G4C 
(with D19S606 and D19S1182 as backup). All markers are rnicrosatellites (2 or 4 
nt repeats) except PLA2G4C which is a minisatellite (26 nt repeat) 
polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score, 
amplicon size, .and ease of interpretation. The backup markers are used if .the 
first line markers at that chromosome arm are uninformative or otherwise 
ambiguous in their interpretation. LOR at all informative loci on each 
chromosomal arm represents the typical finding in oligodendrogliomas with Ip 
and 19q deletion. 
FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a 
stand-alone diagnostic test. This its performance

'~e context of established procedures and/or diagnostic criteria. 
TECHNICAL SENSITIVITY: The presence of >15% non-neoplastic cells in the sample 
may preclude the detection of allelic loss.

 PRINCIPLE: Among the major subtypes of gliomas, oligodendrogliomas are 
istinguished by their remarkable sensitivity to chemotherapy, with 
approximately 70% of anaplastic (malignant) oligodendrogliomas responding 
dramatically t azine, lornustine, and vincristine 
(termed PCV) ( Unfortunately, no clinical or 
pathologic feature allows accurate prediction of chemotherapeutic response. 
Oligodendrogliomas are also associated with a longer average patient survival 
as compared to astrocytic tumors. However, the histologic distinction between 
oligodendroglioma and astrocytoma is often highly subjective, and there has 
been significant interobserver variation. 
shown have 
allelic loss (loss of heterozygosity) of chromosome arm Ip is a 
statistically significant and currently the best predictor of chemosensitivity 
combined loss involving chromosome arms Ip and 19q predicts both 
chemotherapeutic response and longer survival in patients with oligodendrogliomas 
combined allelic loss of chromosomes Ip and 19q can be considered a 
molecular signature of oligodendroglioma (present in approximately 70-80% of 
oligodendroglial tumors and in only 10% of astrocytomas)

2. Negative for co -deletion of chromosomal arms 1 p and 19q
3. Positive for mutant IDHI -RI 32H protein by immunostain g 124 /13
See comment.
Comment
The portions of cerebrum are diffusely infiltrated and focally effaced by a glial neoplastic proliferation. In
part A, the
non-enhancing tumor is diffusely infiltrative, and sparsely to moderately cellular. In part B, the tumor tends
to be more
solid, with hypercellular areas .The infiltrating cells have oval to elongated and spindle-shaped nuclei. The
immunostain for the mutant IDH1-R132H protein is diffusely positive. There are foci with brisk mitotic
activity and the
Ki-671 MIB-1 proliferation index is up to approximately 13% in the most active areas . Foci of
microvascular
proliferation are also identified, highlighted by the CD34 immunostain and in negative relief by the GFAP
immunostain. There is no tumor necrosis seen in these sections.
Overall, this high histological grade diffuse glioma is most consistent with glioblastoma, WHO grade 4.

Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block (B1).
H and E slide was examined and tumor DNA was enriched by microdissection
TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT promoter have been shown to
benefit from therapy with alkylating agents .Assessment of MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfate
treatment of
DNA followed by real-time PCR amplification of methylated and unmethylated DNA
sequences. The
analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by serial dilution of methylated positive control DNA into
unmethylated DNA, and was assessed to be 1% of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated
DNA. Factors
such as the presence of >50 % non- neoplastic cells in the sample, or extensive tissue necrosis, may
preclude the
detection of methylated MGMT promoter sequences.

Interpretation 
NEGATIVE -No evidence of EGFRvIII mutation is detected 
Results-Comments 
TEST DESCRIPTION: Testing performed on RNA extracted from tissue block 
H slide was examined and no microdissection was 
needed. 
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an attractive molecular 
target 
in glioblastoma because it is amplified/ overexpressed/ and/or mutated 
in·up 
to ""40%"" to 50% of patients. Epidermal growth factor receptor variant 
III 
(EGFRvIII) is an oncogenic, constitutively active mutant form of EGFR 
that is 
commonly expressed in glioblastoma. Cell culture and in vivo models of 
glioblastoma have demonstrated EGFRvIII as defining prognostically 
distinct 
sub~roups of ·""glioblastomas. Additionally I the presence of EGFRvIII has 
been 
shown to sensitize tumors to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors when the 
tumor 
suppressor protein PTEN is intact. RNA is extracted from formalin 
fixed, 
paraffin embedded tissue samples and reverse transcribed to cDNA. The 
cDNA is 
then amplified using standard PCR technique for DNA templates. PCR 
products 
are detected by gel electrophoresis. The limit of detection of this 
assay has 
been determined to be approximately 5 mutant cells in 100 normal 
cells.

Assessment of 
MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite treatment of DNA

Loss of Heterozygosity 1p, 19q Assay (LOH) 
Date Ordered:  Date Reported: 
 Interpretation 
POSITIVE: Allelic loss on chromosome arm 19q is detected. 
No deletion of chromosome arm lp seen. 
Informative loci are: D1S548, D1S1592, D1S552, D19S219, and PLA2G4C 
Results-Comments 
Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block. 
DNA extracted from a corresponding blood specimen was used as normal 
reference 
control. 
H slide was examined and no microdissection was 
needed. 
TEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA 
(baseline)/ Tumor DNA pairs using 3 markers at both 1p and 19q. The 3 
markers 
on 1p are D1S548, D1S1592, and D1S552 (with D1S468, D1S1612, and 
D1S496 as 
backup markers) and the 3 markers on 19q are D19S219, D19S412, and 
PLA2G4C 
(with D19S606 and D19S1182 as backup) . All markers are microsatellites 
(2 or 4 
nt repeats) except PLA2G4C which is a minisatellite (26 nt repeat) 
polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score, 
amplicon size, and ease of interpretation. The backup markers are used 
if the 
first line markers at that chromosome arm are uninformative or 
otherwise 
ambiguous in their interpretation. LOH at all informative loci on each 
chromosomal arm represents the typical finding in oligodendrogliomas 
\iith 1p 
and 19q deletion.

Results-Comments 
TEST DESCRIPTION: Testing performed on RNA extracted manually 
rnicrodissected 
paraffin block 
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an attractive molecular 
target 
in glioblastoma because it is amplified, overexpressed, and/or mutated 
in up 
to 40% to 50% of patients. Epidermal growth factor receptor variant 
III 
(EGFRvIII) is an oncogenic, constitutively active mutant form of EGFR 
that is 
commonly expressed in glioblastoma. Cell culture and in vivo models of 
glioblastoma have demonstrated EGFRvIII as defining prognostically 
distinct 
subgroups of glioblastomas. Additionally, the presence of EGFRvIII has 
been 
shown to sensitize tumors to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors when the 
tumor 
suppressor protein PTEN is intact. RNA is extracted from formalin 
fixed, 
paraffin embedded tissue samples and reverse transcribed to cDNA. The 
cDNA is 
then amplified using standard peR technique for DNA templates. peR 
products 
are detected by gel electrophoresis. The limit of detection of this 
assay has 
been determined to be approximately 5 mutant cells in 100 normal 
cells.

Results-Comments 
Testing performed on DNA extracted from manually micro dissected 
paraffin 
block 
TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT 
promoter 
have been shown to benefit from therapy with alkylating agents. 
Assessment of 
MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite treatment of DNA 
foll011ed 
by real-time PCR amplification (MethyLight) of methylated and 
unmethylated DNA 
sequences. The analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by 
serial 
dilution of methylated positive control DNA into unmethylated DNA, and 
was 
assessed to be 1% of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated 
DNA. 
Factors such as the presence of >50% non-neoplastic cells in the 
sample, or 
extensive tissue necrosis, may preclude the detection of methylated 
MGMT 
promoter sequences.

icroscopic  
 
Permanent section of frozen section demonstrates mildly hypercellular white matter.  The hypercellularity appears due to cells with mildly atypical angular nuclei with out apparent processes.  No mitotic figures are seen.  There is no 
microvascular proliferation or necrosis  
  Addendum  
 Sections demonstrate a modestly cellular glial neoplasm, a dense glial fibrillary stroma.  The tumor cells tend to be modestly clustered and sometimes oriented around vessels but well formed pseudorosettes are not seen.  There is no myxoid or microcystic change and no calcifications are present.  Nuclei are consistently round with modest atypia.  No mitotic figures are seen.  
 The neoplastic cells are diffusely immunoreactive for GFAP as is the fibrillary 
background.  There is no punctate cytoplasmic standing for EMA, strong evidence against ependymal or subependymal lineage.  Neurofilament stain demonstrates a gradation from normally filamentous at the periphery to only rare neurofilament posit ive axons centrally.  Nevertheless, this pattern does suggest 
an infiltrative process.  MIB -1 demonstrates only a very rare positive cell with an 
estimated labeling index of less than 0.1%.  Overall, this immunophenotype confirms the histologic impression of a very low grade but diffusely infiltrating 
astrocytic neoplasm  
 Diagnosis

"," 1. ""Site"": Brain - The report consistently refers to the examination of brain tissue, with no specification of laterality.
2. ""Laterality"": Not provided - The report does not specify the laterality of the tumor.
3. ""Histology"": Well differentiated astrocytoma (Grade II) - The diagnosis clearly states that the tumor is a well differentiated astrocytoma, which corresponds to Grade II based on the WHO grading system for gliomas.
4. ""Stage"": Not provided - The TNM stage is not applicable in this case since it is more relevant for cancers with distinct invasion paths and lymphatic spread, unlike diffuse brain tumors.
5. ""Grade"": II (Well-differentiated or low grade) - As mentioned in the histology section, the tumor corresponds to Grade II based on the WHO grading system for gliomas.
6. ""Behavior"": Infiltrative - The report mentions a neurofilament stain pattern suggesting an infiltrative process and GFAP staining confirming astrocytic lineage, indicating that this is a diffusely infiltrating tumor."

 Microscopic  
 Sections demonstrate a glial neoplasm that diffusely infiltrates both gray and white matter.  In the gray matter, there is prominent perineuronal satellitosis as well as subpial surface spread. Tumor cells have round nuclei with few apparent cytoplasmic processes.  Many demonstrate perinuclear halos.  There is little cytologic atypia.  No mitotic figures are seen.  There is no microvascular proliferation or necrosis.  
.  Addendum discussion : 
 Numerous MIB -1 reactive cells are present throughout the specimen.  A labeling index of 21% is 
calculated.  This is indicative of a markedly proliferative glial neoplasm.  Despite this, no mitotic figures are identified on the  stain and only a rare mitotic figure was indentified on the immunohistochemistry.  Consequently, the tumor must be classified as low grade/grade II. Nevertheless, the very high MIB -1 labeling index suggests more aggressive behavior.  Close 
clinical follow -up is indicated . 
 Final Addendum Diagnosis:  
 Oligodendroglioma, low grade, WHO grade II  
"," 1. ""Site"": The site is the brain, as the report specifically states that the sample is a glial neoplasm, which is a type of brain tumor.
2. ""Laterality"": Not provided, the report does not mention if the tumor is located in the left or right side of the brain.

necrosis with pseudopalisading. There are zones of hemorrhage, with prominent 
thrombosis of vessels. 
The phenotype of this high histological grade glioma (WHO grade IV) is 
predominantly astrocytic. These small cell glioblastomas are difficult to tell apart from malignant oligodendrogliomas. Determining the LOH status of 
this patient may better characterize the neoplasm.

See Microscopy Description and Comment.
Comment
The sections contain portions of cerebrum that are focally slight to moderately infiltrated by a glial
neoplastic
proliferation that has an oligodendroglial phenotype. There is one proliferation center where there is
mitotic activity
and a MIB-1 proliferation index of 6%; the proliferation index elsewhere is up to about 2%. There is not
endothelial
cell proliferation, microvascular cellular proliferation or tumor necrosis.
The neoplasm overall is a low histological grade oligodendroglioma (WHO 2). There is a proliferation
center in which
there is a moderately heightened mitotic and cycling activity. As an isolated finding the meaning of these
proliferation
centers is uncertain. They are not enough for upgrading the neoplasm; but may portend enhanced
biological activity,
and may perhaps be precursors of transformation.
The morphological features of this tumor may be correlated with clinical, imaging, and operative findings
for their
interpretation and patient's follow up.

Loss of Heterozygosity 1 p, 19q Assay (LOH) Date Ordered : Date Reported:
Interpretation
POSITIVE: Allelic loss on chromosome arm 1 p and chromosome arm 19q is detected.
Informative loci are :D1 S548 ,D1 S1592 ,D1 S552 ,D19S1182
Results -Comments
Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block DNA extracted from a
corresponding
blood specimen was used as a normal reference control.
Only one of 5 loci on chromosome 19q is informative .Based on LOH at DI 9S1182 , LOH of 1 p and
morphology of
oligodendroglioma ,findings are consistent with deletion of 19q as well. Clinical and morphologic
correlation is
recommended.
TEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA (baseline )/ Tumor DNA
pairs using 3
markers at both 1 p and 19q. The 3 markers on 1 p are D1 S548, D1 S1592 ,and D1 S552 (with D1 S468,
D1 S1612, and
D1S496 as backup markers )and the 3 markers on 19q are D19S219 ,D19S412 , and PLA2G4C (with
D19S606 and
D19SI 182 as backup). All markers are microsatellites (2 or 4 nt repeats )except PLA2G4C which is a
minisatellite (26
nt repeat )polymorphism .The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score, amplicon size, and
ease of
interpretation .The backup markers are used if the first line markers at that chromosome arm are
uninformative or
otherwise ambiguous in their interpretation .LOH at all informative loci on each chromosomal arm
represents the
typical finding in oligodendrogliomas with 1 p and 19q deletion.
FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a stand -alone diagnostic

TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT promoter have been shown to
benefit
from therapy with alkylating agents .Assessment of MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite
treatment of DNA followed by real-time PCR amplification of methylated and unmethylated DNA
sequences. The
analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by serial dilution of methylated positive control DNA into
unmethylated DNA, and was assessed to be 11 %of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated
DNA. Factors
such as the presence of >50 %non-neoplastic cells in the sample ,or extensive tissue necrosis, may
preclude the
detection of methylated MGMT promoter sequences.

Addendum Discussion:  
Only a rare MIB -1 positive cell is present, consistent with the low grade histologic 
features. The case is reviewed with who in addition to the astrocytic proliferation, notes disorganiza tion of neurons with some atpyia, as well as neurons and 
white matter, consistent with a background of cortical dysplasia.  
 
Addendum Diagnosis:  
Well- differentiated Astrocytoma, grade II in background of cortical dysplasia.  
 
Microscopic Description:  
Secti ons demonstrate a mildly to moderately hypercellular glial neoplasm that diffusely 
infiltrates white matter as well as gray matter. In the latter, focal perineuronal satellitosis is seen. The tumor predominantly resemble s gemistocytes, although some 
fibrillary astrocytes are seen. Although the nuclei tend to be round to oval, perinuclear halos or other definite indications of oligodendroglioma differentiation are not seen. Atypia is mild to moderate. No mitoses are in seen in 50 high power fields or on lower power scanning.  
  
"," 1. ""Site"": Brain - The report specifically mentions ""Astrocytoma"", which is a type of brain tumor, and the microscopic description supports this.
2. ""Laterality"": Not provided - The report does not specify whether the tumor is located in the left or right hemisphere of the brain.
3. ""Histology"": Astrocytoma, grade II - The report's addendum diagnosis clearly states ""Well-differentiated Astrocytoma, grade II"".
4. ""Stage"": Not provided - The report does not contain enough information to determine the stage of the tumor.
5. ""Grade"": II - As mentioned in the histology, the tumor is a grade II Astrocytoma.
6. ""Behavior"": Malignant - Although the report does not explicitly state this, the fact that it is a grade II Astrocytoma implies malignancy as Astrocytomas are brain tumors and all brain tumors are considered malignant to some degree."

Comment: The histological profile and Ki-67 labelling index are consistent
with a low grade (WHO grade II) glial neoplasm. Though in many areas the
cells assume an oligodendroglial profile, in other areas more pleomorphic
elements with astrocytic appearance are present. More sections as well as
assays for Ip/19q deletions are pending and an addendum will be issued

The resultant FISH section/slide is scanned by a trained licensed
medical technologist and analyzed using a FDA-approved, validated
semi-automated scanning imaging workstation and accompanying imaginglocus of interest.
Number of Observers:
Test Interpreted By:
Comments analysis software .The resultant FISH section/slide is then
presented to the interpreting Pathologist, who will reviews the FISH
results from and compares them to the results manually observed
under Fluorescence Microscope. Therefore the ratio is enumerated
by computer-aided counting as well as manual counting.
Interpretation of Test
The ratio for probe set 1 is derived by dividing the total number of
1p36 signals by the total number of 1g25 signals in at least 20
interphase nuclei with
nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic glial cells. Cells with no
signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. The ratio for
probe set 2 is derived by dividing the total number of 19q13 signals by
the total number of 19p13 signals in at least 2 sets of 20 interphase
nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic glial cells at two
different areas of the sample. Cells with no signals or with signals of
only one color are disregarded. References ranges for our laboratory for
allelic loss versus no allelic loss were established by evaluating both
probe sets in a series of 40 normal cases from 10 different organs. For
both probe set 1 and 2 a ratio of less than 0.80 taken from at least 2 sets
of 20 interphase nuclei at 2 different areas with nonoverlapping nuclei is
consistent with allelic loss.

index: 12%. See Microscopy Description and Comment. 
COMMENT The sections contain portions of an astrocytic neoplastic proliferation that 
infiltrates and extensively effaces the cerebrum. The neoplasm is 
small-celled, and has nuclear anaplastic features, mitotic figures, 
microvascular proliferation with vascular necrosis and thrombosis, and small 
zones of tumor necrosis. The neurons contained within the neoplasm are 
interpreted as non-neoplastic native neurons, and a neuronal component is 
considered unlikely.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY: The GFAP demonstrates glial fibrillogenesis by the 
neoplastic cells. There are non-atypical neuronal elements (positive with 
synaptophysin, chromogranin, and NeuN) focally, in what appears to be cerebral 
cortex. With the MIB-1 there is a proliferation index of about 12% throughout 
the tumor. SPECIAL STAIN: There is no reticulin deposition within the neoplasm. 
The findings are consistent with a high histological grade astrocytic 
neoplasm. The neuronal cells do not appear neoplastic, and are interpreted as 
trapped native neurons.

Clinical History
•year-old man experienced a recent onset seizure and has a left facial droop. On imaging there is
a mass in
the medial and superior temporal lobe that extends into the insula, with mass effect and uncal herniation.
Operative Diagnoses
Benign brain neoplasm.
Operation / Specimen
A: Brain, right temporal lobe, excision biopsy
B: Brain, temporal lobe, excision biopsy
Pathologic Diagnosis
A and B. Brain ,right temporal ,excisional biopsies:
1.Oligodendroglioma, diffusely infiltrating.
2.MIB-1 proliferation index: 3%.
See Microscopy Description and Comment.
Comment
The sections contain portions of cerebral cortex and adjacent white matter that are diffusely and
moderately infiltrated
by a glial neoplastic proliferation made of rather uniform round nuclei, with some perineuronal satellitosis.
The MIB-1
proliferation index is somewhere between 1.5% and 3%. There is not mitotic activity, microvascular
proliferation, or
necrosis.
In this limited sample the neoplasm has a phenotype consistent with an oligodendroglial origin, and is
devoid of
anaplastic features (WHO II).

Loss of Heterozygosity 1 p, 19q Assay (LOH)
Date Ordered: Date Reported:
Surgical Pathology
Page 2 of 4
Interpretation
POSITIVE: Allelic loss on chromosome arm 19q is detected.
Allelic loss on chromosome l p is not detected.
Informative loci are: D1S548, D1 S1592, D1 S552, D19S219, D19S412, and PLA2G4C
Results -Comments
Testing was performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block (B1). H&E stained slide
was examined
and marked by a pathologist for subsequent tumor dissection. Peripheral blood DNA was used for
germline comparison,
TEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA (baseline )/Tumor DNA
pairs using 3
markers at both 1 p and 19q. The 3 markers on l p are D15548 ,D151592, and D15552 (with D15468,
D1S1612, and
D1S496 as backup markers) and the 3 markers on 19q are D19S219 ,D19S412 ,and PLA2G4C (with
D19S606 and
D19S1182 as backup ).Allmarkers are microsatellites (2 or 4 nt repeats )except PLA2G4C which is a
minisatellite (26
nt repeat )polymorphism .The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score ,amplicon size, and
ease of
interpretation .The backup markers are used if the first line markers at that chromosome arm are
uninformative or
otherwise ambiguous in their interpretation .LOH at all informative loci on each chromosomal arm
represents the
typical finding in oligodendrogliomas with 1 p and 19q deletion.
FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a stand-alone diagnostic
test. This test
was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the
as required
by CLIA' 88 regulations .Ithas not been cleared or approved for specific uses by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA). The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These
results are
provided for informational purposes only, and should be interpreted only in the context of established
procedures
and/or diagnostic criteria.
TECHNICAL SENSITIVITY :The presence of >15% non-neoplastic cells in the sample may preclude the
detection of
allelic loss.

DNA followed by real-time PCR amplification of methylated and unmethylated DNA
sequences-The
analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by serial dilution of methylated positive control DNA into
unmethylated DNA, and was assessed to be 1% of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated
DNA. Factors
such as the presence of >50% non-neoplastic cells in the sample, or extensive tissue necrosis, may
preclude the
detection of methylated MGMT promoter sequences.

IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY: The GFAP demonstrates a gliofibrillary background throughout the
specimen, and
numerous reactive astrocytes. About one fourth of neoplastic nuclei over express strongly the p53
protein. With the
MIB-1 the proliferation index of the total number of cells is about 1.5%, perhaps about 3% in the
neoplasm assuming
that one half of nuclei are native non-neoplastic cells.

Justification: The specimen is obtained from the right temporal lobe.

Histology: Astrocytic proliferation, reactive and atypical with undifferentiated cells
Justification: The pathological examination reveals astrocytic proliferation, some of which are reactive and atypical, as well as undifferentiated cells.

Stage: Not provided
Justification: The report does not contain information regarding the stage of the condition.

Grade: Not diagnostic
Justification: The report mentions that the sample is non-diagnostic for astrocytic or oligodendroglial neoplasms, thus a grade cannot be determined.

Behavior: Neoplastic
Justification: The presence of undifferentiated cells and atypical proliferation suggests a neoplastic process."

COMMENT 
In the three specimens there is a glial neoplastic proliferation with 
at. 
overall oligodendroglial phenotype with small proliferation centers, 
but also 
vlith a prominent astrocytic component. Mitotic figures are found with 
difficulty, and the MIB-l proliferation index is low at about 2% in 
the more 
active areas. There is no microvascular proliferation or necrosis. 
In 
specimen C there are some proliferation micro centers, some mitoses, 
and a feYl 
hyalinized vessels. 
The neoplasm is interpreted as a mixed oligoastrocytoma with low 
proliferation 
index WHO II/III. The focal proliferating activity may portend an 
aggressive 
behavior. In the specimens examined there are no cellular anaplastic 
features.  The findings in the biopsy may be correlated Nith clinical, imagingl

TEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA 
(baseline)/ Tumor DNA pairs using 3 markers at both Ip and 19q. The 3 
markers 
on Ip are D1S548, D1S1592, and D1S552 (with D1S468, D1S1612, and 
D1S496 as

PLA2G4C

(2 or 4 
nt repeats) except PLA2G4C which is a minisatellite (26 nt repeat)

amplicon size, and ease of interpretation. The backup markers are used

INTERPRETATION AND DIAGNOSIS:
1-5) BRAIN TUMOR :ANAPLASTIC ASTROCYTOMA, WHO GRADE III, SEE COMMENT.
COMMENT :While some of the lesion is grade II, tissue in 1A has the
cellularity, nuclear atypia, and mitotic activity of a grade III
lesion .The MIB --1 rate is approximately 5%. While there are some
oligodendroglioma features ,i.e. round uniform nuclei and
perivascular haloes ,the tumor, overall .,has features of astrocytoma.
Molecular studies found changes consistent with loss of
heterozygosity on 19q ,but not on lp. As such, the lp/19q codeletion
associated with oligodendroglioma was not present. Isolated loss of
19q is not uncommon in astrocytomas.

Brain ,right temporal ,excision: Mixed oligoastrocytoma ,anaplastic (WHO grade 111).
See Microscopy Description and Comment.
Comment
The sections contain large portions of brain extensively infiltrated and effaced by a very cellular glial
neoplastic
proliferation. The neoplastic cells have a mixed oligo astrocytic phenotype, there is focally brisk mitotic
activity, and
the MIB-1 proliferation index is about 75% in the more active areas .There is also focal endothelial
hyperplasia and
some microvascular proliferation. There are focal areas of necrosis and hemorrhage with some pigment,
most likely
associated wit previous surgical procedure.
The findings are interpreted as those of an anaplastic oligoastrocytoma.

PCR for EGFR variant III mutation
Date Ordered : Date Reported:
Interpretation
Surgical Pathology
Page 2 of 4
NEGATIVE - No evidence of EGFRvIll mutation is detected
Results -Comments
TEST DESCRIPTION: Testing performed on RNA extracted from paraffin tissue block (Al)
H and E slide was examined and no microdissection was needed.
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an attractive molecular target in glioblastoma because it
is amplified,
overexpressed, and/or mutated in up to 40% to 50% of patients. Epidermal growth factor receptor variant
III
(EGFRvIII) is an oncogenic, constitutively active mutant form of EGFR that is commonly expressed in
glioblastoma. Cell culture and in vivo models of glioblastoma have demonstrated EGFRvIII as defining prognostically
distinct
subgroups of glioblastomas .Additionally ,the presence of EGFRvIII has been shown to sensitize tumors
to EGFR
tyrosine kinase inhibitors when the tumor suppressor protein PTEN is intact. RNA is extracted from
formalin fixed,
paraffin embedded tissue samples and reverse transcribed to cDNA. The cDNA is then amplified using
standard PCR
technique for DNA templates. PCR products are detected by gel electrophoresis. The limit of detection of
this assay
has been determined to be approximately 5 mutant cells in 100 normal cells.
FDA Comment :The above data are not to be construed as the results from a stand alone diagnostic test.
This test
was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the
as required
by CLIA '88 regulations. It has not been cleared or approved for specific uses by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA). The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These

Loss of Heterozygosity 1 p, 19q Assay (LOH)
Date Ordered : Date Reported:
Interpretation
NEGATIVE: Allelic loss on chromosome arm 1 p and chromosome arm 19q is NOT detected.
Informative loci are: D1S1612, D1S496, D19S219, D19S412, and PLA2G4C
Results -Comments
Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block (Al). DNA extracted from a
corresponding
blood specimen was used as a normal reference control.
H and E slide was examined and no microdissection was needed.
TEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA (baseline)/ Tumor DNA
pairs using 3
markers at both 1 p and 19q. The 3 markers on 1 p are D1 S548, D1 S1592, and D1 S552 (with D1 S468,
D1 S1612, and
D1S496 as backup markers) and the 3 markers on 19q are D19S219, D19S412, and PLA2G4C (with
D19S606 and
D19S1182 as backup). All markers are microsatellites (2 or 4 nt repeats) except PLA2G4C which is a
minisatellite (26
nt repeat) polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score, amplicon size, and
ease of
interpretation. The backup markers are used if the first line markers at that chromosome arm are
uninformative or
otherwise ambiguous in their interpretation. LOH at all informative loci on each chromosomal arm
represents the
typical finding in oligodendrogliomas with 1 p and 19q deletion.

MGMT Promoter Methylation
Date Ordered : Date Reported:
Interpretation
NEGATIVE: No evidence of methylated MGMT promoter is detected.
Results -Comments
Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block -Al
TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT promoter have been shown to
benefit
from therapy with alkylating agents. Assessment of MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite
treatment of
DNA followed by real-time PCR amplification of methylated and unmethylated DNA
sequences. The
analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by serial dilution of methylated positive control DNA into
unmethylated DNA, and was assessed to be 1% of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated
DNA. Factors
such as the presence of >50% non-neoplastic cells in the sample, or extensive tissue necrosis, may
preclude the
detection of methylated MGMT promoter sequences.
FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a stand alone diagnostic
test. This test

area of increased cellular atypia and cellular density associated with focal microvascular proliferation is
noted. Focal
necrosis is also present. Considering these features, the differential diagnosis includes a high-grade
oligoastrocytoma
in transition to glioblastoma with oligodendroglial component, WHO grade IV. Clinical correlation is
recommended.

CASSETTES: 1-3,
Microscopic Description
IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY: The GFAP demonstrates an overall sparse gliofibrillary back ground. The
CD34
depicts a monotonous capillary-type microvascular network, with a few areas that have endothelial
hyperplasia, and a
couple of areas with few vessels with microvascular cellular proliferation. Many cells weakly over express
the p53
protein, and only a small minority strongly over expresses the protein. With the MIB-1 there is very high
proliferation
index that reaches 75% in the more active areas.

INTERPRETATION 
 
1p intact: A majority of nuclei showed similar numbers of 1p36 and 1q25 signals. There is no evidence of allelic loss on the short arm of chromosome 1 (1p).  19q intact: A majority of nuclei showed similar numbers of 19q13 and 19p13 signals. THere is no evidence of allelic loss of 19q.  Allelic loss at one locus does not necessarily predict the presence of alterations at other loci on the same chromosome, i.e. FISH may not detect partial allelic loss. FISH may not detect allelic losses if there is loss of one allele and replication on the allele.  
Comment:  
Several days after unstained slides from block A2 were received, additional unstained slides from 
block B1 were received. This was discussed with Dr. Mark Cohen on 2011. The unstained slides from 
block B1 will not be stained and will be returned.  
 Allelic loss on chromosome 1p has been shown to correlate with with chemoresponsiveness and long progression-free surival in some gliomas. This correlation is stronger when there is concomitant allelic loss on 19q. An association of chemoresponsiveness and/or long progression-free survivl with allelic loss on 19q in the absence of loss on 1p has not been established. In patients with 1p/19q loss,
 
Method:   
The integrity of the short arm of chromosome 1 (1p) and long arm of chromosome 19 (19q) was 
evaluated with interphase florescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using locus-specific probes target (1p36, 19q13) and reference probes (1q25,19p13) (Abbott Meloecular/Vysis, des Plaines, IL). The analysis was performed on areas of glial neoplasm and only atypical nuclei with two or more reference probe signals were counted. Reported quantitavtive data represents an average of 40 nuclei. Loss is defined as a ratio of less than or eugual to 0.7./ Aneusomy is defined as a mean of greater that or equal to 3.0 for the reference probe signals (1q25, 19p13).

Reviewer !nitiajsDISgt JALIFIFD I. Deep to cyst wall: White matter with cyst wall lined by moderately cellular, viable tumor.
Comment :This astrocytoma diffusely infiltrates white and gray matter. In some areas, especially the cyst
wall, the cells are as^ocjated with prominent microcystic change. Tumor cells have moderately
pleomorphic astrocytic nuclei, some naked and others with gemistocytic cytoplasm; other areas have a
more round, monotonous pattern suggestive of an oligodendroglioma component. Immunostain for p53 is
diffusely positive, however, arguing against an oligodendroglioma. Perineuronal satellitosis is seen. No
evidence of an underlying grade 1 tumor is seen (i.e. no EGBs, Rosethal fibers or noninfiltrative areas).
No mitoses are present. Though the cellularity and pleomorphism are in some areas pronounced, no
mitoses, vascular endothelial proliferation or necrosis are present. Immunostain for MIB-1 (slide C3)
shows a nuclear labeling rate of up to 6% (rates of greater than 3% are considered likely to represent
anaplastic change by Burger et al., Surgical Pathology of the Nervous System and its Coverings, 4th ed.).
Thus the tumor is WHO grade 2, but is likely to represent early anaplastic change .Molecular testing for
MGMT, 1 p 19q are in progress.

MGMT Methylation Assay
Specimen Type
Paraffin Block
Result
Gene Methylation DETECTED.
Methylation of the MGMT (O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyitransferase) gene was detected using methylation specific PCR technologies.
Methylation Score: 5.67
unmethylated <2.00
methylated >=2.00
Background
MGMT (0(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase) is a DNA repair enzyme that is involved in the repair of damage caused by a variety of
DNA crosslinking compounds, including alkylating agents .Increased methylation of the MGMT gene promoter region causes diminished or
silenced expression of the gene ,making cells more sensitive to DNA damage .This relationship has been shown for glioblastomas and
alkylating agents such as Temodar(R)(temozoiomide).
Approximately 40% to 45% of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tumors exhibit MGMT gene methylation .Retrospective studies have shown that
detection of MGMT promoter methylation in tumor samples is associated with an increased likelihood of a favorable response to temozolomide.
Methodology
DNA is Isolated from formalin-fixed, paraffin -embedded (FFPE )specimen .Molecular analysis of the MGMT gene is performed by methylation-
specific PCR and detected on ABI7900 .The MGMT and beta Actin copy numbers will be used to calculate the ratio of MGMT/beta-Actin x1000.
Molecular-based testing Is highly accurate ,but as in any laboratory test, rare diagnostic errors may occur.
Results of this test are for investigational Purposes Only. The performance characteristic of this assay have been determined by The
result should not be used as a diagnostic procedure without confirmation of the diagnosis by another medically established diagnostic product
or procedure.

Justification: The tissue samples received are labeled with the patient's name and terms related to brain cyst walls and deep brain tissue.

Laterality: Not provided
Justification: The report does not mention any laterality information regarding the tissue samples.

Histology: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)
Justification: The MGMT methylation assay was performed on a paraffin block of glioblastoma, which is a type of brain tumor known as GBM.

Stage: Not applicable
Justification: Staging is not typically applied to brain tumors like GBM. Instead, they are graded based on their characteristics and malignancy.

Grade: High-grade glioma (presumed)
Justification: The presence of MGMT gene methylation in the tissue sample suggests a high-grade glioma, such as GBM, which is a highly malignant brain tumor.

Behavior: Malignant
Justification: GBM is a highly aggressive and malignant type of brain cancer with poor prognosis."
brain,left,,,,,TCGA-HT-A74H.pdf,"Pathology Report for Date of Surgery:
Diagnosis:
Left temporal brain tumor
Anaplastic astrocytoma, grade 3
P53: focally positive
IDH1: Negative
MIB-1 LI: 13.3%
Discussion:940113,J65
Zy""""` I!e
The neoplastic cells are negative for IDH1 with a minority expressing p53. MIB-1
reactivity areas are seen within the tumor but in the most proliferative areas a labeling
index of 13.3% is calculated, consistent with a high grade astrocytoma.
Microscopic Description:
Sections demonstrate a diffusely infiltrative astrocytic neoplasm. Atypia ranges from
mild to moderate. There is mild to moderate hypercellularity. The tumor cells resemble
fibrillary astrocytes. Some areas are suggestive, but not definitive, for perinuclear halos.
A careful examination only reveals a rare mitotic figure. There is no microvascular
proliferation or necrosis.xz V .t 3

OF _ HAS BEE:N CHANG['D. 
BRAIN, RIGHT TEMPORAL LOBE, BIOPSY: SMALL CELL GLIOMA (TO BE FURTHER 
CLASSIFIED; SEE MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION): 
REVISED PATHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS: 
BRAIN, RIGHT TEMPORAL LOBE, BIOPSY: ASTROCYTOMA, ANAPLASTIC, 
DIFFUSELY INFILTRATING. 
Operation/Specimen: Brain, right temporal lobe. 
Clinical History and Pre-Op Dx: Patient with several month history of 
visual disturbances and headaches who has a CT scan lesion involving 
the right temporal lobe and extending across the midline to the left 
hemisphere. The differential diagnosis is between lymphoma and a 
glioma. 
,u>'~""~rIVE CONSULTATION: Astrocytoma, anaplastic 
GROSS PATHOLOGY: Specimen received in a container labeled with the 
patient's name and MRN. A portion of this specimen is used for the 
intraoperative consultation and for fixation in glutaraldehyde for 
eventual electron microscopy. The total amount of tissue removed 
equals 
approximately 5.0 9 and all remaining fragments are submitted in six 
tissue cassettes. 
MICROSCOPIC: Fragments of cerebral cortex and underlying white matter 
showing multiple, focal and diffuse infiltrates by small neoplastic 
cells that in general lack differentiation. In many areas the cells 
surrund individual neurons and in small sites they show some degree of 
cytoplasmic differentiation which appears similar to that of an 
astrocyte. There are mUltiple perivascular nests of neoplastic cells. 
Areas of coagUlation necrosis or atypical mitosis are not readily 
identified, however the general impression is that this pattern of 
tissue infiltrate may represent distant extension of a rather 
aggressive type of undifferentiated neoplasm. 
In summary, the impression formed at the time of the intraoperative 
consultation that this represents a small cell glioma with very 
anaplastic features is sustained by the evidence available at this  time. In an attempt to further identify the genetic derivation of 
these cells additional sections will be cut and reacted with various 
antisera as follows: GFAP, LCA, EMA, CK-6, Synaptophysin and MIB-1. 
In addition one of the samples taken for electron microscopy will be 
evaluated. 
An addendum will be issued when all of these are completed. 
COMMENT: Additional sections were cut from several blocks and reacted 
with the following antisera: LCA, EMA, CK-6, and Synaptophysin; these 
are negative in all the neoplastic cells. These results are 
interpreted as confirming the initial impression that the derivation 
of 
these cells is not from lymphocytes, neuronal elements, or epithelial 
cells. GFAP is expressed by approximately 20% of the neoplastic 
cells. 
MIB-1: This protein is expressed by diverse percentages of cells in 
various locations; however! the mean percentage of cells expressing 
this protein is estimated to be about 10%. 
Sections evaluated with the electron microscope confirm the impression 
that the cytoplasmic features as well as the nuclei of most neoplastic 
cells are compatible with those characteristic of a neoplastic 
astrocyte. 
A letter from Dr. 
in agreement with 
involuntary delay in the issuance of this final report represents a 
combination of simultaneous events including my absence from the 
department for over two weeks, and the fact that the slides were is 
mailed 
to Dr. IIIIIIIfor consultation before dictating the addendum, and his 
reply was not opportunely delivered to the pathologist on call during 
my absence . ....

Gross Description
A single specimen is received in formalin labeled with the patient's name,medical
record number and ""#1 left temporal tumor"". The specimen consists of three,
unoriented tan-white to graytissue fragments, grossly consistent with brain tissue
measuring 3.0 x 2.5 x 1.0 cm. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal no
focal lesions. Submitted entirely in cassettes 1A-1B.
Microscopic Examination
Sections show foci of increased cellularity within gray and white matter. The foci
have infiltrative borders and are composed of cells with irregularly shaped nuclei
and moderate amounts of eosinophilic cytoplasm. Frequent pleomorphic,
hyperchromatic, and occasional multinucleated cells are present.No significant
mitotic figures, necrosis or vascular proliferation with hyperplasia is identified.
immunohistochemical stains are performed with appropriately reactive positive and
negative controls and show the neoplastic cells to be positive for GFAP and
negative for synaptophysin and NeuN.

RESULTS 
 
 Chromosome 1p: Intact, aneusomic  Chromosome 19q: Intact, eusomic   
Quantitative FISH results 
 
1p36:3.3 1q25:3.2 1p36/1q25 ratio: 1.0  19q13:2.0 19q13: 2.5 19q13/19p13 ratio: 0.8  
INTERPRETATION 
  
 
1p intact: A majority of nuclei showed similar numbers of 1p36 and 1q25 signals. There is no evidence of allelic loss on the short arm of chromosome 1 (1p).  19q intact: A majority of nuclei showed similar numbers of 19q13 and 19p13 signals. There is no evidence of allelic loss of 19q.  Allelic loss at one locus does not necessarily predict the presence of alterations at other loci on the same chromosome, i.e. FISH may not detect partial allelic loss. FISH may not detect allelic losses if there is loss of one allele and replication on the allele.  
Comment:  
Allelic loss on chromosome 1p has been shown to correlate with with chemoresponsiveness and long 
progression-free survival in some gliomas. This correlation is stronger when there is concomitant 
allelic loss on 19q. An association of chemoresponsiveness and/or long progression-free survival with allelic loss on 19q in the absence of loss on 1p has not been established. In patients with 1p/19q loss,
 
Method:   
The integrity of the short arm of chromosome 1 (1p) and long arm of chromosome 19 (19q) was 
evaluated with interphase florescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using locus-specific probes target (1p36, 19q13) and reference probes (1q25,19p13) (Abbott Melecular/Vysis, des Plaines, IL). The analysis was performed on areas of glial neoplasm and only atypical nuclei with two or more reference probe signals were counted. Reported quantitative data represents an average of 40 nuclei. Loss is defined as a ratio of less than or equal to 0.7./ Aneusomy is defined as a mean of greater that or equal to 3.0 for the reference probe signals (1q25, 19p13).

A. AND B. BRAIN, LEFT, EXCISIONAL BIOPSIES: OLIGODENDROGLIOMA,
MIB-l LABELING INDEX < 1.0%.
SEE MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION AND COMMENT.
----------------------------------------------------------------Operation/Specimen: Brain.
Clinical History and Pre-Op Dx:year old woman with diagnosis 6
months ago of oligodendroglioma. For extensive resection.
GROSS PATHOLOGY: -
A. ""left tumor"", received fresh, one fragment, 0.8 cm. across.
Semifirm, pinkish-gray. In total #1.
INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION: Brain, left: glioma, low grade,
consistent with oligodendroglioma.
B. ""left tumor"", one fragment, 0.7 cm. across. Soft, pinkish-gray. In
total #2.
INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION: Brain, left: glioma, low grade,
consistent with oligodendroglioma.
MICROSCOPIC: A. and B. Portions of a moderately cellular neoplastic
glial proliferation, in which the cells display uniform round nuclei.
There is moderate nuclear pleomorphism and nuclear hyperchromasia. The
background is finely fibrillary, and the vascular network consists of
capillary-type vessels. Gliofibrillary oligodendrocytes and
minigemistocytes are rarely observed. There are no mitotic figures,
and areas of necrosis or microvascular cellular proliferation are not
observed.
SPECIAL STAINS: Immunoperoxidase methods for GFAP, synaptophysin, and
MIB-1 are performed on block #2.
With the GFAP the tumor cells are not immunoreactive. No tumor cells
immunoreact with synaptophysin. With the MIB-l a labeling index of
less than 1% is determined.
COMMENT: The neoplasm is a low grade glioma with uniform round
neoplastic nuclei, absent features of anaplasia, and a low MIB-l
labeling index of less than 1%. The nuclear pleomorphism is moderate
and consistent with a Smith's grade B.

Microscopic Description:  
Sections demonstrate a moderately hypercellular glial neoplasm. There is extensive 
infiltration through both gray and white matter. In the gray matter, perineuronal satellitosis is s triking. In the unfrozen material, most of the tumor cells are seem to have 
perinuclear halos. They have round nuclei with moderate atypia. No mitotic figures are seen. There is no microvascular proliferation or necrosis.  
 
Addendum Discussion:  
The calculated MIB -1 labeling index ranges up to 5.0% in the most proliferative regions 
of tumor. A MIB-1 labeling index of 5.0% is considered borderline by some studies for grade II and grade II oligodendrogliomas. The low grade features exhibited by this oligodendroglioma are more consistent with a grade II tumor; however, in light of the borderline MIB-1 index, this neoplasm should be closely followed for anaplastic progression and/or recurrence.

 Addendum Diagnosis : Right frontal brain tumor, including inferior medial frontal lobe 
region: Oligodendroglioma with focal anaplastic progression (grade III).  
- MIB-1 labeling index: 8.2%  
 Microscopic Description : Sectio ns of the right frontal tumor demonstrate a diffusely 
moderately hypercellular neoplasm composed of mildly to moderately atypical 
oligodendrocytes. No microvascular proliferation or necrosis is seen. The tumor diffusely 
infiltrates both the gray and white matter. There is a generally consistent cellularity. However, slide 4B demonstrates nodular foci with both greater cellularity and atypia. In one of these regions 6 mitoses are seen in 10 high power fields. Overall, this pattern is consistent with early anaplastic progression of an underlying low grade oligodendroglioma. Sections of the inferior medial frontal lobe tumor also demonstrate a diffuse, moderately cellular oligodendroglioma. Here, again, there are nodular foci with greater cellularity. However, only 1 mitosis is identified in 30 high power fields in this region.  
"," 1. ""Site"": Right frontal brain. Justified as the report clearly mentions the tumor's location as the right frontal brain.
2. ""Laterality"": Not provided. The report does not mention any laterality for the oligodendroglioma, only specifying the frontal lobe.
3. ""Histology"": Oligodendroglioma. As stated in the report, the tumor is identified as an oligodendroglioma.
4. ""Stage"": Not provided. The TNM stage is not specified in this report.
5. ""Grade"": Grade III. The report clearly states the grade of the tumor as III, indicating focal anaplastic progression.
6. ""Behavior"": Malignant. This is justified by the presence of mitoses and cellular atypia, indicating malignancy."

Comment
Permanent sections confirm the frozen section diagnosis and show a gemistocytic astrocytoma.
Intermingled with
nodules of medium large gemistocytes are ares of tightly packed ,higher -grade pleomorphic astrocytoma
nuclei with .
indistinct cytoplasm .Mitotic figures are easily identified .Vascular proliferation and necrosis are not seen.
The tissue fragments are relatively small, therefore a higher -grade lesion ,e.g. glioblastoma ,WHO grade
IV, cannot
be completely ruled out due to sampling phenomena .Clinical correlation is recommended.
The patient's tumor bank slide was also reviewed. Results of ancillary studies will be reported

Interpretation
NEGATIVE - No evidence of EGFRvIII mutation is detected
Results -Comments TEST DESCRIPTION :Testing performed on RNA extracted from paraffin tissue block
T(A2)
he epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an attractive molecular target in glioblastoma because it
is amplified,
overexpressed, and/or mutated in up to 40% to 50% of patients .Epidermal growth factor receptor variant
III
(EGFRvIII )is an oncogenic ,constitutively active mutant form of EGFR that is commonly expressed in
glioblastoma.
Cell culture and in vivo models of glioblastoma have demonstrated EGFRvIII as defining prognostically
distinct
subgroups of glioblastomas .Additionally ,the presence of EGFRvIII has been shown to sensitize tumors
to EGFR
tyrosine kinase inhibitors when the tumor suppressor protein PTEN is intact .RNA is extracted from
formalin fixed,
paraffin embedded tissue samples and reverse transcribed to cDNA. The cDNA is then amplified using
standard PCR
technique for DNA templates .PCR products are detected by gel electrophoresis. The limit of detection of
this assay
has been determined to be approximately 5 mutant cells in 100 normal cells.
FDA Comment :The above data are not to be construed as the results from a stand alone diagnostic test.
This test

Interpretation
NEGATIVE: No evidence of methylated MGMT promoter is detected.
Results -Comments
Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block (A2)
H and E slide was examined and no microdissection was needed.
TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT promoter have been shown to
benefit
from therapy with alkylating agents. Assessment of MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfate
treatment of
DNA followed by real-time PCR amplification of methylated and unmethylated DNA
sequences. The
analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by serial dilution of methylated positive control DNA into
unmethylated DNA, and was assessed to be 1 % of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated
DNA. Factors

such as the presence of >50% non -neoplastic cells in the sample ,or extensive tissue necrosis, may
preclude the
detection of methylated MGMT promoter sequences.

IDHI/IDH2 Mutation Detection Assay
Date Ordered : Date Reported:
Interpretation
NEGATIVE - There is no evidence of IDH1 point mutation, as indicated by the absence of any nucleotide
changes in
codon 132 of the IDHI gene compared to the electropherogram of the reference normal sample (wild
type).
Results -Comments
TEST DESCRIPTION: IDH1/2 Mutation Analysis
Test performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block (A2)
H and E slide was examined and no microdissection was needed.
Mutation of IDH1 occurs early in glioma progression with somatic mutations of the R132 residue of IDH1
identified in
majority (>70%) of grades II and III astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas, as well as in secondary GBMs
that
developed from these lower grade lesions. Mutation analysis of closely related IDH2 revealed mutations
of IDH2
residue R172, with most mutations occurring in tumors lacking IDH1 mutations. Tumors with IDH1 or
IDH2 mutations
have distinctive genetic and clinical characteristics, and patients with such tumors have a better outcome
than those
with wild type IDH genes.
Mutations in IDH1/2 are detected by DNA sequencing procedures. The limit of detection of standard
bidirectional
sequencing is approximately 20-25%. In order to increase assay sensitivity tumor enrichment must be
performed by
manual microdissection when tumor cells in the block constitute less than 50% of nucleated cells.
FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a stand alone diagnostic

The sample consists of a fragment of soft tissue measuring 3.5 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm. Microscopic examination reveals features consistent with a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST), WHO Grade III. No specific sites of origin are identified, but the lesion is abutting and possibly arising from a nerve bundle. There is no evidence of residual schwannoma or neurofibroma within this sample. The specimen shows focal areas of tumor necrosis. Mitotic activity is brisk (>10 mitoses/10 high power fields). Surgical margins are widely involved by the tumor. No lymphovascular invasion is identified.

1. ""Site"": not provided, as the report does not specify a clear site of origin for the tumor.
2. ""Laterality"": not provided, as the report does not mention whether the tumor is on the left or right side.

OPERATIVE DIAGNOSES 
Brain tumor-craniotomy 
0peration/Specimen: A: Brain,right frontal lesion, biopsy 
; Brain, right frontal lesion, biopsy 
PATHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS: 
Brain, right frontal, excisional biopsies: 
1. Malignant glioma, pleomorphic, superficial (WHO III). 
2. MIB-l proliferation index: 35%. 
See Microscopy Description and Comment. 
COMMENT 
The neoplasm is a malignant proliferation of spindle/epithelioid cells that 
have prominent pleomorphism, focally brisk mitotic activity, and a high MIB-l 
proliferation index of about 35% throughout. The tumor is superficial, is 
growing focally in the leptomeningeal space, and has a prominent reticulin 
network. The tumor heavily infiltrates the brain, at its margins has 
astrocytic differentiation, and contains numerous eosinophilic granular 
bodies. Xanthomatous cells are found occasionally. 
Overall, the histological features are more consistent with an anaplastic 
pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (PXA) , in spite of the paucity of GFAP 
expression, a feature that has been observed in some PXAs, particularly when 
transformed into anaplastic tumors. The possibility of this tumor being a 
gliosarcorna has been considered; however the absence of a clear sarcomatous 
pattern, microvascular cellular proliferation, and tumor necrosis does not 
support that diagnosis at this point. 
The features in the biopsy may be correlated with clinical, imaging, and 
~oerative findings for their final interpretation and patient's follow up.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION 
IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY: The GFAP demonstrates paucity of fibrillary processes 
in the bulk of the neoplasm, where there are only small islands of 
gliofibrillogenesis; focally, where the tumor is infiltrative there is also 
gliofibrillogenesis by the neoplastic cells; these areas are also positive 
with S100, synaptophysin, MAP2, and NFP. Many cells throughout the tumor are 
positive with KPI. SMA, HHF35, and CD34 depict leptomeningeal vessel, and a 
microvasculature devoid of microvascular cellular proliferation. The neoplasm 
is negative with vimentin, EMA, cytokeratin, desruin, and C099.
