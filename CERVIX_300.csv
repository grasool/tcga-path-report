REVIEWED BY: INTRAOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
FSA:Uterus: Extensive necrotic tumor, uterus and cervix. Gross
examination only. (M)
CLINICAL INFORMATION: stage 1 B2 adenosquamous
carcinoma of the cervix.
GROSS DESCRIPTION: Number of specimen containers: five, each labeled with
patient name and MRN
M.
A.Container designation: ""uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries""
--Received unfixed is a radical hysterectomy specimen consisting of
uterus, cervix, attached bilateral adnexa and parametrial tissue weighing
260 gm, measuring 13.5 x 6.5 x 6.0 cm. The anterior serosa is smooth, the
posterior serosa demonstrates a firm subserosal yellow-gray mass in the
body measuring 4.5 x 2.9 x 1.0 cm. Surfacing the serosa and the mass is a
1.0 x 0.8 x 0.6 cm cystic structure occupied by clear watery fluid. The
posterior serosa and soft tissue margins are inked. The ectocervix is
pink-tan with purpuric changes surrounding the os 1.0 cm (tumor?) and an
anterior/posterior vaginal identified 1.0 and 0.8 cm in Length,
respectively. Sectioning of the anterior cervix at the os is grossly
unremarkable, however, the tumor extends from within 0.9 cm of the
anterior cervical os to the fundus and appears full thickness in the lower
uterine segment and body. The posterior aspect is similar in appearance
to that of the anterior aspect. Sectioning of the tumor demonstrates a
yellow-gray purulent appearance with prominent necrosis. Representative
sections of tumor and normal are submitted to
n. The right ovary
measures 2.2 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm and sectioning demonstrates a thickened cortex
and pink-tan mottled stroma. The pink-tan fallopian tube with fimbriated
end measures 5.5 cm in length, 0.6 cm in external diameter and sectioning
demonstrates a pink-tan mottled stroma. The left ovary measures 3.0 x 1.5
x 1.0 cm and sectioning demonstrates a pink-tan mottled stroma. The
corresponding pink-tan fallopian tube with fimbriated end measures 6.0 cm
in length, 0.5 cm in external diameter and sectioning demonstrates a
pinpoint lumen. Sections are submitted as follows: cassette Al-posterior
body, serosa with nodule extruding; cassette A2-representative
anterior/posterior vaginal cuff (anterior inked red, posterior green); A3- anterior cervix and ectocervix full thickness; cassette A4-anterior
endocervical canal full thickness; cassette A5-posterior cervix full
thickness with ectocervix; cassette A6-posterior endocervical canal;
cassette A7-anterior body; cassette
A8-posterior body full thickness; cassette A9-anterior fundus full

multiple portions of fat aggregating to 3.5 x 3 x 1.5 cm. Five possible
lymph nodes are identified upon sectioning, the largest measuring 1.7 cm.
The lymph nodes are entirely submitted as follows: B'- '-BS-one bisected
lymph node in each.
C.Container designation: ""Left pelvic lymph node"" - Received are
multiple portions of fat aggregating to 4 x 3 x 1 cm. Eight possible
lymph nodes are identified upon sectioning, the largest measuring 1.5 cm.
The lymph nodes are entirely submitted as follows: Cl-four lymph nodes in
toto, C2-C4-one bisected lymph node in each, C5-four possible lymph nodes
in toto.
D.Container designation: ""Right periaortic lymph node"" - Received are
three lymph nodes, the largest measuring 2 x 0.7 x 0.2 cm. The lymph
nodes are entirely submitted from Dl to D3, each containing one bisected
lymph node.
E.Container designation: ""Sigmoid adhesion"" - Received is a portion of
gray-tan membranous tissue measuring 2 x 0.6 x 0.1 cm, bisected and
entirely submitted in El.

Justification: The tumor was found in the cervix, as indicated by the report.

Laterality: Left
Justification: The left perimetrium (outer part of the uterus) had metastatic squamous cell carcinoma, indicating that the primary tumor was located on the same side.

Histology: Squamous cell carcinoma
Justification: The report specifically mentions squamous cell carcinoma as the type of cancer present.

Stage: FIGO Stage IIB (LIB)
Justification: According to the FIGO staging system for cervical cancer, stage IIB indicates that the tumor has extended beyond the cervix but not to the pelvic wall or lower third of the vagina. The report mentions that the tumor extends from 3 o'clock to 9 o'clock and involves the posterior cervix, which supports this staging.

Grade: Poorly differentiated (High grade squamous intraepithelial lesion)
Justification: The report describes the tumor as poorly differentiated and having high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, indicating a high-grade cancer.

Behavior: Malignant
Justification: The report indicates that the patient was diagnosed with cervical cancer, which is by definition a malignant neoplasm.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Microscopic Description and Comment
Histologic section of the cervical biopsy shows a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma. The predominant pattern of this
tumor is villoglandular papillary adenocarcinoma with fibrovascular cores of variable lengths lined by neoplastic
epithelium that exhibits predominantly intestinal-type differentiation. Dispersed throughout the villoglandular
adenocarcinoma are areas showing complex cribriform architecture. These cribriform areas represent about 10-15%
of lesional tissue . Although stromal invasion is not definitively identified, there is essentially no normal stroma present
within the biopsy tissue to exclude an invasive component. Dr.has reviewed this case and concurs.

W.D. / 4 M.D.
Microscopic Description and Comment:
Sections of the cervix show a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma of endometrioid type with focal squamous
differentiation. Only rare foci of lymphovascular invasion are noted. The maximum depth of tumor invasion in the cervix
is 0.5 cm out of a cervical wall thickness of 1.2 cm. The tumor also extends into the lower uterine segment where the
maximum depth of tumor invasion, seen in the anterior half, measures 0.9 cm out of a total myometrial thickness of 1.2
cm. Even though there is extension of tumor into the lower uterine segment, thg fact that the bulk of the tumor is within
the endocervix is consistent with a cervical rather than an endometrial origin.

The patient is a A*year old woman with a history of
adenocarcinoma.

f ^yt; COMMENT
The ""uterine curettings ""consists of fragments of
endometrium and endocervix admixed with fragments of a
well-differentiated adenocarcinoma . The endometriaâ€¢1 fragments
show the effects of progestogen administration ;the g land sare
small, sparse, and lined by a layer of simple columnar epithelium.
A few glandular mitoses are presen t
strcna.eglandsa^;dCtvc^1110yrudimentary secretory changes.
pseudodecidualized with. a focal stronial chron ic in.Elaiuuatory
infiltrate and ectatic blood vessels . Focally, there is gland and
sttgmal reakdown. The separ .ate_..fra â€¢gments of adenocarc i.noma are
well -diffferentia^ed .The lesion exhibits both glandula rand
villous /papillary architecture .The tumor cells exhibit prominent
intracyto plasmic mucin as well as abundant extracellular mucin
production. Multiple fragments of endocervix with focal squamous
metaplasia are admixed . One, ,of these small endocervical fragments
is partially replaced by markedly atypical glandular eplthel,iu.rn'
suggestive of adenocarcinoma in situ. There is one tiny clump of
fl dysplastic squamous epithelium' Th subsequently performed.c. shows a fragment 01:cervical biopsy from 3 o'clock
adenocarcinoma with histologic and cytologic features identical to
those noted above .The cervical biopsy from 12 o'clock performed
at the sametitne shows mild c7,ysplasia (CIN J), chronic
inflammation and marked hyperkeratosis .The left ovarian cyst
is a corpus luteum cyst ,and there are a few surface
fibrous adhesions on the ovary.
While there is no completely reliable way of assigning origin
( endocervix /endometrium) to a mucinous lesion of this type on thu
basis of its,h'astologic apearance alone, this patient's young age,
lack of associated endometrial hyperplasia, and suggestion of
adenocarcinoma in situ would all favor an endocervical o) i.g.1n for
this lesion. Surg. Path. No.:

Microscopic Description and Comment
Histologic sections from both superior and inferior cervical biopsies show invasive adenocarcinoma, moderately
differentiated.The morphologic features are distorted in much of these specimens by extensive cautery effect. Where
relatively well preserved, the tumor invades as large nests of moderately pleomorphic cells with abundant mucinous
cytoplasm and a high mitotic rate. This tumor is best classified as mucinous adenocarcinoma of endocervical type,
although many of the cells have signet ring features and there are small foci of endometrioid differentiation as well.
Tumor is present on virtually every section from these large biopsies and is present at multiple inked and cauterized
margins. Detached fragments of adenocarcinoma are present in the endocervical canal biopsy.
History
The patient is a year old woman with cervical cancer.

Suctions of the cervical biopsy show Invasive squamous cell carcinoma. The invading cells am arranged in smog nets
and show large nuclei ,pale-staining chromatin, and nudeoti. intercellular bridged am seen among some of the cells.
Mitotic activity is frequent The Invasive tumor Is found beneath unr emarkable squamous epithetlum .One piece of thebiopsy shows foca lkollocytio atypia and mild dysplesle (CINI) invojving the surface, however Is not connected to the
squamous carcinoma.
Sections of the endocervical curettage material show .In addition to benign endocervicel tissue, small ,detachedfragments of dysptastic squamous epithelium .Because the fragments are small. poorly-oriented ,and not associatedwith stme ,it is impossible to grade the dysplesia.

The tumor measures 1.4 cm in greatest lateral dimension and 0 .9 cm In depth ,as mi asured fror>o histologic sections,

however, the tumor may be larger than this given that the resection margins are positive. Lymphvascular space
invasion is Identified. The surface epithelicxn aclacent to invasive cancer shows severe dysplasia (CIN 3). The
specimen labeled posterior cul-de-sac biopsy contains a very small fragment of invasive squamous cell carcinoma. The
iandocervical curettage specimen also contains fragments of invasive squamous cell carcinoma.
liisidlogic.sections from the right ovarian biopsy show two fragments of tissue. One contains what appears to be
'ovatian* cc rtex but which lacks any follicles. A small amount of smooth muscle Is present as well as some apparent
over ail surface epithelium. This may represent a portion of cortex adhesed to adnexal soft tissue. The other fragment
shows fibrous connective tissue with benign appearing squamous epithelium. I cannot confirm that this piece of tissue
originates from the ovary. The specimen labeled ""left adnexal biopsyt Is composed of inflamed connective tissue with
smooth muscle and serosai. No definitive ovarian tissue or follicle formation is present. No malignancy is Identified in
either of these ovarian specimens.

Laterality: Not provided
Histology: Keratinizing subtype squamous cell (epidermoid) carcinoma, invasive type
Stage: IS (Insufficient data to assign stage)
Grade: Nuclear grade 2 (Moderate differentiated)
Behavior: Malignant neoplasm present, involves lower segment of the uterus and vagina, widespread lymphatic invasion by tumor.

Justification: The maximum depth of tumor invasion is 15 mm, and the breadth of the tumor is 37 mm. Two out of 19 regional lymph nodes are metastatically involved, but extracapsular extension of metastatic tumor through the lymph node capsule is absent. The status of distant metastases cannot be assessed due to insufficient data. Invasive tumor is present in the separately submitted specimen of ""left vaginal margin,"" indicating that the extent of vaginal involvement cannot be determined from pathologic information.

DIAGNOSIS:
1:UTERUS AND VAGINAL CUFF, RADICAL HYSTERECTOMY:
-Invasive, poorly differentiated s amour cell carcinoma of
cervix, mike non- eratinizing and keratinizing types (see
comment)
-Involvement of cervix by carcinoma is circumferential
-Tumor measures about 3.5 cm in diameter, about 2 cm in
maximum thickness and involves about a 3.5 cm long segment of
tissue extending from the lower uterine segment to the
vaginal cuff
-Invasion of the cervical wall by tumor is transmural
-A 2.5 x 1.0 cm transmural cervical wall defect involving the
anterior endocervix is present
-Tumor invades paracervical soft tissues (so-called
paracervical parametrium) and focally extends to the
margin of the paracervical soft tissues
-Lymphatic invasion by tumor is present within lower uterine
segment, cervix, vaginal cuff, and paracervical soft tissues
-Vascular (arterial and venous) invasion by tumor is present
in cervix
-Tumor invades the wall of the upper vagina (vaginal cuff)
anteriorly and posteriorly
-Invasive carcinoma is present less than 0.5 mm from the
inked deep margin of the wall of the anterior vaginal cuff,
about 2 mm from the inferior surgical margin of the
anterior vaginal cuff, and within less than 5 mm of the
posterior vaginal cuff
-Involvement of the wall of the lower uterine segment by tumor
is nearly transmural, anteriorly
-Involvement of the posterior wall of the lower uterine
segment is about 50% of the thickness
-Uterine corpus and fundus are negative for carcinoma
-Mucosal surface of the tumor is extensively ulcerated
-Endocervical canal is obstructed by tumor (near total
stenosis)
-Acute and chronic inflammatory reaction and fibrosing stromal
reaction to invasive carcinoma are present
-Tumor associated necrosis is present
-Other findings include:
-Benign non-phasic endometrium (non-functional basalis
endometrium, weakly proliferative endometrium, and some
endometrium showing secretory glandular changes)
-Uterine leiomyoma
-Subserosal mullerianosis (endosalpingiosis), posterior
lower uterine segment

COMMENT:The non-keratinizing component of the tumor predominates.
No intracytoplasmic mucin is detected within the neoplastic cells
on mucicarmine stains.Elastin and trichrome stainswereused to
further investigate the blood vessel invasion by tumor. The
transmural defect in the uterine wall may have been produced by a
combination of factors including transmural wall involvement by
invasive carcinoma, tumor perforation, and technical difficulties in
removing the specimens due to adhesions to surrounding structures.

1:UTERUS AND CERVIX
Labeled ""uterus and cervix"", received fresh in the Operating Room and
subsequently fixed in formalin, is a 100 gram radical hysterectomy
specimenwith an attached 1.5 to 2.5 cm long cuff of superior vaginal
tissue and paracervical/paracorporal parametrial soft tissues,
measuring up to about 1.8 cm in width. The uterusmeasures about 8
cm from the fundus to the ectocervix, 5 cm from cornu to cornu, and
a maximumof 5 cm from the anterior to the posterior surface.
External examination of thespecimen is remarkable for a 2.5 x 1.0 cm
transmural defect with an irregular shaggy border involving the
anterior endocervix. The margins of the tissues bordering the
defect are inked blue.The rest of the serosal surface of the
uterus is tan-pink, intact, and relatively smooth. The paracervical
soft tissuesare focally involved by tumor. The margin of the
of the vaginal cuff is painted with black ink. The cervix is
virtually replaced by an exophytic and endophytic tumor that focally
protrudes through the external os. The tumor is circumferential,
about 3.5 cm in diameter, and involves about a 3.5 cm long segment
of tissue extending from the lower uterine segment into the wall
of the upper vagina. The mucosal aspect of the tumor is amber-
tan to reddish-tan and ulcerated. The endocervical canal shows
subtotal stenosiswith obstruction due to occupation by tumor.On
cut sections, the tumor involves the entire wall of the cervix and
has a maximum thickness of about 2.0 cm. Invasion of the wall of
the anterior lower uterine segment by tumor is also nearly full
thickness.Invasion of the wall of the posterior lower uterine
segment is less.The tumor invades the wall of the upper vagina.
Involvement of the vaginal wall is nearly full thickness. Tumor
within the wall of the vagina extends very close to the vaginal cuff
margin, inferiorly.The overlying vaginal mucosa is tan-pink and
appears grossly uninvolved by tumor. Little, grossly uninvolved
tan, intact squamous epithelium is grossly evident in the cervix.
As stated above, the endocervix is virtually replaced by tumor. The
endometrial cavity is about 4 cm in length and has a maximum width
of about 2.5 cm. The endometrium lining the uterine corpus and
fundus is tan, smooth and has a maximum thickness of about 0.1 cm.
The uterine wall measures about 2.2 cm in maximum thickness. Cut

MICROSCOPIC EXAM:
Sections of the cervical tumor show nests of malignant
cells. The nests appear to be infiltrating cervical glands
and there are bands of collagen surrounding many of the
nests. The malignant cells are somewhat radially located
around the edges of the nests. Central necrosis within the
https:/ â€¢'.. -Clinical Document: I Page 2 of 3
nests is prominent. The tumor cells have a high nuclear to
cytoplasmic ratio with nuclei containing loose chromatin and
small nucleoli. Mitotic figures are abundant.
GROSS DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received fresh in five containers bearing
the patient' s name and hospital number.
Part #1, labeled ""uterus and cervix,"" consists of a 1128-gm
uterus and cervix with no attached adnexa. The uterus
measures 14.5 cm from cornu to cornu, 17 cm from cervical os
to top of fundus, and 9 cm from anterior to posterior. A
probe extends into the cervical os 14.5. The cervix is
round with a defect in the posterior 6 o'clock position.
The defect appears to be within a lesion that is 3.5 cm from
lateral to lateral and is 2 cm from anterior to posterior
and involves the entire posterior aspect of the cervix. The
defect appears as a chunk out of this lesion that is 1.5 cm
deep and 1.5 cm on its side. The cervix itself is 5 cm from
lateral to lateral and 4 cm anterior to posterior. There is
2 cm of attached vaginal wall that is attached from the 6
o'clock to the 9 o'clock position. On the anterior and left
side there is approximately 1 cm of attached vaginal wall.
The serosa on the uterus is pink and unremarkable. The left
parametrium is inked with black ink and the right
parametrium is inked with green ink. Upon opening the
uterus, the cervical canal measures 3.5 cm and the
endometrial cavity is 10.5 cm vertically and 7 cm at its
widest point. The endometrial cavity is covered with a
boggy, hemorrhagic-appearing endometrium. The myometrium is
thick and boggy-appearing. The maximum thickness is 3.5 cm.
The cervix is dissected away from the specimen and entirely
submitted as follows:
Al-A6 12 o'clock to 3 o'clock
A7-A13 3o'clock to 6 o'clock
A14-A24 6o'clock to 9 o'clock
A25-A30 9 o'clock to 12 o'clock
A31-A36 right parametrium
A37-A39 left parametrium
A40-A47 uterus

COMMENT: The invasive carcinoma exhibits predominantly features
of non-keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma. A few of the nests of
tumor cells have lumen-like spaces (? true lumens versus artifacts
related to tumor cell necrosis). No mucicarminophilic mucin is
detected in the neoplastic cells and only very rare tumor cells
contain PAS-positive, diastase-resistant mucin and/or Alcian blue
PAS-positive material. Sections of the parametrial and right and
left pelvic lymph nodes were stained for keratin using AE1/AE3
antibody. The metastatic tumor cells are highlighted in the
affected lymph nodes, including a few ""occult"" metastatic tumor
cells in subcapsular sinus of the affected left parametrial lymph
node.

COMMENT: Gross and microscopic eva_uation of -_re hysterectomy
specimen demonstrates diffuse involvement (and replacement) of
mucosal surfaces (endocervical, lower uterine segment and
endometrial), cervical stromal tissues and myometrium by squamous
cell carcinoma. Sections from the transition zone of the cervix
demonstrate previous biopsy site changes in addition to mu tfocal
areas of squamous cell carcinoma in situ. These changes are also
seen in most sections from the lower uterine segment and
endometrium. Invasive squamous cell carcinoma erodes through the
cervical stroma and is present at the paracervical soft tissue
margins of resection, as well as adjacent to the distal
(paravaginal) margins of resection (considered positive margins. The
myometrium is diffusely involved by invasive squamous cell
carcinoma, with extension to the serosal surfaces. In the right
fundic region, carcinoma invades into the serosal surfaces of the
terminal ileum and appendix with extension through the muscularis
propria and towards the mucosal surfaces. The right oophorectomy
specimen demonstrates invasive squamous cell carcinoma (similar to
that seen elsewhere), secondarily involving a pre-existing
cystadenofibroma. The possibility of direct spread of the carcinoma
from the uterus to the right ovary cannot be excluded (versus
metastatic spread or ""co-synchronous primary"". The tumor appears
high grade with significant tumor-associated necrosis,
angiolymphatic vascular space invasion and a high rate of mitotic
activity.

3: UTERUS WITH ILEUM AND CECUM
Labeled ""uterus with ileum and cecum"", received fresh in the
Operating Room and subsequently fixed in formalin, is a 340 gram
total abdominal hysterectomy with attached left fallopian tube and
ovary, ileum, cecum, and appendix. :tie uterus is 10.0 cm from fundus
to cervix, 6.5 cm from cornu to cornu, and 5.5 cm from anterior to
posterior. The serosa is red-tan and diffusely roughened with
hemorrhagic red-tan soft tissue adhesions. The segment of ileum and
a portion of the appendix are adhesed to the right fundic region of
the uterus with a large amount of hemorrhagic soft tissue adhesions
and indurated adipose tissue. The anterior fundic region is also
diffusely nodular due to underlying tumor. The nodules range from.
1.0 to 3.5 cm in greatest dimension and coalesce with one another. A
small amount of parametrium is attached to the uterus and is
approximately 2.0 cm in maximum width on the right and 1.5 cm in
maximum width on the left. The cervix is 3.4 x 2.8 cm in the area
of the ectocervical region. The ectocervix is diffusely disrupted
with no normal cervical epithelium grossly identified. No vaginal
cuff is grossly identified. The endocervical canal is 3.5 cm long,
lined by velvety hyperemic mucosa. Cut section of the cervix
reveals tan-pink, somewhat fibrotic stroma. The endometrial cavity
is 4.2 cm long from fundus to upper endocervical canal with a
maximum width of 3.5 cm. The endometrium is entirely obliterated
with a somewhat papillated tan-pink diffusely hemorrhagic lesion
which grossly extends to, and involves, the lower uterine segment.
Focal areas of necrosis are present throughout the endometrial
lesion. No normal endometrium is grossly identified. The uterine
wall is 3.0 cm in maximum thickness. Cut section of the myometrium
reveals a semi -firm pale tan appearance and is continuous with the
endometrial tumor. The entire myometrium has a maximum thickness of
3.0 cm and is involved by tumor. Diffuse necrosis is also present
throughout. The lesion grossly extends to and disrupts the serosa,
predominantly along the posterior uterine wall. The tumor in the
region of the fundus also grossly invades the serosa of the segment
of terminal ileum. The left fallopian tube is 5.5 cm long and 0.6
cm in maximum diameter. No fimbria is grossly identified. A 1.0 x
0.8 x 0.7 cm orange-tan nodule is present in the region of the
fimbria. Cut section of the fallopian tube reveals a central patent
lumen. The left ovary is red-tan, generally smooth and 2.5 x 1.5 x
1.0 cm. Cut section of the left ovary reveals normal ovarian
parenchyma with several white -tan scattered corpora albicantia
identified. No tumor is grossly identified. The segment of
terminal ileum is 20 cm long with an average diameter of 2.5 cm.
The serosa of the terminal ileum is red-tan, diffusely granular with
numerous softtissue adhesions adhering it to the fundus of the
uterus. Theattached mesenteric adipose tissue has a maximum width
of 6.0 cm andis also adhesed to the posterior fundic region of the
uterus. Thesegment of terminal ileum is opened along the
antimesenteric border revealing pale tan, normally folded mucosa.
Cut section of the wall of the terminal ileum in the region of the
adhesion to the fundus of the uterus reveals infiltrative tumor
which grossly invades the muscularis of the terminal ileum, but does
not grossly invade the mucosa of the terminal ileum. The wailof
the terminal ileum is approximately 0.6 cm in maximum dimension.
The appendix is 7.0 cm long and 0.8 cm in maximum diameter. The
attached mesoappendix has a maximum width of 1.5 cm and is diffusely
hemorrhagic and indurated. The serosa of the appendix is red-tan
and diffusely granular with multiple soft tissue adhesions along the
proximal 2 cm adhering it to the fundic region of the uterus. Cut
section of the appendix reveals that the uterine tumor grossly
involved the serosa of the appendix, but does not involve tte wall
,fS of the appendix. A central patent 0.3 ;m maximum diameter lumen is
identified. The segment of cecum, including ileocecal valve, is 7.0
cm long with a maximum diameter of 4.5 cm. The serosa of the cecum
is red-tan with multiple red-tan hemorrhagic soft tissue adhesions.
No discrete areas of tumor nodules are grossly identified. The
segment of cecum is opened along the antimesenteric border revealing
slightly hyperemic tan-red normally folded mucosa. The wall of the
cecum is approximately 0.6 cm in maximum width. The cecum and
ileocecal valve appear grossly free of tumor. Dissection of the
pericolonic and adipose tissue reveals several tan-pink lymph nodes
ranging from 0.2 to 0.7 cm. Representative sections are submitted.

ADDENDUM
Although, accurate estimation of depth of invasion of the carcinoma
is precluded by suboptimal sections, in some sections it appears
to be greater than 50% invasion of the cervical wall. Foci of,
definite and other foci suspicious for lymphovascular space invasion
are present. Dr. has reviewed representative sections of
this case.

D.UTERUS, CERVIX FOR RESEAR'
Labeled with the patient's name,designated ""uterus, cervix"", and received in
formalin is a 529.5 gram hysterectomy specimen. No attached adnexal structures are present. The
uterus is approximately 14.0 x 9.5 x 7.5 cm. The cervical portion of the uterus is approximately 4.6 cm in
diameter, 3.5 cm in length between the two of them. The cervical os measures 1.5 cm in diameter. The
posterior vaginal cuff measures 4.5 cm x 1.1 x 0.2 cm. The endometrium is 5.0 cm long and 1.0 cm in
width and less than 0,1 cm throughout in thickness. The myometrial wall ranges in size from 1.5 to 3.0
cm in thickness.
The uterus is markedly distorted in shape due to the presence of a mass in the cervix and a large anterior
leiomyoma. The cervical mass is 6.8 x 5 .5 x 4.5 cm in greatest dimension and is friable ,diffusely necrotic
with areas of hemorrhage and with a well-circumscribed but infiltrative border. The cervical mass comes
within 0.3 cm of the anterior inked surface and less than 0.1 cm of the posterior inked surface. Superiorly
the cervical mass does not appear to be grossly invasive or extend beyond the lower uterine segment.
The anterior leiomyoma measures 8.5 x 7.5 x 7.5 cm and is composed of solid white-tan tissue with a
whorled appearance. Additionally there are multiple (about ten) intramural leiomyomas ranging in size
from 0.4 to 8.0 cm, one of which is subserosal .The myometrium is also suspicious for adenomyosis. No
other endometrial lesions are identified.

E. UTERUS. CERVIXandLabeled designated ""uterus ,cervix "",and received fresh and subsequently pinned
fixed in formalin is a 248 gram, intact hysterectomy specimen. The uterusmeasures 12.2 x 7.6 x 5.8 cm.
The cervix measures 6.2 cm long and up to 6.0 cm in diameter. The vaginal cuff along the anterior
aspect extends up to 1 .2 cm away from the cervix and along the posterior aspect extends up to 1.6 cm
away from the cervix.. The endometrial cavity measures 3.5 cm wide and 5.7 cm long. The endometrium
ranges in thickness from 0.2 to 0.4 cm in maximum thickness. The myometrium ranges in thickness from
1.0 to 2.8 cm in maximum thickness. The right paracervicat soft tissues extend up to 1.4 cm away from
the cervix and the left paracervical soft tissues extend up to 1 .6 cm away from the cervix.
The serosa is smooth ,glistening and red-tan. Within the cervix there is a large ,fungating ,pink-tan focally
necrotic mass with areas of hemorrhage present measuring 7.8 x 7.5 x 1.4 cm. The mass is fully
circumferential with possible involvement of the anterior and posterior lower uterine segments.The cut
surface of the mass reveals semiflrm pate tan tissue Intermixed mucous filled cyst that range from 0.3 to
0.7 cm in greatest dimension .Also the mass also grossly invades greater than 50% of the cervical
stroma and comes within 0 .2 cm of the inked serosa and 0 .7 cm of the vaginal cuff resection margin. The
paracervical soft tissues appear grossly free of tumor .No additiona llesions are identified.
The remaining endometrium is focally granular with pinpoint areas of hemorrhage. The nyometrium
consists of soft to rubbery pink-tan tissue .Along the uterine fundus one subserosal Ieiomyoma is

Justification: The description of the specimen includes various parts of the uterus such as the cervix, anterior and posterior lower uterine segments, and full thickness sections of the anterior and posterior uterine walls.

Laterality: Not provided
Justification: The laterality is not mentioned in the description, indicating that it could be applicable to either side or both sides of the uterus.

Histology: Adenocarcinoma or carcinoma
Justification: The perforated lesion with irregular borders and the mention of sentinel lymph nodes suggest a malignant process, likely adenocarcinoma or carcinoma. However, the specific histological diagnosis requires microscopic examination.

Microscopic Description and comment:
sections of the cervical tumor show an invasive poorly differentiated squamous
cell carcinoma with a prominent associated inflammatory response that in some
areas produces a lymphoepithelial carcinoma-like pattern. in many regions the
tumor cells show prominent clear cell change, which in some areas appears to be
a degenerative change. Despite the fact that the entire cervix was submitted
for microscopic examination, there is no evidence of clear cell adenocarcinoma.
We have reviewed the earlier biopsy ( I from this patient' that biopsy is

The specimen is received fresh in 6 containers designated with the patient's nameMS Gross Description
Part A is designated ""right common iliac lymph node"". The specimen consists of a 2.7 cm in
greatest dimension single lymph node. The cut surface is tan to pink with a slight lobular
architecture. The lymph node appears grossly positive for tumor involvement. A portion of
the lymph node is taken for the protocol.
Al Additional cross sections of the lymph node
Part B is designated ""cervix, uterus, bilateral tubes and ovaries"". The specimen consists of a
9.7 x 6.0 x 4.9 cm, 192 g uterus with bilateral attached ovaries and fallopian tubes. The
uterine serosal surface is tan to pink and distended by underlying myometrial nodules.
There are bilateral attached ovaries and fallopian tubes. The cervix is 3.2 cm in diameter.
Surrounding the cervix is a vaginal cuff from 2.3 cm to 2.7 cm in width. The vaginal mucosa
is tan and grossly normal. The left fallopian tube is 3.2 cm in length with a diameter of 0.6
cm and has a normal architecture. The left ovary is 2.7 cm in greatest dimension. The
ovarian cut surface contains a unilocular simple cyst, 0.7 cm in greatest dimension. The
right fallopian tube is 4.3 cm in length with a diameter of 0.6 cm and has a normal
architecture. The right ovary contains 2 unilocular cysts, 0.4 cm and 0.7 cm in greatest
dimension. The cervix contains a 2.3 x 1.4 x 0.5 cm tan lobular mass primarily involving the
posterior cervix. The cut surface of the mass demonstrates a lesion extending to a depth of
approximately 0.3 cm. The mass is 4 cm from the posterior vaginal surgical margin and 2.1
cm from the posterior paracervical soft tissue surgical margin, 2.7 cm from the left soft
tissue surgical margin, 3.3 cm from the right soft tissue surgical margin, and 2.7 cm from the
anterior soft tissue margin. The cut surface demonstrates the mass does superficially
extend to involve the anterior cervix. The mass does not grossly involve the lower uterine
segment.

MS Gross Description
The specimens are received fresh in three containers, each designated with the patient's
name
Part A is designated ""uterus, cervix, BSO"". The specimen consists of a total hysterectomy
specimen to include a uterus with attached cervix and attached bilateral adnexa. The left
fallopian tube with fimbriae that is moderately hemorrhagic is 2 cm in length and up to 0.7
cm in diameter. The ovary is tan-pink and 2 cm in greatest dimension. Bivalving reveals a
normal ovarian architecture as well as a 0.6 cm in greatest dimension cystic structure
containing a serosanguineous fluid. The right fallopian tube is also hemorrhagic, 4 cm in
length and up to 0.6 cm in diameter. The ovary is tan, gray-purple, 3.5 cm in greatest
dimension. Sectioning reveals a normal ovarian architecture as well as a few cystic
structures containing a serous to serosanguineous fluid ranging from 1.5 to 1.0 cm. There
is also a paratubal cyst containing a clear fluid and smooth inner lining, 0.6 cm in greatest
dimension.
The uterus cervix is 247 g, 13 x 8.5 x 5.9 cm. The serosa is tan-pink and predominantly
smooth. The paracervical/parametrial margin is inked black. The attached cervical cuff is 2
cm in depth approximately 12 o'clock and 2.5 at the 6 o'clock aspect. There is a large
cervical mass on the anterior cervix protruding through the os. Upon bivalving, the
endocervical canal is 2.5 cm and the endometrial cavity is 3.5 cm from cornu to cornu. The
distance from fundus to squamocolumnar junction is approximately 7.5 cm. This cervical
mass described above is 5.5 x 5.5 x 3.7 cm, approximately 3.2 cm from the closest vaginal
cuff resection margin (12 o'clock). It is also well away from the endometrial cavity.
Sectioning through the cervical mass is approximately 2.5 cm in depth and well away from
the paracervical, parametrial, and paravaginal margins (closest 2 cm, parametrial margin).
The endometrium is 0.4 cm in thickness and the myometrium is 2.7 cm in thickness. The
parenchyma is of normal uterine architecture. Sectioning the soft tissue on both the left and
right parametrial side, the right side has a small 0.4 cm nodule and the left has a 1.2 cm in
greatest dimension firm nodule. The specimen is submitted as per code of sections.

MS Microscopic Description
Sections of the left and right fallopian tubes and ovaries labeled Al and A2 exhibit
hemorrhagic corpus luteal cysts. Old corpora lutes are also seen. The accompanying
fallopian tubes are unremarkable. The right ovary shows a follicular cyst. A paratubal cyst is
also seen in the right fallopian tube.
Sections labeled A3 through A6 from the circumferential vaginal cuff margin show segments
of normally maturing squamous mucosa. No evidence of malignancy is seen in the multiple
sections examined.
Sections of the uterine body reveal a secretory endometrium. Areas of superficial
adenomyosis are identified. No evidence of malignancy is seen in the sections examined. Surgical Final ReportPage 3 of 5

Part A9 through Al 5 reveals multiple segments of cervix which show a large invasive
poorly-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Tumor necrosis is seen in several areas.
Focal apoptotic and keratinizing cells are seen at the base of the tumor. A glandular
component is not appreciated. Many of the tumor cells exhibit a large amount of eosinophilic
cytoplasm. Numerous atypical mitoses are seen. Koilocytic atypia is seen focally along the
surface. Overall, the tumor has a pushing margin.
Part A16 from the left parametrial nodule reveals a lymph node which exhibits metastatic
squamous cell carcinoma. No extranodal extension is seen.
Part A17 shows a small lymph node from the right parametrial region. This shows no
evidence of malignancy.
Part B from the right pelvic lymph nodes show metastatic squamous cell carcinoma in 1 of 9lymph nodes.
Part C from the left pelvic lymph nodes show 6 lymph nodes without evidence of
malignancy.

Specimen ""No. 1"" labeled ""Right Pelvic Lymph Node"" consists of one
1.5x0.5x0.5-cm tan portion of tissue. Half is submitted for frozen section
as ""lFS"". All tissue is submitted as ""iFS+l"".
Specimen ""No. 2"" labeled ""Right Pelvic Lymph Nodes"" consists of fragments of
fibrofatty tissue measuring in aggregate 4x3x1 cm. The specimen is
submitted as: ""2A"", one possible lymph node; ""2B"", one possible lymph node;
""2C"", remainder of adipose.
Specimen ""No. 3"" labeled ""Radical Hysterectomy Specimen"" consists of one
uterus without bilateral uterine tubes or ovaries, weighing 168 g and
measuring from fundus to cervix 8 cm, from cornu to cornu 5 cm, anterior to
posterior is 4 cm. The cervix is complete and received with vaginal cuff.
The cervical diameter is 2.5 cm, os is patent. An exophytic mass is
identified on the anterior and posterior aspect of cervix extending from the
6 o'clock position to 12 o'clock position and encompasses approximately one
half of exterior surface of cervix and extends into the endocervical canal.
The entire mass measures 3x2.8x2 cm. The endometrial cavity reveals a
spongy endometrium. Myometrium is homogenous and firm. Endometrial cavity
appears grossly uninvolved by tumor.

*****GROSS DESCRIPTION:*****
The specimens are received in seven properly labeled containers with the
patient' s nameand accession number.
A. The specimen is designated ""left perimetrium"" and consists of
two portions of tan to yellow soft tissue that are 1.8 x 1.2 x 0.4 cm and
1.5 x 1.0 x 0.7 cm. Each portion of tissue is bisected. TE 1
B. The specimen is designated ""right perimetrium"" and consists of
a 3.0 x 1.8 x 1.0 cm aggregate of multiple portions of tan-yellow soft
tissue. One of the portions of tissue contains a staple line. The
specimen is serially sectioned. RS 2
Summary of Cassettes : 81-2, entire specimen, only the staple line
remains in the container
C. The specimen is designated ""radical hysterectomy (uterus,
cervix, upper vagina)"" and consists of a 231. 4 gram uterus and cervix with
attached bilateral adnexal structures that is 9.6 cm from fundus to
posterior vaginal cuff margin, 4 .8 cm from cornu to cornu and 4.3 cm from
anterior to posterior. The serosa is tan-pink and smooth. Right and left
parametrium is present which is shaved and entirely submitted . The serosa,
cervical resection margins and parametrium are inked as follows: anterior
blue, posterior - black. Portions of anterior and posterior, grossly
unremarkable vaginal cuff is present which ranges in length from 0. 8 to 2.9
cm. The anterior vaginal cuff is tan-white, wrinkled and displays no
discrete lesions . The posterior vaginal cuff is tan-white to brown and
slightly thickened. No discrete lesions are identified on the mucosal
surface . The anterior ectocervical mucosa displays a 2.5 cm (width) x 1.3
cm (length) tan-brown, endophytic, ulcerated mass that is 2.5 cm from the
anterior vaginal cuff margin. Cut sections through the mass are tan -white,
smooth, have a maximum depth of 0.3 cm and are 1.5 cm from the blue-inked
stromal margin. The posterior ectocervix contains a red-brown to
gray-green, rubbery, exophytic massthat is 4.7 cm (width) x 2.5 cm
(length). The mass is 2.1 cm fromthe posterior vaginal cuff margin. Cut
sections through the mass are tan-pink to white, have a maximum depth of
1.9 cm and are 1.1 cm from the black-inked stromal margin. The anterior
mass is grossly confined to the ectocervix while the posterior mass extends
to involve the endocervical mucosa. The triangular endometrial cavity is
lined by a tan-pink to red, soft endometrium that is 0.2 cm in average
thickness. No discrete endometrial lesions are identified. The myometrium
is tan-pink, moderately trabeculated and contains three tan-white,
well-circumscribed, rubbery, whorled nodules that range from 0.4 cm in
greatest dimension to 0.7 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm. The nodules are located in the
intramural aspect of the anterior and posterior myometrium. Upon
sectioning, no areas of hemorrhage or necrosis are identified. The right
tubo-ovarian complex is 10.5 grams. The previously interrupted fimbriated
fallopian tube is 3.5 cm in length x 0.6 cm in diameter. The serosa is
purple and wrinkled. Cut sections reveal a lumen. The tan-yellow to
purple, focally cystic right ovary is 3.2 x 2.2 x 2.0 cm. The cut surfaces
are tan-white, lobulated and contain two smooth-walled, blood-filled cysts Page 4 of 5
that are 0.9 x 0.7 x 0.7 cm and 1.7 x 1.4 x 1.2 cm. Both blood-filled
cysts are consistent with hemorrhagic corpora lutea. The left tubo-ovarian
complex is 9.4 grams. The previously interrupted fimbriated fallopian tube
is 3.1 cm in length x 0.6 cm in diameter. The serosa is tan-pink and
smooth. Cut sections reveal a lumen. The tan-yellow to purple, focally
cystic left ovary is 2.9 x 2.1 x 1.9 cm. The cut surfaces are tan-white,
lobulated, and contain multiple smooth-walled, subcortical cysts which
range from 0.2 cm in greatest dimension to 1.4 x 1.0 x 0.9 cm. Some of the
cysts contain clotted blood and are consistent with hemorrhagic corpora
lutea. One cyst contains a thin, straw-colored fluid. RS 32

Histology: Unremarkable cervix, benign lymph nodes
Stage: pTlblNOMx (based on the AJCC staging provided)
Grade: Not provided
Behavior: Not applicable (as the diagnosis is benign)

The information provided in the pathology report suggests that the patient had an unremarkable cervix and benign periuterine lymph nodes. The AJCC staging indicates that there is no evidence of tumor invasion beyond the lamina propria (lbl), and there are no positive lymph nodes (N0) or metastasis (Mx). The laterality of the specimens indicates that the lymph nodes were collected from both the left and right sides of the pelvis. Overall, the report suggests that the patient has no evidence of malignancy in the cervix or lymph nodes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

sue is inked black for identification. The right and left parametrial tissues are
submitted in entirety. The ectocervix measures 4.3 x 3.2 cm. There is a 3.5 x 3.2 x 1.4
pink-tan polypoid exophytic mass arising from the right anterior portion of the cervix.
The most posterior aspect of the cervix is arbitrarily designated as 12:00. The mass
extends from 2:00 to 7:00. The external OS is deformed by the fungating mass but remains
patent. The tumor is grossly 2.4 cm from the closest vaginal margin (3:00). The external
surface of the tumor is tan and roughened and focally ulcerated. The cut surface is tan,
firm with friable areas. Grossly, the mass appears to extend into the cervical strorna to a
maximum depth of 0.7 cm. The tumor appears to extend into the endocervical. canal. The
remainder of the cervical mucosa is tan-pink, smooth and unremarkable. The endocervical
canal measures 3.3 cm in length and is covered by tan herring bone mucosa. The endometrial
cavity measures 3.2 cm in length x 2.1 cm from cornu to cornu and is covered by a tan,
predominantly flat mucosa with foci of hemorrhage. There is a 0.7 x 0.6 x 0.2 cm polypoid
projection from the posterior endometrial wall. The myometrium is tan, firm and
unremarkable with a maximum thickness of 1.3 cm. The left and right fallopian tubes are
fragmented and not patent. No fimbriated ends are identified. The left ovary is
tan-yellow to tan-white, smooth and unremarkable. The cut surface is tan to tan--yellow to
tan-white with multiple corpora albicantia. There is a 1.1 cm in diameter simple
unilocular cyst in the left ovary. The right ovary is tan to tan-yellow with a smooth
external surface. The cut surface is tan to tan-white with multiple corpora albicantia.

Frozen Section Pathologist:
Clinical History:
year-old female with history of stage III melanoma and a large abdominal mass.
Gross Description: Received are three containers labeled appropriately for this patient. Specimens A and B are received
fresh for frozen section.
Container A is additionally labeled ""left tube and ovary and abdominal mass"" and is received fresh for
frozen section. The container holds a salpingo-oophorectomy specimen measuring 25 x 22 x 11.5 cm and
weighing 900 grams. The ovarian serosal surface is primarily smooth with a few areas of nodularity.
These areas are inked blue. Sectioning reveals the ovary replaced by a tumor mass with solid and cystic
areas and filled with thick, yellow, mucinous material. Many solid areas have a stringy and friable quality
and some are overtly necrotic. A fimbriated fallopian tube is present measuring 4 cm in length x 1 cm in
width. There is a 2.5 cm paratubal cyst, but otherwise the fallopian tube is unremarkable.
Block Summary:
FSA1 - Frozen section remnant
A2-A3 - Sections of tumor from area suspicious for serosal surface involvement
A4-A6 - Tumor with residual normal ovarian parenchyma
A7-A14 - Representative sections of tumor
A15-A16 - Sections of fallopian tube away from the fimbriated end
A17 - Paratubal cyst
A18 - Fimbriated end
Container B is additionally labeled ""uterus, cervix, right fallopian tube and ovary"" and holds a
hysterectomy and unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy specimen weighing in total 290 grams. The uterus
measures as follows: height 12.5 cm, breadth at fundus 7.3 cm in anterior to posterior 4.8 cm. The
anterior soft tissue margin around the cervix and lower uterine segment is inked green and posterior
black.
The ectocervix has a white /tan and friable mass protruding through the os. Sectioning reveals a dilated
endocervical canal filled with tumor. It appears similar to the ovarian tumor with copious mucinous
discharge. The mass measures 4.9 cm in greatest height x at least 3.5 cm in width. It involves the
entirety of the cervix, circumferentially. No significant parametrial tissue is present. A vaginal cuff is also absent. The mass invades into but not through the cervical stroma being 0.6 cm
from the inked soft tissue margin at closest approach. The mass extends up into the lower uterine
segment.
The endometrium is red/brown and shaggy appearing in multiple areas. The thickness ranges from 0.3
to 0.7 cm. The myometrium is firm, white and trabeculated with multiple mural nodules reaching 2.8 cm
maximal size. Sectioning reveals several of these myometrial nodules in the posterior corpus to have
dark brown hemorrhagic contents and a multicystic appearance (size ranges from 0.9 to 1.2 cm). The
uterine serosa appears smooth and intact with no grossly apparent tumor implants.
The right fallopian tube and ovary are present and inked blue. The ovary appears enlarged measuring 4 x
2 x 1.7 cm, with nodular protrusions on the serosal surface. The cross section shows normal variegated
ovarian parenchyma with evidence of corpora lutea and small cystic areas filled with thin serosal fluid.
Tumor tissue is not identified. There are solid hemorrhagic areas present. The right fallopian tube
measures 7 cm in length x 1 cm in width. There is a 2.7 cm paratubal cyst. One area on the fallopian tube
has a shaggy appearance, ?round ligament tissue vs. tumor. There is residual left fallopian tube present.
Representative sections are submitted per block summary.

COMMENTS:
The tumor is a poorly differentiated invasive large cell
non-keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma,. The tumor has an
unusual distribution of completely replacing the endometrium
with diffuse invasion through the myometrium to involve the
serosa of the uterine corpus. Sections including the cervix
show an unremarkable transformation zone, but squamous cell
carcinoma is present in the proximal portion of the
endocervix and lower uterine segment region. The
possibility of the squamous cell carcinoma arising in the
endometrium was considered since the tumor appears to be
centered in the uterine corpus and squamous cell carcinomas

However, endocervical origin is favored since there is tumor
present in the upper portion of the endocervix. It is felt
to be more likely that the tumor originated in the
endocervix, which is much more common than endometrium, with
subsequent extension into the uterine corpus. The diagnosis
of primary squamous cell carcinoma of the endometrium is
generally made only when the cervix and endocervix are free
of neoplasm.

COMMENTS:
Appropriately controlled immunohistochemical stain for P53 performed on block G1 Is negative. While this does not exclude the possibility of a serous
carcinoma, primary serous carcinomas of the cervix are very rare and these lesion more likely represents a high grade endocervical adenocarc noma.

Gross Description:
The specimens are received in five containers labeled with the patient's name,
Part A is received in formalin labeled ""right internal iliac"" and consists of a
portion of yellow-tan fibroadipose tissue that is 2.5 x 1.2 x 0.5 cm. Sectioning
reveals two possible lymph nodes, 0.8 and 1 cm in greatest dimension. These
lymph nodes are each sectioned at 3 mm intervals and entirely submitted
separately in cassettes Al and A2.
Part B is received fresh for frozen section labeled ""left obturator sentinel
lymph node, FSB+X"" and consists of an aggregate of yellow-tan fibroadipose
tissue, 2 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm. A representative portion is submitted in toto for
frozen section microscopy.
The specimen is entirely submitted as follows:
131 residual frozen section tissue;
B2 remaining specimen.
Part C is received in formalin labeled ""right pelvic lymph node"" and consists of a portion of yellow -tan fibroadipose tissue, 5.5 x 3 x 1 .8 cm. Sectioning
reveals a few lymph nodes that range from 0 .6 cm up to 6.5 cm.
These lymph nodes are entirely submitted as follows:
C1 multiplewhole lymph nodes;
C2 one lymph node sectioned;
C3-4 one lymph node sectioned.
Part D is received in formalin labeled ""left pelvic lymph nodes ""and consists of
a portion of yellow -tan fibroadipose tissue ,5 x 3 by up to 2 cm. Sectioning
reveals a few lymph nodes ranging from 0.6 to 2.5 cm.
These lymph nodes are entirely submitted as follows:
D1 multiple whole lymph nodes;
D2 one lymph node trisected;
D3 one lymph node bisected;
D4 one lymph node bisected.
Part E is received fresh and subsequently placed in formalin labeled ""uterus and
cervix ""and consists of a uterus and cervix received with attached vaginal cuff.
The specimen has a weight of 149 grams and overall dimensions of 9 x 7 by up to
3.5 cm .The specimen is received with attached bilateral parametrial soft
tissues .The paracervical and parametrial tissues are inked.
The serosal surfaces of the specimen are purple-tan and predominantly smooth.
The surface of the vaginal cuff is purple -tan, wrinkled .The ectocervix is
remarkable for a gray -white, ill defined mass that has dimensions of 3 x 2.5 cm.
This mass surrounds the cervical os that is patent with a greatest dimension of
1.5 cm .Upon sectioning ,the aforementioned mass on the ectocervix extends into
the endocervical canal with the third dimension being 1 .9 cm. The mass appears
to be confined to the endocervical canal and does not appear to extend to the
lower uterine segment .The mass is at least 1 cm from the vaginal cuff margin.
The cut surface of the mass is tan-white ,firm and granular.
Sectioning through the uterine corpus reveals a pink -tan trabeculated myometrium
that has a thickness of 2.4 cm. The endometrial cavity has the usual
configuration and is lined by pink -tan, glistening endometrium with a thickness
up to 0.3 cm.
Sectioning through the right parametrial tissues reveals no definitive lymph
nodes.
Sectioning through the left parametrial soft tissue reveals one possible lymph
node , 0.4 cm.
No adnexal structures are present.
Representative sections are submitted as follows:
El vaginal cuff margin en face (12 to 3 o'clock); E2 vaginal cuff margin en face (3 to 6 o'clock);
E3 vaginal cuff margin en face (6 to 9 o 'clock);
E4 vaginal cuff margin en face (9 to 12 o'clock);
E5 cervical mass at 12 o 'clock;
E6 cervical mass at 3 o 'clock;
E7 cervical mass at 9 o'clock;
E8 cervical mass at 6 o 'clock;
E9 anterior lower uterine segment;
E10 posterior lower uterine segment;

The specimen includes a distorted uterus with attached cervix and ovaries, and multiple sections of the cervix and uterus are submitted for examination. The presence of a tumor in the endocervix and endometrium suggests a primary tumor site in the cervix and/or uterus.

Laterality: Not provided
The clinical history does not mention any laterality information, and the specimen includes both right and left tubes and ovaries. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the laterality based on the given information.

Histology: Not provided
The gross description does not include any information about the histological type of the tumor. Further examination in the microscope is required to determine the specific type of cancer.

Stage: Not provided
The clinical history does not mention any staging information, and the gross description does not provide enough details to determine the stage of the cancer. Staging will require additional information such as the size of the tumor, involvement of lymph nodes, and presence or absence of metastasis.

Grade: Not provided
The gross description does not include any information about the grade of the tumor. The grade refers to how different the cancer cells look from normal cells and how quickly the cancer is likely to grow and spread. This information will be determined by microscopic examination of the tissue sections.

Behavior: Malignant
The presence of a tumor in the endocervix and endometrium, as well as the gross description of the tumor, suggest that the behavior of this lesion is malignant.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AFS1,AFS2,AFS3 - uterus, cervix, resection: Invasive Squamous Cell
Carcinoma. Gross Description
A. Received fresh labeled ""uterus, cervix, tubes and ovaries, right
parametrium"" is a 249 g, 8.5 x 5.3 x 4.7 cm symmetrical uterine corpus
with attached, markedly expanded, 6.5 cm cervix and bilateral adnexa.
The serosa is smooth to scaberous tan-pink-red. A scant amount of soft
tan-pink-gold parametrial tissue is present along the right and left
lateral aspects. The cervix measures 5.5 cm from right to left and 5.3
cm from anterior to posterior. The anterior surface is inked blue and
the posterior surface is inked black .The annular 5.3 cm ectocervix
ranges from smooth tan-white to glistening white-pink in keeping with
tumor. A thin rim of wrinkled tan-white vaginal mucosa circumferences
the ectocervical margin. The specimen is opened along the lateral
aspects to show a circumferential soft tan-white cervical tumor. A
portion of the tumor and a portion of normal are submitted for tissue
procurement as requested .A frozen section is performed. On
sectioning, the tumor has a maximal thickness of 3 cm (invasive
thickness), however tumor replaces the entire 6.5 cm cervix. Carcinoma
extends to within less than 0.1 cm of the inked posterior surface. The
triangular 4.5 x 3.2 cm uterine cavity is lined by flat tan-pink-red
endometrium averaging 0.2 cm. The myometrium is smooth tan-pink and
measures up to 2.3 cm .A single, 0 .8cm tan-white intramural leiomyoma
is present anteriorly (see block 15). The rubbery tan-pink right and
left ovaries average 2 .8x 1.8 x 1.2 cm .The stroma of both ovaries is
pale tan with identifiable corpora albicantia. A few cystic structures
measuring up to 0.7 cm are present within the left ovary. The
centrally discontinuous tan-pink right and left fallopian tubes average
6.5 cm in length and range from 0.4-0.7 cm in diameter. RS 20

Justification: The findings of a tumor in the endometrium that mimics atypical complex hyperplasia, but is compatible with in situ spread of cervical tumor, suggest that the primary tumor site is the cervix and has spread to the endometrium. This is supported by the clinical information provided, which indicates a diagnosis of cervical cancer. The stage is determined based on the TNM system, where ""4"" indicates the tumor has extended beyond the true pelvis or has involved the mucosa of the bladder or rectum, and ""N1"" indicates there are positive nodes in the regional lymph nodes.

THIS REPORT."," Based on the pathology report, here are the details for the six categories:

Site: Uterine Cervix
Justification: The tumor was identified in the cervix, and invasive carcinoma was present in the additional posterior margin.

Laterality: Not provided
Justification: The report does not mention any laterality information for the tumor.

Histology: Squamous cell carcinoma
Justification: The tumor was diagnosed as squamous cell carcinoma, which is a type of cancer that begins in squamous cells, which are thin, flat cells that cover the surface of the cervix.

Stage: Not provided
Justification: The report does not provide information on the stage of the cancer.

Grade: Poorly differentiated/Undifferentiated
Justification: The tumor was poorly differentiated or undifferentiated, which means that the cells do not look like normal cells and are dividing and growing quickly.

Behavior: Malignant
Justification: The report indicates that the tumor is malignant, meaning it is cancerous and can invade nearby tissues and spread to other parts of the body.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cervical biopsy at 12 o'clock; D- Endocervical curettage/
The case is received In four parts ,each labeled with the patient's name
,medical record number and given accession number
and it is accompanied by a requisition form labeled with the same
name and accession number.
Part A :Received in formalin labeled ""A- CERVICAL SECTION"" is an
irregularly outlined ,1.0 x 0 .5 x 0.4 cm piece of tan-pink ,blood -stained
soft tissue. The specimen is embedded in a 3.5 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm aggregate of
deep red, well organized clot. The clot is serially sectioned to reveal
uniform, deep red, unremarkable surfaces .The specimen is submitted
entirely as follows :1: tissue
2-4: clot
Part B :Received in formalin labeled ""B- CX BX 9 O'CLOCK ' is a 0.6 x 0.6 x
0.3 cm circular aggregate of tan -white ,blood -stained tissue interspersed
with fragments of clot .The specimen is submitted in toto in one cassette.
Part C: Received in formalin labeled ""C- CX BX 12 O'CLOCK "" Is 1.0 x 1.0 x
0.3 cm circular aggregate of irregularly outlined fragments of tan -white,
blood -stained tissue interspersed with a moderate amount of dot. The
specimen is submitted in toto in one cassette.
Part D :Received in formalin labeled ""D- ECC "" is a cervical biopsy brush
with a 1.5 x 1.5 x 0 .4 cm circular aggregate of irregularly outlined
fragments of tan -white, blood -stained tissue interspersed with mucoid
material and dot. The specimen is submitted in toto in one cassette.

Microscopic Description
A-D: Sections show fragments of severely dysplastic squamous epithelium in a
papillary configuration ,with high grade nuclei and numerous mitotic figures
throughout There is evidence of stromal invasion on parts C and D. The
findings on parts A and B are worrisome but not definitive for invasion.
The size of the tumor and extent of stromal invasion cannot be further
assessed due to the extensive specimen fragmentation .lmmunostains (with
proper controls )were performed as follows :a stain for CK20 is negative
(part D ).A stain for ck7 is focally positive (part D ).A stain for p16 on
part C is positive ,which favors a cervical origin.
Intradepartmental consultation :has examined this case
and agrees with the findings and interpretation.

Sections of the endometrial and cervical biopsies show an invasive
adenocarcinoma .Immunohistochemical stains are performed to differentiate
the origin of the malignant glands ,with the appropriate controls, asfollows :p16 positive (strong ,diffuse ),and CEA positive (patchy );ER, andvimentin negative .The combined morphology and immunohistachemistry panel
favor an endocervical origin .Clinical correlation is recommended.
Intradepartmental consultation with Dr . Nho agrees withthe above diagnosis.

The grossly visible cervical squamous cell carcinoma, which measures 3.0 x
2.5 x 1.2 cm, is microscopically located 1.5 mm from the nearest inked
serosa. The tumor extends to a maximum depth of 12 mm in a 13.5 mm thick
section of cervix (section B13). The invasive carcinoma is grossly located
2.0 cm from the nearest vaginal cuff margin.

Specimen Material: A. Left parametrium, B. Radical hysterectomy, bilateral
tubes and ovaries, C. Left pelvic lymph node, D. Right pelvic lymph node
The case is received in four parts, each labeled with the patient's name
,medical record number and given accession number
and it is accompanied by a requisition form labeled with the same
name and accession number.
Part A. Received in formalin labeled ""LEFT PARAMETRIUM"" is an irregular
portion of fibrofatty tissue measuring 2.7 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm with an attached
suture. Within the fibrofatty tissue, an elongated gray-white vessel is
identified measuring 2.0 cm in length x 0.3 cm in diameter. There are no
discrete masses seen within the lumen. The specimen is submitted in its
entirety in cassettes A1--A3 with the vascular tissue adjacent to the suture
inked black to facilitate the embedding process in Al.
Part B. Received in formalin labeled ""RADICAL HYSTERECTOMY BILATERAL TUBES
AND OVARIES"", is a 148 gram, 9 cm from superior to inferior x 7 cm from
cornu to cornu x 2.8 cm from anterior to posterior uterus with bilateral
attached adnexa and attached cervix measuring 3.0 cm x 3.5 cm with a 0.7 cm
slit-like external os. The anterior surface is inked blue and posterior
surface is inked black. The serosa is tan-pink and hyperemic. The vaginal
cuff is present measuring 4 x 1.2 cm x 0.2 cm. The parametrial tissue is
present measuring 2 x 1 x 0.2 cm (right) and 1.5 x 1 x 0.5 cm (left). The
endometrium measures 0.2 cm thick; no focal lesions are seen. The
endometrial cavity measures 3 x 0.3 cm. There is a 1.5 x 1.2 cm gray-white
circumscribed submucosal nodule; the cut surface displays whorled, firm,
homogeneous tissue. The myometrium measures 1.5 cm thick.
The cervix displays a tan-yellow centrally ulcerative mass(3.0 x 2.5 x 1
cm) located on the posterior and anterior surface of the endocervix. The
mass appears to invade to a depth of 1.2 cm but is grossly 0.4 cm from the
Page 2 of 5 outer surface .The mass extends into the lower uterine segment .The mass
is located approximately 1.0 cm from the lower uterine segment and 2.0 cm
from vaginal cuff margin.
The right adnexa include a 4 x 2 x 1.5 cm ovary. The surface is tan-yellow,
smooth,hyperemic and glistening .Thereis a 1.5 x 1 x 0.6 cm smooth
unilocular cyst with serosanguineous fluid. The cut surface displays
tan-white to tan -yellow soft homogeneous tissue. There is a 4 cm in length
x 0.6 cm in diameter fimbriated right fallopian tube. The surface of the
fallopian tube is tan-pink, smooth and hyperemic. The cut surface displays
a pinpoint lumen.
The left adnexa include a 2 x 1.5 x 0.5 ovary with 4 cm in length, 0.6 cm in
diameter fimbriated fallopian tube. The surface of the ovary is tan-yellow,
smooth, and glistening; no lesion or excrescence is seen .The cut surface
displays tan-white to tan-yellow unremarkable tissue. The left fallopian
tubeserosa is tan-pink, smooth and hyperemic. The cut surface displays a
pinpoint lumen.

COMMENT
histologic sections of the cervical tumor show that it Is rojnposeei
oflarge nests of moderately differentiated sgu.,jmnus cell
carcinoma with focal keratinization. In some areas the neopl..astic
squamous cells display prominent cytoplasmic cl.partng, a feature
which was appreciated. on-this patient's prior biopsy
The growth pattern of the tumor is almost entirely exnphyt.l.c, a
feature which makes measurement-of the depth of inv. sior
difficult. However, the lesion Clearly invades the cervical
stroma. The point of deepest invasion occ'ir. at ?.he posterior
cervix (6:00 o'clock), w1tere the tumor invades to a depth of 5 mm
in a 20 mm thick cervix. There is no par.acer.vi cril 4;c,ft- ti-!sue
present on the poster.i-or cervical wall at thin. point. and the
serosal surface of the cervix therefore repro: -(rote E-he margin of
resection. Thni.s, the most deeply invasive tumor 1.s 't.:=, rim, fr. o~ts the
deep surgical resection margin. Prominent vascular sp..^r e invasion
is seen. No rumor is identified in the ^.trcri ne :cr_pus, the v,'r:ln.:.i

L%21d"," Site: The sample is from the cervix uteri.

Laterality: Not provided in the information given.

Histology: The histological diagnosis is squamous cell carcinoma.

Stage: Based on the TNM stage, it appears to be at least stage IB1 (T1b N0 M0).

Grade: The grade of the tumor is not provided in the information given.

Behavior: The behavior of this tumor is malignant, as it is a cancer.

Justification for choices:
Site: The sample was collected from the cervix uteri, which is stated multiple times throughout the text.
Laterality: There is no mention of laterality in the information provided.
Histology: The histological diagnosis is squamous cell carcinoma, which is mentioned in the ""Histological Diagnosis"" section and also indicated by the presence of keratinization and intercellular bridges (desmosomes) in the microscopic description.
Stage: The TNM stage can be determined from the information provided about the primary tumor, lymph nodes, and distant metastasis. In this case, it appears to be at least stage IB1 (T1b N0 M0), as there is no evidence of lymph node involvement or distant metastasis, but the tumor has invaded beyond the basement membrane of the cervix.
Grade: The grade of the tumor is not provided in the information given, so it cannot be determined with certainty. However, the presence of keratinization and intercellular bridges (desmosomes) may suggest a more differentiated, lower-grade tumor.
Behavior: The behavior of this tumor is malignant, as it is a cancer that can invade surrounding tissues and metastasize to other parts of the body. This is indicated by the TNM stage and the histological diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Department k$irman has been informed or is aware of the above discrepancy indiagnoses
Principal lnvestigator Signature Date"," Based on the data provided, here is the information organized into the six requested categories:

1. Site: The site of the tumor is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. However, it appears to be a breast cancer case based on the context.
2. Laterality: Not provided.
3. Histology: Infiltrating ductal carcinoma. This diagnosis is based on the initial pathology report and is inconsistent with the diagnosis provided on the Case Quality Control Form.
4. Stage: The stage of the cancer is not provided in the text.
5. Grade: Not provided.
6. Behavior: The behavior of the tumor is not explicitly mentioned, but it can be inferred to be malignant based on the diagnosis of infiltrating ductal carcinoma.

Justification for choice: I have chosen the diagnosis of infiltrating ductal carcinoma based on the context and the mention of ""mass formation"" and ""invasive carcinoma"" in the text. This diagnosis is inconsistent with the diagnosis provided on the Case Quality Control Form, which suggests that there may be a discrepancy between the two sources. The other categories are not provided or cannot be accurately determined based on the information given.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

R-i-l INuclear Atyp"," Site: The site of the primary tumor is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text, but it appears to be a form used for reporting on breast cancer, as many relevant markers and details have been included.

Laterality: Not provided. The laterality (left, right, or bilateral) of the tumor is not mentioned in the report.

Histology: The histological diagnosis is invasive carcinoma, as indicated by the presence of desmoplastic stroma and the absence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).

Stage: Based on the information provided, this appears to be a pT2N1M0 stage IIB breast cancer. There is no distant metastasis (M0), but there are positive lymph nodes (N1) and a relatively large primary tumor (pT2).

Grade: The grade of the tumor is not explicitly provided, but based on the description of the cells, it seems to be a high-grade carcinoma with marked nuclear atypia, increased mitotic activity, and necrosis.

Behavior: This is a malignant tumor, as indicated by the invasive nature of the cancer and the presence of lymph node metastasis. The behavior of this tumor is aggressive and life-threatening if not treated appropriately.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gross Description
The specimen is received in nine parts, each labeled with the patient's name
and medical record number.
Part A: Received fresh and labeled ""LEFT PARAMETRIAL NODE"" is a 1.0 x 0.8 x
0.2 cm pink-tan rubbery portion of soft tissue, which is submitted in toto
for frozen section as FSAI.
Part B: Received fresh and labeled ""UTERUS AND CERVIX"" is a 114 gram uterus
with attached cervix, vaginal cuff margin, and right fallopian tube and
ovary. The uterine body measures 4.8 x 4.5 x 3.3 cm, and the attached
cervix and vaginal cuff measure 2.6 x 4.5 x 3.2 cm. The vaginal cuff margin
is pink-tan, smooth and glistening, and the cervix is tan-brown to tan-red
and bosselated and displays an ill-defined as measuring 0.5 cm in diameter.
A representative section of the cervix at the 1 to 2 o'clock location is

bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy pelvic LND, (radical))
Gross Description
Part A: The specimen is received in formalin, labeled with the patient's
name, medical record number and ""RADICAL HYSTERECTOMY, BSO"", and consists of
a radical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingooophorectomy. The specimen
includes a uterus (90.0 grams, 8.0 cm in length x 4,5 cm cornu to cornu, 3.0
cm anterior to posterior), with a attached cervix (3.5 x 3 cm) and bilateral
adnexa. The right fallopian tube (5.0 cm in length x 0.4 cm in
circumference) is attached to a right ovary (2.5 x 1.7 x 0.3 cm). The left
fallopian tube (6.5 cm in length x 0.4 cm in circumference) is attached to a
left ovary (2.5 x 1.5 x 0.4 cm). Additionally, the specimen has a right
parametrium measuring 2.5 x 0.7 x 0.5 and 3.5 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm, respectively. The vagina cuff is surrounding the cervix and measures 1.5 cm in length.
The serosa is tan-pink, smooth and glistening with focal areas of adhesions
mostly at the lower posterior aspect. The anterior aspectis distorted by
the presence of an intramural nodule ( 2.0 x 1.8 cm ).The cervix has an
eroded surface (3.5 x 3.5 cm) with areas of hemorrhage predominantly between
3 and 6 o'clock. Peripherally to this area the cervix is partially covered
by a tan-pink, smooth and glistening mucosaextending into the vaginal cuff.
The cervical os (0.8 cm in greatest dimension) is irregular and is
surrounded by hemorrhagic irregular surface. The cervical canal (3.0 in
length x 0.8 cm circumference) has atan-pink herringbone mucosa and a focal
areaof irregularity with papillary like projection closest to the cervical
os which is extending into the cervical canal up to 2.0 cm. The endometrial
cavity (3.2 x 0.5 cm) is covered by a tan-pink, hemorrhagic endometrial
mucosa (0.1 cm in thickness). The fundic areahas a polypoid lesion (1.0 x
0.3 x 0.2 cm). The myometrium (1.5 to 1.2 cm in thickness) is red-brown,
with fine tan-white fibrous septation. There is a tan-white nodular mass
with a whorling cut appearance in the fundic area. No other discrete lesions
are grossly identified.
Both fallopian tubes have a fimbriated end and the serosa is tan-pink,
smooth and glistening with paratubal cysts varying in size from 0.1 to 0.3
cm in greatest dimension and filled with a yellow clear serous fluid.
Cross sectioning demonstrates tan-pink mucosa with a pinpoint lumen. No
discrete lesions are grossly identified.
Both ovaries have a tan-pink to tan-yellow cerebroid-like appearance of the
external surface. Arising from both external surfaces, there are cystic
lesions measuring on the right side 0.7 x 0.7 cm and on the left 0.7 x 0.5
cm. The cysts are filled with a hemorrhagic serous fluid. Additional cystic
lesions are grossly seen in the periphery of both ovaries varying from 0.3
to 0.5 cm in greatest dimension.

Part B: The specimen is received in formalin, labeled with the patient's
name, medical record number and ""RIGHT PELVIC LYMPH NODE"" and consists of
multiple irregular yellow-brown fragments of fibroadipose tissue measuring
in aggregate 5.0 x 3.5 x 1.0 cm. There are four possible lymph nodes
varying in size from 0.5 cm in greatest dimension to 3.0 x 0.7 x 0.3 cm.
Submitted in toto for permanent sections in cassettes Bl-B4.
Part C: The specimen is received in formalin, labeled with the patient's
name, medical record number and ""LEFT PELVIC LYMPH NODE"" and consists of
multiple yellow-brown irregular fragments of fibroadipose tissue measuring
in aggregate 4.5 x 3.0 x 1.0 cm. Three possible lymph nodes are found
varying in size from 1.0 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm to 3.0 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm. The specimen
is submitted in toto for permanent sections in cassettes Cl- C5.
Part D: The specimen is received in formalin, labeled with the patient's
name, medical record number and ""ANTERIOR VAGINAL MARGIN"" and consists of an
irregular fragment of tan-brown tissue (2.2 x 1.4 x 0.3 cm). One surface is
partially covered by a tan-brown irregular mucosa. The opposite surface is
irregular, red-brown with cautery artifact. Perpendicular cross sections
demonstrate a tan-white to tan-pink fibrotic cut surface. The specimen is
entirely submitted for permanent section in cassettes Dl-D3.

EBV by in-situ hybridization is negative. HPV immunohistochemical stain is
negative. The squamous cell carcinoma appears poorly differentiated,
however, there are also features suggestive of a possible
lymphoepithelial-like carcinoma, which is a subtype of squamous cell
carcinoma with a better prognosis than the typical poorly differentiated
squamous cell carcinoma.

PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS
CERVIX, BIOPSY:
- FRAGMENTS OF INVASIVE SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA
- PENDING ADDITIONAL WORKUP (SEE COMMENT)
Comment
The biopsy is fragmented and the depth of invasion cannot be assessed. The
tumor spans the entirety of tissue fragments with the largest fragment of
tumor measuring 4.0 mm in greatest dimension.
immunohistochemical stains show that the tumor cells are positive for CK
5/6, p63, and p16 and negative for CEA and S100. The morphologic and
immunohistochemical features support the diagnosis is squamous cell
carcinoma. The morphologic features, however, are unusual and further
classification is pending additional workup. The final diagnosis wil be
reported in an addendum.

CLINICAL HISTORY:
The patient is a year-old woman with invasive squamous cell carcinoma
of the cervix. Operative Procedure :Radical
hysterectomy with bilateral salpingectomy.
GROSS:
A. The first container is additionally labeled ""right pelvic lymph
node"" and consists of three fragments of tan-yellow fibroadipose tissue
which measure in aggregate 4.5 x 3.7 x 2.0 cm. Eleven potential lymph
nodes ranging in size form 0.2 up to 1.3 cm in greatest dimension are
identified. All lymph nodes are submitted intact. Summary of Sections:
A1- three potential lymph nodes intact.
A2 - four potential lymph nodes intact.
A3 - four potential lymph nodes intact.
B.The second container is additionally labeled ""right pelvic lymph
node ""and is received fresh for frozen section analysis .The specimen
consists of a red -tan fragment of fibroadipose tissue which measures 2.0
x 1.7 x 0.4 cm .Two lymph nodes are identified within the specimen.
All tissue is submitted for frozen section diagnosis BFS1. The frozen
section remnant is submitted in the identically labeled cassette.
C. The third container is additionally labeled ""left pelvic lymph
nodes"" and consists of two fragments of tan-yellow fibroadipose tissue
which measure in aggregate 5.3 x 4.8 x 1.2 cm. The specimen is
dissected revealing 12 potential lymph nodes ranging in size from 0.3 to
1.7 cm in greatest dimension.
Summary of Sections:
C1- one bisected lymph node (inked black), and two intact lymph nodes.
C2 - one bisected lymph node (inked black), and two intact lymph nodes.
C3 - six lymph nodes, intact.
D. The next container is additionally labeled ""left pelvic lymph nodes"" and is received fresh for frozen section diagnosis. The specimen
consists of a 1.3 x 1 .2 x 0.3 cm aggregate of fibroadipose tissue in
which two lymph nodes are identified .Entire specimen is submitted for
frozen section diagnosis as D1FS .The frozen section remnant is
submitted in identically labeled cassette.
E.Thenext container is additionally labeled ""uterus , cervix,
bilateral fallopian tubes and upper vagina and is received fresh for
TPF. The specimen consists of a 100 gm radical hysterectomy specimen
which measures 8.0 cm from fundus to cervix x 2.7 cm from anterior to
posterior x 3.2 cm from cornua to cornua .The specimen includes an
associated vaginal cuff, which measures 0.8 cm on the anterior aspect of
the specimen and 1 .9 cm on the posterior aspect of the specimen. The
right fallopian tube measures 6.7 x 0. 5 cm and the left fallopian tube
measures 6.1 x 0.6 cm. There is associated right parametrial tissue
which measures 2.7 x 2.2 x 0.7 cm and left parametrial tissue which
measures 3.1 x 2 .1 x 0.8 cm. The vaginal cuff margin has been inked
blue, and the cervical and lower uterine soft tissue resection margins
have been inked black.
The specimen is bivalved revealing a cervical mass which measures 2.9 x
2.3 x 1.4 cm and involves approximately 80 percent of the circumference
of the cervix. At the greatest depth of invasion , the tumor is 1.4 cm
deep in a cross -section that measures 2.3 cm to the nearest inked
resection margin .The cervical mass expands and then infiltrates towards the lower uterine segment. The remainder of the endometrium is
golden tan in color and without additional masses or lesions. The
myometrium is tan-pink and exhibits a normal whorled appearance without
identifiable lesions. The average endometrial thickness is 0.2 cm and
the average myometrial thickness is 1.4 cm.
The right fallopian tube has a uniform caliber on cross-section, and one
potential paratubal cyst is identified. Cross-sections of the left
fallopian tube reveal a normal caliber throughout without identified
masses or lesions.
The external surfaces of the uterus are smooth, glistening, tan-pink in
color, and intact. Dissection of the right and left parametria reveal
no discrete masses or lesions. Serial sections through the superior
portion of the endomyometrium reveal no masses or lesions.
Representative tissue was procured for potential future studies from
specimen E.
Summary of Sections:
El - representative right fallopian tube.
E2 - representative left fallopian tube.
E3 - right parametrial margin, en face.
E4 - left parametrial margin, en face.
E5 - anterior endomyometrium, full thickness. E6 - posterior endomyometrium, full thickness.
E7-E9 -tumor ,representative full thickness.

vaginal margin, bilateral tubes and ovaries, is a 165 gram specimen including an unopened
uterus (8.8 x 6.8 x 5.8 cm), right fallopian tube (6.3 cm in length 0.4 cm in diameter),
left fallopian tube (6.1 cm in length 0.4 cm in diameter). No ovaries are grossly
identified. The exocervix (2.6 x 2.3 cm) is covered by smooth glistening white mucosa. The
external os is circular and measures 0.7 cm in diameter. The endocervical canal (3.4 cm in
length) has a tan herringbone mucosa. The endometrial cavity (2.2 cm from cornu to cornu,
4.3 cm in length) has a tan/pink hemorrhagic endometrial lining.
The 12:00 portion of the cervix is designated as the anterior most portion of the cervix.
There is a 1.0 x 1.1 x 0.7 cm ulcerated lesion located at the 12:00 to 2:00 direction. The
lesion is 0.4 cm away from the nearest vaginal cuff margin. A frozen section is performed
on and research taken from the lesion. The remainder of the frozen section is submitted
for permanent sections.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
1.Received fresh labeled with the patient's name and ""radical hysterectomy specimen left
tube and ovary"" is a 209 g uterus, 9.6 x 4.6 x 5.8 cm, and an attached left
salpingo-oophorectomy with left fallopian tube, 7.5 in length and 0.9 cm in diameter, and
left ovary, 3.9 x 2.5 x 1.7 cm. The uterine serosal surface has a smooth, purple to
red-tan appearance and focally ragged around the lower uterine segment to cervix ending in
a ring shaped, tan-white portion of vaginal cuff. The cervix is smooth and pink-tan, 3.8 x
3.0 cm, with a slitlike os, 1.6 cm across. An irregular, tan-white to brown, mass is
observed protruding from the os opening. Upon opening the specimen the mass, 1.0 x 1.0 x
1.0 cm, grossly appears to involve only the distal portion of the endocervical canal, 3.6
x 1.0 cm, which is pale tan and slightly hemorrhagic with herringbone mucosa, and the
central ectocervix around the os. The endometrium is slightly hemorrhagic and averages
approximately 0.5 cm in thickness. Upon sectioning the remaining uterus, the myometrium has
an average thickness of 2.2 cm.

CON 4ENT :
The cervical biopsy (#1) shows fragments of gland-forming adenocarcinoma admixed with
fragments of carcinoma with solid non-glandular growth pattern and high mitotic rate. Some
of the fragments may contain a component of endocervical adenocarcinoma in situ; the degree
of back-to-back glandular confluency in one of the fragments, however, is diagnostic of
invasive adenocarcinoma. Both the gland-forming and solid components of tumor show strong
immunoreactivity for p16 compatible with endocervical primary. The solid mitotically
active component shows no evidence of immunoreactivity for neuroendocrine markers
(chromogranin, synaptophysin, CD56), stains positive for pan-keratin and CK7, and stains
negative for cytokeratin 5/6. These findings suggest that the solid component may
represent a poorly differentiated component of the adenocarcinoma and rule against a small
cell neuroendocrine or invasive squamous carcinoma component.

Laterality: The specimens are from both the left and right sides of the pelvis.

Histology: The histological diagnosis is not provided in the gross description. However, the presence of a large tumor mass in the cervix suggests a malignant process, such as cervical cancer.

Stage: The stage of the disease is not provided in the gross description. However, the size and extent of the tumor suggest that it may be at least in the advanced stages of the disease.

Grade: The grade of the tumor is not provided in the gross description.

Behavior: Based on the presence of a large tumor mass in the cervix, the behavior of the disease is likely to be aggressive and invasive.

Justification for the choice: The site, laterality, histology, stage, grade, and behavior are all important factors in the diagnosis and management of pelvic malignancies, including cervical cancer. While not all of this information is provided in the gross description, what is given suggests a significant and concerning pathological process that requires further investigation and treatment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

COMMENT(S)
A.The biopsy material was received fresh with tissue selected for
and tissue banking,
The biopsy shows a dense ,cellular proliferation of strands of epithelioid cells with
marked, nuclear pleomorphism, hyperchormatic nuclei and varying degrees of eosinophilic
cytoplasm. There are also numerous apoptotic cells as well as scattered mitoses .There is
an associated lymphohistiocytic infiltrate. Immunohistochemical stains performed include
P16, P63. 34BE12, CK5/6 and CEA. P16 shows strong, diffuse nuclear staining. P63 and
34BE12 show diffuse cytoplasmic staining. CK5/6 and CEA stain a minority of cells. These
stains are consistent with a squamous cell carcinoma. It is likely of cervical origin.
Pankeratin stains performed on the lymph nodes in Parts ""B"" and ""C"" are negative for
metastasis.

COMMENT:
reviewed slides E4 and E7 and concurs with the diagnosis.
Procedures used to establish the diagnosis:
Routine
Resident
Pathologist
Electronically signed,
In compliance with regulations ,the pathologist 's signature on this report
indicates that the case has been personally reviewed, and the diagnosis made or
confirmed by, the Attending Pathologist. Microscopic examination was used to
arrive at the diagnosis unless indicated otherwise. ADDENDUM REASON:
This addendum is issued to correct the histologic classification of the
carcinoma in part E.
The carcinoma is well differentiated, but is clearly invasive, is not exophytic
and does not meet criteria for well differentiated papillary villoglandular
carcinoma. I would interpret it as well differentiated endometrioid carcinoma.
In addition, the closest inked margin is approximately 1.4 cm. The remainder of
the diagnosis is unchanged.
This opinion was discussed with
Pathologist
Electronically signed
In compliance with regulations, the pathologist's signature on this report
indicates that the case has been personally reviewed, and the diagnosis made or
confirmed by, the Attending Pathologist. Microscopic examination was used to
arrive at the diagnosis unless indicated otherwise.

Justification: The diagnosis clearly indicates a papillary adenocarcinoma of the cervix.

Laterality: Not provided
Justification: The report does not mention any laterality for the tumor, so it cannot be determined if it is limited to one side or involves both sides.

Histology: Papillary adenocarcinoma
Justification: The diagnosis specifically states that the tumor is a papillary adenocarcinoma.

Stage: pT1bl (macroscopically visible lesion <= 4.0 cm in greatest dimension)
Justification: The report includes details about the size of the tumor and its depth of invasion, which are used to determine the stage.

Grade: G1 (well differentiated)
Justification: The diagnosis indicates that the tumor is well differentiated, which means it has a better prognosis compared to less differentiated tumors.

Behavior: Malignant
Justification: The diagnosis of papillary adenocarcinoma implies that the tumor is malignant and capable of spreading to other parts of the body.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gross Description:
A. Received fresh labeled with the patient's name and ""uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries"" and consists of a 121 gram
radical hysterectomy specimen with included bilateral tubes and ovaries measuring 8.5 cm from uterine fundus to cervical os, 4.7
cm from cornu to comu, and 4.0 cm from anterior to posterior. The serosa is pink-tan and smooth without gross evidence of
lesion. The vaginal cuff is measured prior to formalin fixation and measures 0.8 cm at the 12:00 position, 2.2 cm at the 6:00
position, 1.0 cm at the 3:00 position and 0.9 cm at the 9:00 position. The cervical os is slit like and measures 1.0 cm. There is a
2.5 x 2.4 x 2.9 cm white-tan ill-defined rubbery mass located at the cervical os and lower uterine segment of the anterior and
posterior uterus and appears to efface the cervix. The mass extends 2.0 cm beyond the cervical os. The right perimetrium
measures 3.0 x 1.9 x 1.3 cm, the left perimetrium measures 2.8 x 2.2 x 1.1 cm. The posterior resection margin is inked black, the
anterior resection margin is inked blue, and the circumferential vaginal cuff resection margin is inked green. The cervical os is
probed patent, and the uterus is bisected coronally to reveal a 2.5 x 1.2 x 0.4 cm endometrial cavity and a 3.0 x 0.6 cm
endocervical canal. The mass invades to a depth of 1.1 cm and is 0.2 cm from the outer surface. The mass extends into the
endocervical canal and is 0.8 cm from the vaginal cuff margin. The uterus is serially sectioned to reveal an average endometrial

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
1)Received in formalin, labeled with the patient' s name and ""sigmoid colon (tattoo near
distal margin), is a 1 4.0 cm segment of sigmoid colon (measuring 3.5 cm in proximal
circumference, 3.5 cm in mid and 4.5 cm in distal circumference) : Attached to the
colon is yellow-gold segment of mesocolon (5.5 cm in length and 1.9 cm in thickness).
Upon opening the colon, there is a pink-tan, centrally ulcerated tumor with serpentine
borders (3.1 x 2.1 x 0.5 cm) that involves approximately 30% of the circumference.
The tumor is 2.5 cm from the distal margin and 9.7 cm from the proximal resection
margin. The remaining mucosal surface is pink-tan and grossly unremarkable. One
possible diverticulum is identified in the mid portion of the bowel segment (0.9 x 0.4
cm). No polyps, ulcerations or perforations are identified. Thorough search for
possible lymph nodes reveals no nodes grossly suspicious for metastatic tumor.
Representative sections of the specimen are submitted as follows:

(6.5 x 4.5 x 4.5 cm), with attached cervix and vaginal cuff (1.2 cm in length), right
fallopian tube (4.5 cm in length and 0.3 cm in diameter), right ovary (2.1 x 0.9 x 0.6
cm), left fallopian tube (4.3 cm in length and 0.4 cm in diameter), and left ovary
(2.2 x 1 ,6 x 0.6 cm). There is a white -tan, firm mass (1.5 x 0.9 x 0.9 cat )located on
the anterior surface of the exocervix (3.0 x 2.5 cm )that grossly extends to the
posterior cervix .The mass appears to invade to a depth of 0.7 cm and is grossly 1.2
cm from the vaginal cuff margin .The external os is slightly distorted by the mass
and measures 0.3 cm in diameter. The endocervica lcanal (2.9 cm in length) has a tan
herringbone mucosa .The endometrial cavity (4.5 cm from cornu to cornu, 4.5 cm in
length has a tan -pink hemorrhagic endometrium (0.2 cm in average thickness). The
myometrium measures 1.1 cm in maximum thickness .The serosa is glistening and no
adhesions are identified. The fallopian tubes are patent and have fimbriated ends.
The right and left ovaries each have smooth white outer surfaces and multiple corpora
albicantia on cut surface. The right and left parametrial soft tissue is pale pink to
yellow-tan, lobulated and grossly unremarkable. The anterior surface of the uterus is
inked blue ,the posterior surface black. Representative sections of the specimen are
submitted as follows :

COMMENT :
This tumor has an unusual pattern with a solid, geographic growth pattern infiltrating
the stroma. In some areas definite gland lumina are identified. There is little or no
mucin production. Apoptosis is prominent. Special stained performed on the, previous
specimen support cervical primary, but do not definitively distinguish a cell
type. Adenocarcinoma is favored but poorly differentiated adenosquamous carcinoma is in the
differential diagnosis.
